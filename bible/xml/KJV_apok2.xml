    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was this;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and two.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="43">How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="50">He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="64">Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="53">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that they may come:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did them not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="38">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore now this saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="45">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath passed the time appointed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">There, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall up on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellers, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellers, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellers, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellers and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then I being grieved did weep, and in my sorrow prayed, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">O Lord, thou art just, and all thy works and all thy ways are mercy and truth, and thou judgest truly and justly for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Remember me, and look on me, punish me not for my sins and ignorances, and the sins of mg fathers, who have sinned before thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For they obeyed not thy commandments: wherefore thou hast delivered us for a spoil, and unto captivity, and unto death, and for a proverb of reproach to all the nations among whom we are dispersed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And now thy judgments are many and true: deal with me according to my sins and my fathers': because we have not kept thy commandments, neither have walked in truth before thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now therefore deal with me as seemeth best unto thee, and command my spirit to be taken from me, that I may be dissolved, and become earth: for it is profitable for me to die rather than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and have much sorrow: command therefore that I may now be delivered out of this distress, and go into the everlasting place: turn not thy face away from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It came to pass the same day, that in Ecbatane a city of Media Sara the daughter of Raguel was also reproached by her father's maids;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Because that she had been married to seven husbands, whom Asmodeus the evil spirit had killed, before they had lain with her. Dost thou not know, said they, that thou hast strangled thine husbands? thou hast had already seven husbands, neither wast thou named after any of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore dost thou beat us for them? if they be dead, go thy ways after them, let us never see of thee either son or daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Whe she heard these things, she was very sorrowful, so that she thought to have strangled herself; and she said, I am the only daughter of my father, and if I do this, it shall be a reproach unto him, and I shall bring his old age with sorrow unto the grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then she prayed toward the window, and said, Blessed art thou, O Lord my God, and thine holy and glorious name is blessed and honourable for ever: let all thy works praise thee for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And now, O Lord, I set I mine eyes and my face toward thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And say, Take me out of the earth, that I may hear no more the reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Thou knowest, Lord, that I am pure from all sin with man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And that I never polluted my name, nor the name of my father, in the land of my captivity: I am the only daughter of my father, neither hath he any child to be his heir, neither any near kinsman, nor any son of his alive, to whom I may keep myself for a wife: my seven husbands are already dead; and why should I live? but if it please not thee that I should die, command some regard to be had of me, and pity taken of me, that I hear no more reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So the prayers of them both were heard before the majesty of the great God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Raphael was sent to heal them both, that is, to scale away the whiteness of Tobit's eyes, and to give Sara the daughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit; and to bind Asmodeus the evil spirit; because she belonged to Tobias by right of inheritance. The selfsame time came Tobit home, and entered into his house, and Sara the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper chamber.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In that day Tobit remembered the money which he had committed to Gabael in Rages of Media,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And said with himself, I have wished for death; wherefore do I not call for my son Tobias that I may signify to him of the money before I die?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when he had called him, he said, My son, when I am dead, bury me; and despise not thy mother, but honour her all the days of thy life, and do that which shall please her, and grieve her not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Remember, my son, that she saw many dangers for thee, when thou wast in her womb: and when she is dead, bury her by me in one grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">My son, be mindful of the Lord our God all thy days, and let not thy will be set to sin, or to transgress his commandments: do uprightly all thy life long, and follow not the ways of unrighteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For if thou deal truly, thy doings shall prosperously succeed to thee, and to all them that live justly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Give alms of thy substance; and when thou givest alms, let not thine eye be envious, neither turn thy face from any poor, and the face of God shall not be turned away from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If thou hast abundance give alms accordingly: if thou have but a little, be not afraid to give according to that little:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For thou layest up a good treasure for thyself against the day of necessity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Because that alms do deliver from death, and suffereth not to come into darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For alms is a good gift unto all that give it in the sight of the most High.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Beware of all whoredom, my son, and chiefly take a wife of the seed of thy fathers, and take not a strange woman to wife, which is not of thy father's tribe: for we are the children of the prophets, Noe, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: remember, my son, that our fathers from the beginning, even that they all married wives of their own kindred, and were blessed in their children, and their seed shall inherit the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now therefore, my son, love thy brethren, and despise not in thy heart thy brethren, the sons and daughters of thy people, in not taking a wife of them: for in pride is destruction and much trouble, and in lewdness is decay and great want: for lewdness is the mother of famine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let not the wages of any man, which hath wrought for thee, tarry with thee, but give him it out of hand: for if thou serve God, he will also repay thee: be circumspect my son, in all things thou doest, and be wise in all thy conversation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Do that to no man which thou hatest: drink not wine to make thee drunken: neither let drunkenness go with thee in thy journey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Give of thy bread to the hungry, and of thy garments to them that are naked; and according to thine abundance give alms: and let not thine eye be envious, when thou givest alms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Pour out thy bread on the burial of the just, but give nothing to the wicked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Ask counsel of all that are wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Bless the Lord thy God alway, and desire of him that thy ways may be directed, and that all thy paths and counsels may prosper: for every nation hath not counsel; but the Lord himself giveth all good things, and he humbleth whom he will, as he will; now therefore, my son, remember my commandments, neither let them be put out of thy mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And now I signify this to they that I committed ten talents to Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages in Media.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And fear not, my son, that we are made poor: for thou hast much wealth, if thou fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Tobias then answered and said, Father, I will do all things which thou hast commanded me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But how can I receive the money, seeing I know him not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then he gave him the handwriting, and said unto him, Seek thee a man which may go with thee, whiles I yet live, and I will give him wages: and go and receive the money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore when he went to seek a man, he found Raphael that was an angel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But he knew not; and he said unto him, Canst thou go with me to Rages? and knowest thou those places well?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">To whom the angel said, I will go with thee, and I know the way well: for I have lodged with our brother Gabael.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Tobias said unto him, Tarry for me, till I tell my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then he said unto him, Go and tarry not. So he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have found one which will go with me. Then he said, Call him unto me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trusty man to go with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Tobit said unto him, Brother, shew me of what tribe and family thou art.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">To whom he said, Dost thou seek for a tribe or family, or an hired man to go with thy son? Then Tobit said unto him, I would know, brother, thy kindred and name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then he said, I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, and of thy brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Tobit said, Thou art welcome, brother; be not now angry with me, because I have enquired to know thy tribe and thy family; for thou art my brother, of an honest and good stock: for I know Ananias and Jonathas, sons of that great Samaias, as we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of the fruits; and they were not seduced with the error of our brethren: my brother, thou art of a good stock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But tell me, what wages shall I give thee? wilt thou a drachm a day, and things necessary, as to mine own son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yea, moreover, if ye return safe, I will add something to thy wages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So they were well pleased. Then said he to Tobias, Prepare thyself for the journey, and God send you a good journey. And when his son had prepared all things far the journey, his father said, Go thou with this man, and God, which dwelleth in heaven, prosper your journey, and the angel of God keep you company. So they went forth both, and the young man's dog with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, Why hast thou sent away our son? is he not the staff of our hand, in going in and out before us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Be not greedy to add money to money: but let it be as refuse in respect of our child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For that which the Lord hath given us to live with doth suffice us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then said Tobit to her, Take no care, my sister; he shall return in safety, and thine eyes shall see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the good angel will keep him company, and his journey shall be prosperous, and he shall return safe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then she made an end of weeping.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And as they went on their journey, they came in the evening to the river Tigris, and they lodged there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when the young man went down to wash himself, a fish leaped out of the river, and would have devoured him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the angel said unto him, Take the fish. And the young man laid hold of the fish, and drew it to land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">To whom the angel said, Open the fish, and take the heart and the liver and the gall, and put them up safely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So the young man did as the angel commanded him; and when they had roasted the fish, they did eat it: then they both went on their way, till they drew near to Ecbatane.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the young man said to the angel, Brother Azarias, to what use is the heart and the liver and the gal of the fish?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said unto him, Touching the heart and the liver, if a devil or an evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and the party shall be no more vexed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">As for the gall, it is good to anoint a man that hath whiteness in his eyes, and he shall be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when they were come near to Rages,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The angel said to the young man, Brother, to day we shall lodge with Raguel, who is thy cousin; he also hath one only daughter, named Sara; I will speak for her, that she may be given thee for a wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For to thee doth the right of her appertain, seeing thou only art of her kindred.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the maid is fair and wise: now therefore hear me, and I will speak to her father; and when we return from Rages we will celebrate the marriage: for I know that Raguel cannot marry her to another according to the law of Moses, but he shall be guilty of death, because the right of inheritance doth rather appertain to thee than to any other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the young man answered the angel, I have heard, brother Azarias that this maid hath been given to seven men, who all died in the marriage chamber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And now I am the only son of my father, and I am afraid, lest if I go in unto her, I die, as the other before: for a wicked spirit loveth her, which hurteth no body, but those which come unto her; wherefore I also fear lest I die, and bring my father's and my mother's life because of me to the grave with sorrow: for they have no other son to bury them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the angel said unto him, Dost thou not remember the precepts which thy father gave thee, that thou shouldest marry a wife of thine own kindred? wherefore hear me, O my brother; for she shall be given thee to wife; and make thou no reckoning of the evil spirit; for this same night shall she be given thee in marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when thou shalt come into the marriage chamber, thou shalt take the ashes of perfume, and shalt lay upon them some of the heart and liver of the fish, and shalt make a smoke with it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the devil shall smell it, and flee away, and never come again any more: but when thou shalt come to her, rise up both of you, and pray to God which is merciful, who will have pity on you, and save you: fear not, for she is appointed unto thee from the beginning; and thou shalt preserve her, and she shall go with thee. Moreover I suppose that she shall bear thee children. Now when Tobias had heard these things, he loved her, and his heart was effectually joined to her.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when they were come to Ecbatane, they came to the house of Raguel, and Sara met them: and after they had saluted one another, she brought them into the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then said Raguel to Edna his wife, How like is this young man to Tobit my cousin!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Raguel asked them, From whence are ye, brethren? To whom they said, We are of the sons of Nephthalim, which are captives in Nineve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then he said to them, Do ye know Tobit our kinsman? And they said, We know him. Then said he, Is he in good health?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they said, He is both alive, and in good health: and Tobias said, He is my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Raguel leaped up, and kissed him, and wept,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And blessed him, and said unto him, Thou art the son of an honest and good man. But when he had heard that Tobit was blind, he was sorrowful, and wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And likewise Edna his wife and Sara his daughter wept. Moreover they entertained them cheerfully; and after that they had killed a ram of the flock, they set store of meat on the table. Then said Tobias to Raphael, Brother Azarias, speak of those things of which thou didst talk in the way, and let this business be dispatched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So he communicated the matter with Raguel: and Raguel said to Tobias, Eat and drink, and make merry:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">I have given my daughter in marriage te seven men, who died that night they came in unto her: nevertheless for the present be merry. But Tobias said, I will eat nothing here, till we agree and swear one to another.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And called Edna his wife, and took paper, and did write an instrument of covenants, and sealed it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then they began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">After Raguel called his wife Edna, and said unto her, Sister, prepare another chamber, and bring her in thither.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when they had supped, they brought Tobias in unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and took the ashes of the perfumes, and put the heart and the liver of the fish thereupon, and made a smoke therewith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The which smell when the evil spirit had smelled, he fled into the utmost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And after that they were both shut in together, Tobias rose out of the bed, and said, Sister, arise, and let us pray that God would have pity on us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then began Tobias to say, Blessed art thou, O God of our fathers, and blessed is thy holy and glorious name for ever; let the heavens bless thee, and all thy creatures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Thou madest Adam, and gavest him Eve his wife for an helper and stay: of them came mankind: thou hast said, It is not good that man should be alone; let us make unto him an aid like unto himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for lush but uprightly: therefore mercifully ordain that we may become aged together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And she said with him, Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So they slept both that night. And Raguel arose, and went and made a grave,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Saying, I fear lest he also be dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Raguel was come into his house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said unto his wife Edna. Send one of the maids, and let her see whether he be alive: if he be not, that we may bury him, and no man know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So the maid opened the door, and went in, and found them both asleep,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And came forth, and told them that he was alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Raguel praised God, and said, O God, thou art worthy to be praised with all pure and holy praise; therefore let thy saints praise thee with all thy creatures; and let all thine angels and thine elect praise thee for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Thou art to be praised, for thou hast made me joyful; and that is not come to me which I suspected; but thou hast dealt with us according to thy great mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Thou art to be praised because thou hast had mercy of two that were the only begotten children of their fathers: grant them mercy, O Lord, and finish their life in health with joy and mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Raguel bade his servants to fill the grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he kept the wedding feast fourteen days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For before the days of the marriage were finished, Raguel had said unto him by an oath, that he should not depart till the fourteen days of the marriage were expired;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And then he should take the half of his goods, and go in safety to his father; and should have the rest when I and my wife be dead.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Tobias called Raphael, and said unto him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For Raguel hath sworn that I shall not depart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But my father counteth the days; and if I tarry long, he will be very sorry.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore he was very sorry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then his wife said unto him, My son is dead, seeing he stayeth long; and she began to wail him, and said,</VERS>

And she went out every day into the way which they went, and did eat no meat on the daytime, and ceased not whole nights to bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there. Then Tobias said to Raguel, Let me go, for my father and my mother look no more to see me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But his father in law said unto him, Tarry with me, and I will send to thy father, and they shall declare unto him how things go with thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">But they that sin are enemies to their own life.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And built in Ecbatane walls round about of stones hewn three cubits broad and six cubits long, and made the height of the wall seventy cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And set the towers thereof upon the gates of it an hundred cubits high, and the breadth thereof in the foundation threescore cubits:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he made the gates thereof, even gates that were raised to the height of seventy cubits, and the breadth of them was forty cubits, for the going forth of his mighty armies, and for the setting in array of his footmen:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Even in those days king Nabuchodonosor made war with king Arphaxad in the great plain, which is the plain in the borders of Ragau.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there came unto him all they that dwelt in the hill country, and all that dwelt by Euphrates, and Tigris and Hydaspes, and the plain of Arioch the king of the Elymeans, and very many nations of the sons of Chelod, assembled themselves to the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians sent unto all that dwelt in Persia, and to all that dwelt westward, and to those that dwelt in Cilicia, and Damascus, and Libanus, and Antilibanus, and to all that dwelt upon the sea coast,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Until ye come beyond Tanis and Memphis, and to all the inhabitants of Egypt, until ye come to the borders of Ethiopia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But all the inhabitants of the land made light of the commandment of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, neither went they with him to the battle; for they were not afraid of him: yea, he was before them as one man, and they sent away his ambassadors from them without effect, and with disgrace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore Nabuchodonosor was very angry with all this country, and sware by his throne and kingdom, that he would surely be avenged upon all those coasts of Cilicia, and Damascus, and Syria, and that he would slay with the sword all the inhabitants of the land of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and all Judea, and all that were in Egypt, till ye come to the borders of the two seas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then he marched in battle array with his power against king Arphaxad in the seventeenth year, and he prevailed in his battle: for he overthrew all the power of Arphaxad, and all his horsemen, and all his chariots,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And became lord of his cities, and came unto Ecbatane, and took the towers, and spoiled the streets thereof, and turned the beauty thereof into shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He took also Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau, and smote him through with his darts, and destroyed him utterly that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So he returned afterward to Nineve, both he and all his company of sundry nations being a very great multitude of men of war, and there he took his ease, and banqueted, both he and his army, an hundred and twenty days.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And in the eighteenth year, the two and twentieth day of the first month, there was talk in the house of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians that he should, as he said, avenge himself on all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So he called unto him all his officers, and all his nobles, and communicated with them his secret counsel, and concluded the afflicting of the whole earth out of his own mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then they decreed to destroy all flesh, that did not obey the commandment of his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he had ended his counsel, Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians called Holofernes the chief captain of his army, which was next unto him, and said unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Thus saith the great king, the lord of the whole earth, Behold, thou shalt go forth from my presence, and take with thee men that trust in their own strength, of footmen an hundred and twenty thousand; and the number of horses with their riders twelve thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And thou shalt go against all the west country, because they disobeyed my commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And thou shalt declare unto that they prepare for me earth and water: for I will go forth in my wrath against them and will cover the whole face of the earth with the feet of mine army, and I will give them for a spoil unto them:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But concerning them that rebel, let not thine eye spare them; but put them to the slaughter, and spoil them wheresoever thou goest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For as I live, and by the power of my kingdom, whatsoever I have spoken, that will I do by mine hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And take thou heed that thou transgress none of the commandments of thy lord, but accomplish them fully, as I have commanded thee, and defer not to do them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Holofernes went forth from the presence of his lord, and called ail the governors and captains, and the officers of the army of Assur;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And he ranged them, as a great army is ordered for the war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he took camels and asses for their carriages, a very great number; and sheep and oxen and goats without number for their provision:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And plenty of victual for every man of the army, and very much gold and silver out of the king's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then he went forth and all his power to go before king Nabuchodonosor in the voyage, and to cover all the face of the earth westward with their chariots, and horsemen, and their chosen footmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">A great number also sundry countries came with them like locusts, and like the sand of the earth: for the multitude was without number.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they went forth of Nineve three days' journey toward the plain of Bectileth, and pitched from Bectileth near the mountain which is at the left hand of the upper Cilicia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then he took all his army, his footmen, and horsemen and chariots, and went from thence into the hill country;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And destroyed Phud and Lud, and spoiled all the children of Rasses, and the children of Israel, which were toward the wilderness at the south of the land of the Chellians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then he went over Euphrates, and went through Mesopotamia, and destroyed all the high cities that were upon the river Arbonai, till ye come to the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he took the borders of Cilicia, and killed all that resisted him, and came to the borders of Japheth, which were toward the south, over against Arabia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He compassed also all the children of Madian, and burned up their tabernacles, and spoiled their sheepcotes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he went down into the plain of Damascus in the time of wheat harvest, and burnt up all their fields, and destroyed their flocks and herds, also he spoiled their cities, and utterly wasted their countries, and smote all their young men with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore the fear and dread of him fell upon all the inhabitants of the sea coasts, which were in Sidon and Tyrus, and them that dwelt in Sur and Ocina, and all that dwelt in Jemnaan; and they that dwelt in Azotus and Ascalon feared him greatly.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So they sent ambassadors unto him to treat of peace, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Also he came over against Esdraelon near unto Judea, over against the great strait of Judea.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the children of Israel, that dwelt in Judea, heard all that Holofernes the chief captain of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians had done to the nations, and after what manner he had spoiled all their temples, and brought them to nought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore they were exceedingly afraid of him, and were troubled for Jerusalem, and for the temple of the Lord their God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For they were newly returned from the captivity, and all the people of Judea were lately gathered together: and the vessels, and the altar, and the house, were sanctified after the profanation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore they sent into all the coasts of Samaria, and the villages and to Bethoron, and Belmen, and Jericho, and to Choba, and Esora, and to the valley of Salem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And possessed themselves beforehand of all the tops of the high mountains, and fortified the villages that were in them, and laid up victuals for the provision of war: for their fields were of late reaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Also Joacim the high priest, which was in those days in Jerusalem, wrote to them that dwelt in Bethulia, and Betomestham, which is over against Esdraelon toward the open country, near to Dothaim,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Charging them to keep the passages of the hill country: for by them there was an entrance into Judea, and it was easy to stop them that would come up, because the passage was straight, for two men at the most.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the children of Israel did as Joacim the high priest had commanded them, with the ancients of all the people of Israel, which dwelt at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then every man of Israel cried to God with great fervency, and with great vehemency did they humble their souls:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Both they, and their wives and their children, and their cattle, and every stranger and hireling, and their servants bought with money, put sackcloth upon their loins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus every man and women, and the little children, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, fell before the temple, and cast ashes upon their heads, and spread out their sackcloth before the face of the Lord: also they put sackcloth about the altar,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And cried to the God of Israel all with one consent earnestly, that he would not give their children for a prey, and their wives for a spoil, and the cities of their inheritance to destruction, and the sanctuary to profanation and reproach, and for the nations to rejoice at.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So God heard their prayers, and looked upon their afflictions: for the people fasted many days in all Judea and Jerusalem before the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Joacim the high priest, and all the priests that stood before the Lord, and they which ministered unto the Lord, had their loins girt with sackcloth, and offered the daily burnt offerings, with the vows and free gifts of the people,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And why have they determined not to come and meet me, more than all the inhabitants of the west.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said Achior, the captain of all the sons of Ammon, Let my lord now hear a word from the mouth of thy servant, and I will declare unto thee the truth concerning this people, which dwelleth near thee, and inhabiteth the hill countries: and there shall no lie come out of the mouth of thy servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">This people are descended of the Chaldeans:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they sojourned heretofore in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the gods of their fathers, which were in the land of Chaldea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For they left the way of their ancestors, and worshipped the God of heaven, the God whom they knew: so they cast them out from the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and sojourned there many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then their God commanded them to depart from the place where they sojourned, and to go into the land of Chanaan: where they dwelt, and were increased with gold and silver, and with very much cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But when a famine covered all the land of Chanaan, they went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, while they were nourished, and became there a great multitude, so that one could not number their nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore the king of Egypt rose up against them, and dealt subtilly with them, and brought them low with labouring in brick, and made them slaves.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And they cast forth before them the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, the Jebusite, and the Sychemite, and all the Gergesites, and they dwelt in that country many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And whilst they sinned not before their God, they prospered, because the God that hateth iniquity was with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But when they departed from the way which he appointed them, they were destroyed in many battles very sore, and were led captives into a land that was not their's, and the temple of their God was cast to the ground, and their cities were taken by the enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But now are they returned to their God, and are come up from the places where they were scattered, and have possessed Jerusalem, where their sanctuary is, and are seated in the hill country; for it was desolate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now therefore, my lord and governor, if there be any error against this people, and they sin against their God, let us consider that this shall be their ruin, and let us go up, and we shall overcome them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But if there be no iniquity in their nation, let my lord now pass by, lest their Lord defend them, and their God be for them, and we become a reproach before all the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when Achior had finished these sayings, all the people standing round about the tent murmured, and the chief men of Holofernes, and all that dwelt by the sea side, and in Moab, spake that he should kill him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">He will send his power, and will destroy them from the face of the earth, and their God shall not deliver them: but we his servants will destroy them as one man; for they are not able to sustain the power of our horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For with them we will tread them under foot, and their mountains shall be drunken with their blood, and their fields shall be filled with their dead bodies, and their footsteps shall not be able to stand before us, for they shall utterly perish, saith king Nabuchodonosor, lord of all the earth: for he said, None of my words shall be in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And thou, Achior, an hireling of Ammon, which hast spoken these words in the day of thine iniquity, shalt see my face no more from this day, until I take vengeance of this nation that came out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And then shall the sword of mine army, and the multitude of them that serve me, pass through thy sides, and thou shalt fall among their slain, when I return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore my servants shall bring thee back into the hill country, and shall set thee in one of the cities of the passages:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And thou shalt not perish, till thou be destroyed with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And if thou persuade thyself in thy mind that they shall be taken, let not thy countenance fall: I have spoken it, and none of my words shall be in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Holofernes commanded his servants, that waited in his tent, to take Achior, and bring him to Bethulia, and deliver him into the hands of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So his servants took him, and brought him out of the camp into the plain, and they went from the midst of the plain into the hill country, and came unto the fountains that were under Bethulia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when the men of the city saw them, they took up their weapons, and went out of the city to the top of the hill: and every man that used a sling kept them from coming up by casting of stones against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Nevertheless having gotten privily under the hill, they bound Achior, and cast him down, and left him at the foot of the hill, and returned to their lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But the Israelites descended from their city, and came unto him, and loosed him, and brought him to Bethulia, and presented him to the governors of the city:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Which were in those days Ozias the son of Micha, of the tribe of Simeon, and Chabris the son of Gothoniel, and Charmis the son of Melchiel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they called together all the ancients of the city, and all their youth ran together, and their women, to the assembly, and they set Achior in the midst of all their people. Then Ozias asked him of that which was done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he answered and declared unto them the words of the council of Holofernes, and all the words that he had spoken in the midst of the princes of Assur, and whatsoever Holofernes had spoken proudly against the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the people fell down and worshipped God, and cried unto God. saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">O Lord God of heaven, behold their pride, and pity the low estate of our nation, and look upon the face of those that are sanctified unto thee this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then they comforted Achior, and praised him greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Ozias took him out of the assembly unto his house, and made a feast to the elders; and they called on the God of Israel all that night for help.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The next day Holofernes commanded all his army, and all his people which were come to take his part, that they should remove their camp against Bethulia, to take aforehand the ascents of the hill country, and to make war against the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then their strong men removed their camps in that day, and the army of the men of war was an hundred and seventy thousand footmen, and twelve thousand horsemen, beside the baggage, and other men that were afoot among them, a very great multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they camped in the valley near unto Bethulia, by the fountain, and they spread themselves in breadth over Dothaim even to Belmaim, and in length from Bethulia unto Cynamon, which is over against Esdraelon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them, were greatly troubled, and said every one to his neighbour, Now will these men lick up the face of the earth; for neither the high mountains, nor the valleys, nor the hills, are able to bear their weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then every man took up his weapons of war, and when they had kindled fires upon their towers, they remained and watched all that night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But in the second day Holofernes brought forth all his horsemen in the sight of the children of Israel which were in Bethulia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And viewed the passages up to the city, and came to the fountains of their waters, and took them, and set garrisons of men of war over them, and he himself removed toward his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then came unto him all the chief of the children of Esau, and all the governors of the people of Moab, and the captains of the sea coast, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let our lord now hear a word, that there be not an overthrow in thine army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For this people of the children of Israel do not trust in their spears, but in the height of the mountains wherein they dwell, because it is not easy to come up to the tops of their mountains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now therefore, my lord, fight not against them in battle array, and there shall not so much as one man of thy people perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Remain in thy camp, and keep all the men of thine army, and let thy servants get into their hands the fountain of water, which issueth forth of the foot of the mountain:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For all the inhabitants of Bethulia have their water thence; so shall thirst kill them, and they shall give up their city, and we and our people shall go up to the tops of the mountains that are near, and will camp upon them, to watch that none go out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So they and their wives and their children shall be consumed with fire, and before the sword come against them, they shall be overthrown in the streets where they dwell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Thus shalt thou render them an evil reward; because they rebelled, and met not thy person peaceably.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And these words pleased Holofernes and all his servants, and he appointed to do as they had spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So the camp of the children of Ammon departed, and with them five thousand of the Assyrians, and they pitched in the valley, and took the waters, and the fountains of the waters of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the children of Esau went up with the children of Ammon, and camped in the hill country over against Dothaim: and they sent some of them toward the south, and toward the east over against Ekrebel, which is near unto Chusi, that is upon the brook Mochmur; and the rest of the army of the Assyrians camped in the plain, and covered the face of the whole land; and their tents and carriages were pitched to a very great multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the children of Israel cried unto the Lord their God, because their heart failed, for all their enemies had compassed them round about, and there was no way to escape out from among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thus all the company of Assur remained about them, both their footmen, chariots, and horsemen, four and thirty days, so that all their vessels of water failed all the inhibitants of Bethulia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the cisterns were emptied, and they had not water to drink their fill for one day; for they gave them drink by measure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore their young children were out of heart, and their women and young men fainted for thirst, and fell down in the streets of the city, and by the passages of the gates, and there was no longer any strength in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then all the people assembled to Ozias, and to the chief of the city, both young men, and women, and children, and cried with a loud voice, and said before all the elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God be judge between us and you: for ye have done us great injury, in that ye have not required peace of the children of Assur.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For now we have no helper: but God hath sold us into their hands, that we should be thrown down before them with thirst and great destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now therefore call them unto you, and deliver the whole city for a spoil to the people of Holofernes, and to all his army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it is better for us to be made a spoil unto them, than to die for thirst: for we will be his servants, that our souls may live, and not see the death of our infants before our eyes, nor our wives nor our children to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">We take to witness against you the heaven and the earth, and our God and Lord of our fathers, which punisheth us according to our sins and the sins of our fathers, that he do not according as we have said this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then there was great weeping with one consent in the midst of the assembly; and they cried unto the Lord God with a loud voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then said Ozias to them, Brethren, be of good courage, let us yet endure five days, in the which space the Lord our God may turn his mercy toward us; for he will not forsake us utterly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And if these days pass, and there come no help unto us, I will do according to your word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And he dispersed the people, every one to their own charge; and they went unto the walls and towers of their city, and sent the women and children into their houses: and they were very low brought in the city.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now at that time Judith heard thereof, which was the daughter of Merari, the son of Ox, the son of Joseph, the son of Ozel, the son of Elcia, the son of Ananias, the son of Gedeon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Acitho, the son of Eliu, the son of Eliab, the son of Nathanael, the son of Samael, the son of Salasadal, the son of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Manasses was her husband, of her tribe and kindred, who died in the barley harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For as he stood overseeing them that bound sheaves in the field, the heat came upon his head, and he fell on his bed, and died in the city of Bethulia: and they buried him with his fathers in the field between Dothaim and Balamo.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So Judith was a widow in her house three years and four months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And she made her a tent upon the top of her house, and put on sackcloth upon her loins and ware her widow's apparel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And she fasted all the days of her widowhood, save the eves of the sabbaths, and the sabbaths, and the eves of the new moons, and the new moons and the feasts and solemn days of the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">She was also of a goodly countenance, and very beautiful to behold: and her husband Manasses had left her gold, and silver, and menservants and maidservants, and cattle, and lands; and she remained upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there was none that gave her an ill word; ar she feared God greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now when she heard the evil words of the people against the governor, that they fainted for lack of water; for Judith had heard all the words that Ozias had spoken unto them, and that he had sworn to deliver the city unto the Assyrians after five days;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then she sent her waitingwoman, that had the government of all things that she had, to call Ozias and Chabris and Charmis, the ancients of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they came unto her, and she said unto them, Hear me now, O ye governors of the inhabitants of Bethulia: for your words that ye have spoken before the people this day are not right, touching this oath which ye made and pronounced between God and you, and have promised to deliver the city to our enemies, unless within these days the Lord turn to help you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And now who are ye that have tempted God this day, and stand instead of God among the children of men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And now try the Lord Almighty, but ye shall never know any thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For ye cannot find the depth of the heart of man, neither can ye perceive the things that he thinketh: then how can ye search out God, that hath made all these things, and know his mind, or comprehend his purpose? Nay, my brethren, provoke not the Lord our God to anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For if he will not help us within these five days, he hath power to defend us when he will, even every day, or to destroy us before our enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Do not bind the counsels of the Lord our God: for God is not as man, that he may be threatened; neither is he as the son of man, that he should be wavering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore let us wait for salvation of him, and call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it please him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there arose none in our age, neither is there any now in these days neither tribe, nor family, nor people, nor city among us, which worship gods made with hands, as hath been aforetime.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the which cause our fathers were given to the sword, and for a spoil, and had a great fall before our enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But we know none other god, therefore we trust that he will not dispise us, nor any of our nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For if we be taken so, all Judea shall lie waste, and our sanctuary shall be spoiled; and he will require the profanation thereof at our mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the slaughter of our brethren, and the captivity of the country, and the desolation of our inheritance, will he turn upon our heads among the Gentiles, wheresoever we shall be in bondage; and we shall be an offence and a reproach to all them that possess us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For our servitude shall not be directed to favour: but the Lord our God shall turn it to dishonour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now therefore, O brethren, let us shew an example to our brethren, because their hearts depend upon us, and the sanctuary, and the house, and the altar, rest upon us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Moreover let us give thanks to the Lord our God, which trieth us, even as he did our fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Remember what things he did to Abraham, and how he tried Isaac, and what happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, when he kept the sheep of Laban his mother's brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For he hath not tried us in the fire, as he did them, for the examination of their hearts, neither hath he taken vengeance on us: but the Lord doth scourge them that come near unto him, to admonish them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then said Ozias to her, All that thou hast spoken hast thou spoken with a good heart, and there is none that may gainsay thy words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For this is not the first day wherein thy wisdom is manifested; but from the beginning of thy days all the people have known thy understanding, because the disposition of thine heart is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But the people were very thirsty, and compelled us to do unto them as we have spoken, and to bring an oath upon ourselves, which we will not break.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore now pray thou for us, because thou art a godly woman, and the Lord will send us rain to fill our cisterns, and we shall faint no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then said Judith unto them, Hear me, and I will do a thing, which shall go throughout all generations to the children of our nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Ye shall stand this night in the gate, and I will go forth with my waitingwoman: and within the days that ye have promised to deliver the city to our enemies the Lord will visit Israel by mine hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But enquire not ye of mine act: for I will not declare it unto you, till the things be finished that I do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then said Ozias and the princes unto her, Go in peace, and the Lord God be before thee, to take vengeance on our enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">So they returned from the tent, and went to their wards.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Judith fell upon her face, and put ashes upon her head, and uncovered the sackcloth wherewith she was clothed; and about the time that the incense of that evening was offered in Jerusalem in the house of the Lord Judith cried with a loud voice, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom thou gavest a sword to take vengeance of the strangers, who loosened the girdle of a maid to defile her, and discovered the thigh to her shame, and polluted her virginity to her reproach; for thou saidst, It shall not be so; and yet they did so:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Wherefore thou gavest their rulers to be slain, so that they dyed their bed in blood, being deceived, and smotest the servants with their lords, and the lords upon their thrones;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And hast given their wives for a prey, and their daughters to be captives, and all their spoils to be divided among thy dear children; which were moved with thy zeal, and abhorred the pollution of their blood, and called upon thee for aid: O God, O my God, hear me also a widow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For thou hast wrought not only those things, but also the things which fell out before, and which ensued after; thou hast thought upon the things which are now, and which are to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yea, what things thou didst determine were ready at hand, and said, Lo, we are here: for all thy ways are prepared, and thy judgments are in thy foreknowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For, behold, the Assyrians are multiplied in their power; they are exalted with horse and man; they glory in the strength of their footmen; they trust in shield, and spear, and bow, and sling; and know not that thou art the Lord that breakest the battles: the Lord is thy name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Throw down their strength in thy power, and bring down their force in thy wrath: for they have purposed to defile thy sanctuary, and to pollute the tabernacle where thy glorious name resteth and to cast down with sword the horn of thy altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Behold their pride, and send thy wrath upon their heads: give into mine hand, which am a widow, the power that I have conceived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Smite by the deceit of my lips the servant with the prince, and the prince with the servant: break down their stateliness by the hand of a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For thy power standeth not in multitude nor thy might in strong men: for thou art a God of the afflicted, an helper of the oppressed, an upholder of the weak, a protector of the forlorn, a saviour of them that are without hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I pray thee, I pray thee, O God of my father, and God of the inheritance of Israel, Lord of the heavens and earth, Creator of the waters, king of every creature, hear thou my prayer:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And make my speech and deceit to be their wound and stripe, who have purposed cruel things against thy covenant, and thy hallowed house, and against the top of Sion, and against the house of the possession of thy children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And make every nation and tribe to acknowledge that thou art the God of all power and might, and that there is none other that protecteth the people of Israel but thou.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after that she had ceased to cry unto the God of Israel, and bad made an end of all these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">She rose where she had fallen down, and called her maid, and went down into the house in the which she abode in the sabbath days, and in her feast days,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And pulled off the sackcloth which she had on, and put off the garments of her widowhood, and washed her body all over with water, and anointed herself with precious ointment, and braided the hair of her head, and put on a tire upon it, and put on her garments of gladness, wherewith she was clad during the life of Manasses her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And she took sandals upon her feet, and put about her her bracelets, and her chains, and her rings, and her earrings, and all her ornaments, and decked herself bravely, to allure the eyes of all men that should see her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then she gave her maid a bottle of wine, and a cruse of oil, and filled a bag with parched corn, and lumps of figs, and with fine bread; so she folded all these things together, and laid them upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Thus they went forth to the gate of the city of Bethulia, and found standing there Ozias and the ancients of the city, Chabris and Charmis.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when they saw her, that her countenance was altered, and her apparel was changed, they wondered at her beauty very greatly, and said unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The God, the God of our fathers give thee favour, and accomplish thine enterprizes to the glory of the children of Israel, and to the exaltation of Jerusalem. Then they worshipped God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she said unto them, Command the gates of the city to be opened unto me, that I may go forth to accomplish the things whereof ye have spoken with me. So they commanded the young men to open unto her, as she had spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when they had done so, Judith went out, she, and her maid with her; and the men of the city looked after her, until she was gone down the mountain, and till she had passed the valley, and could see her no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus they went straight forth in the valley: and the first watch of the Assyrians met her,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And took her, and asked her, Of what people art thou? and whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am a woman of the Hebrews, and am fled from them: for they shall be given you to be consumed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I am coming before Holofernes the chief captain of your army, to declare words of truth; and I will shew him a way, whereby he shall go, and win all the hill country, without losing the body or life of any one of his men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now when the men heard her words, and beheld her countenance, they wondered greatly at her beauty, and said unto her,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Thou hast saved thy life, in that thou hast hasted to come down to the presence of our lord: now therefore come to his tent, and some of us shall conduct thee, until they have delivered thee to his hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when thou standest before him, be not afraid in thine heart, but shew unto him according to thy word; and he will entreat thee well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then they chose out of them an hundred men to accompany her and her maid; and they brought her to the tent of Holofernes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then was there a concourse throughout all the camp: for her coming was noised among the tents, and they came about her, as she stood without the tent of Holofernes, till they told him of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they wondered at her beauty, and admired the children of Israel because of her, and every one said to his neighbour, Who would despise this people, that have among them such women? surely it is not good that one man of them be left who being let go might deceive the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they that lay near Holofernes went out, and all his servants and they brought her into the tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now Holofernes rested upon his bed under a canopy, which was woven with purple, and gold, and emeralds, and precious stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So they shewed him of her; and he came out before his tent with silver lamps going before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when Judith was come before him and his servants they all marvelled at the beauty of her countenance; and she fell down upon her face, and did reverence unto him: and his servants took her up.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then said Holofernes unto her, Woman, be of good comfort, fear not in thine heart: for I never hurt any that was willing to serve Nabuchodonosor, the king of all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now therefore, if thy people that dwelleth in the mountains had not set light by me, I would not have lifted up my spear against them: but they have done these things to themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But now tell me wherefore thou art fled from them, and art come unto us: for thou art come for safeguard; be of good comfort, thou shalt live this night, and hereafter:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For none shall hurt thee, but entreat thee well, as they do the servants of king Nabuchodonosor my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Judith said unto him, Receive the words of thy servant, and suffer thine handmaid to speak in thy presence, and I will declare no lie to my lord this night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And if thou wilt follow the words of thine handmaid, God will bring the thing perfectly to pass by thee; and my lord shall not fail of his purposes.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">For we have heard of thy wisdom and thy policies, and it is reported in all the earth, that thou only art excellent in all the kingdom, and mighty in knowledge, and wonderful in feats of war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now as concerning the matter, which Achior did speak in thy council, we have heard his words; for the men of Bethulia saved him, and he declared unto them all that he had spoken unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore, O lord and governor, respect not his word; but lay it up in thine heart, for it is true: for our nation shall not be punished, neither can sword prevail against them, except they sin against their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now, that my lord be not defeated and frustrate of his purpose, even death is now fallen upon them, and their sin hath overtaken them, wherewith they will provoke their God to anger whensoever they shall do that which is not fit to be done:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For their victuals fail them, and all their water is scant, and they have determined to lay hands upon their cattle, and purposed to consume all those things, that God hath forbidden them to eat by his laws:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And are resolved to spend the firstfruits of the the tenths of wine and oil, which they had sanctified, and reserved for the priests that serve in Jerusalem before the face of our God; the which things it is not lawful for any of the people so much as to touch with their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For they have sent some to Jerusalem, because they also that dwell there have done the like, to bring them a licence from the senate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now when they shall bring them word, they will forthwith do it, and they shall be given to thee to be destroyed the same day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Wherefore I thine handmaid, knowing all this, am fled from their presence; and God hath sent me to work things with thee, whereat all the earth shall be astonished, and whosoever shall hear it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For thy servant is religious, and serveth the God of heaven day and night: now therefore, my lord, I will remain with thee, and thy servant will go out by night into the valley, and I will pray unto God, and he will tell me when they have committed their sins:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Likewise Holofernes said unto her. God hath done well to send thee before the people, that strength might be in our hands and destruction upon them that lightly regard my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And now thou art both beautiful in thy countenance, and witty in thy words: surely if thou do as thou hast spoken thy God shall be my God, and thou shalt dwell in the house of king Nabuchodonosor, and shalt be renowned through the whole earth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then he commanded to bring her in where his plate was set; and bade that they should prepare for her of his own meats, and that she should drink of his own wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Judith said, I will not eat thereof, lest there be an offence: but provision shall be made for me of the things that I have brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Holofernes said unto her, If thy provision should fail, how should we give thee the like? for there be none with us of thy nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said Judith unto him As thy soul liveth, my lord, thine handmaid shall not spend those things that I have, before the Lord work by mine hand the things that he hath determined.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the servants of Holofernes brought her into the tent, and she slept till midnight, and she arose when it was toward the morning watch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And sent to Holofernes, saving, Let my lord now command that thine handmaid may go forth unto prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Holofernes commanded his guard that they should not stay her: thus she abode in the camp three days, and went out in the night into the valley of Bethulia, and washed herself in a fountain of water by the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when she came out, she besought the Lord God of Israel to direct her way to the raising up of the children of her people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">For, lo, it will be a shame for our person, if we shall let such a woman go, not having had her company; for if we draw her not unto us, she will laugh us to scorn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then went Bagoas from the presence of Holofernes, and came to her, and he said, Let not this fair damsel fear to come to my lord, and to be honoured in his presence, and drink wine, and be merry with us and be made this day as one of the daughters of the Assyrians, which serve in the house of Nabuchodonosor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then said Judith unto him, Who am I now, that I should gainsay my lord? surely whatsoever pleaseth him I will do speedily, and it shall be my joy unto the day of my death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So she arose, and decked herself with her apparel and all her woman's attire, and her maid went and laid soft skins on the ground for her over against Holofernes, which she had received of Bagoas far her daily use, that she might sit and eat upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now when Judith came in and sat down, Holofernes his heart was ravished with her, and his mind was moved, and he desired greatly her company; for he waited a time to deceive her, from the day that he had seen her.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">So Judith said, I will drink now, my lord, because my life is magnified in me this day more than all the days since I was born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had prepared.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And Judith was left along in the tent, and Holofernes lying along upon his bed: for he was filled with wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now Judith had commanded her maid to stand without her bedchamber, and to wait for her. coming forth, as she did daily: for she said she would go forth to her prayers, and she spake to Bagoas according to the same purpose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So all went forth and none was left in the bedchamber, neither little nor great. Then Judith, standing by his bed, said in her heart, O Lord God of all power, look at this present upon the works of mine hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For now is the time to help thine inheritance, and to execute thine enterprizes to the destruction of the enemies which are risen against us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And tumbled his body down from the bed, and pulled down the canopy from the pillars; and anon after she went forth, and gave Holofernes his head to her maid;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And she put it in her bag of meat: so they twain went together according to their custom unto prayer: and when they passed the camp, they compassed the valley, and went up the mountain of Bethulia, and came to the gates thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said Judith afar off, to the watchmen at the gate, Open, open now the gate: God, even our God, is with us, to shew his power yet in Jerusalem, and his forces against the enemy, as he hath even done this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when the men of her city heard her voice, they made haste to go down to the gate of their city, and they called the elders of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And then they ran all together, both small and great, for it was strange unto them that she was come: so they opened the gate, and received them, and made a fire for a light, and stood round about them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then she said to them with a loud voice, Praise, praise God, praise God, I say, for he hath not taken away his mercy from the house of Israel, but hath destroyed our enemies by mine hands this night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So she took the head out of the bag, and shewed it, and said unto them, behold the head of Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Assur, and behold the canopy, wherein he did lie in his drunkenness; and the Lord hath smitten him by the hand of a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As the Lord liveth, who hath kept me in my way that I went, my countenance hath deceived him to his destruction, and yet hath he not committed sin with me, to defile and shame me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then all the people were wonderfully astonished, and bowed themselves and worshipped God, and said with one accord, Blessed be thou, O our God, which hast this day brought to nought the enemies of thy people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then said Ozias unto her, O daughter, blessed art thou of the most high God above all the women upon the earth; and blessed be the Lord God, which hath created the heavens and the earth, which hath directed thee to the cutting off of the head of the chief of our enemies.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And so soon as the morning shall appear, and the sun shall come forth upon the earth, take ye every one his weapons, and go forth every valiant man out of the city, and set ye a captain over them, as though ye would go down into the field toward the watch of the Assyrians; but go not down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then they shall take their armour, and shall go into their camp, and raise up the captains of the army of Assur, and shall run to the tent of Holofernes, but shall not find him: then fear shall fall upon them, and they shall flee before your face.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty took his mind prisoner, and the fauchion passed through his neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Persians quaked at her boldness, and the Medes were daunted at her hardiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then my afflicted shouted for joy, and my weak ones cried aloud; but they were astonished: these lifted up their voices, but they were overthrown.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The sons of the damsels have pierced them through, and wounded them as fugatives' children: they perished by the battle of the Lord.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="68" bname="Wisdom" bsname="Wis">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <CAPTION vref="1">This Jesus was the son of Sirach, and grandchild to Jesus of the same name with him: this man therefore lived in the latter times, after the people had been led away captive, and called home a again, and almost after all the prophets. Now his grandfather Jesus, as he himself witnesseth, was a man of great diligence and wisdom among the Hebrews, who did not only gather the grave and short sentences of wise men, that had been before him, but himself also uttered some of his own, full of much understanding and wisdom. When as therefore the first Jesus died, leaving this book almost perfected, Sirach his son receiving it after him left it to his own son Jesus, who, having gotten it into his hands, compiled it all orderly into one volume, and called it Wisdom, intituling it both by his own name, his father's name, and his grandfather's; alluring the hearer by the very name of Wisdom to have a greater love to the study of this book. It containeth therefore wise sayings, dark sentences, and parables, and certain particular ancient godly stories of men that pleased God; also his prayer and song; moreover, what benefits God had vouchsafed his people, and what plagues he had heaped upon their enemies. This Jesus did imitate Solomon, and was no less famous for wisdom and learning, both being indeed a man of great learning, and so reputed also. [The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach.] Whereas many and great things have been delivered unto us by the law and the prophets, and by others that have followed their steps, for the which things Israel ought to be commended for learning and wisdom; and whereof not only the readers must needs become skilful themselves, but also they that desire to learn be able to profit them which are without, both by speaking and writing: my grandfather Jesus, when he had much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books of our fathers, and had gotten therein good judgment, was drawn on also himself to write something pertaining to learning and wisdom; to the intent that those which are desirous to learn, and are addicted to these things, might profit much more in living according to the law. Wherefore let me intreat you to read it with favour and attention, and to pardon us, wherein we may seem to come short of some words, which we have laboured to interpret. For the same things uttered in Hebrew, and translated into another tongue, have not the same force in them: and not only these things, but the law itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Euergetes was king, and continuing there some time, I found a book of no small learning: therefore I thought it most necessary for me to bestow some diligence and travail to interpret it; using great watchfulness and skill in that space to bring the book to an end, and set it forth for them also, which in a strange country are willing to learn, being prepared before in manners to live after the law.</CAPTION>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And incorruption maketh us near unto God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres, O ye kings of the people, honour wisdom, that ye may reign for evermore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Neither will I go with consuming envy; for such a man shall have no fellowship with wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world: and a wise king is the upholding of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Receive therefore instruction through my words, and it shall do you good.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I myself also am a mortal man, like to all, and the offspring of him that was first made of the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And in my mother's womb was fashioned to be flesh in the time of ten months, being compacted in blood, of the seed of man, and the pleasure that came with sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when I was born, I drew in the common air, and fell upon the earth, which is of like nature, and the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and that with cares.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For there is no king that had any other beginning of birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wherefore I prayed, and understanding was given me: I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I preferred her before sceptres and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in comparison of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Neither compared I unto her any precious stone, because all gold in respect of her is as a little sand, and silver shall be counted as clay before her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of light: for the light that cometh from her never goeth out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All good things together came to me with her, and innumerable riches in her hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I rejoiced in them all, because wisdom goeth before them: and I knew not that she was the mother of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I learned diligently, and do communicate her liberally: I do not hide her riches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For she is a treasure unto men that never faileth: which they that use become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts that come from learning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">God hath granted me to speak as I would, and to conceive as is meet for the things that are given me: because it is he that leadeth unto wisdom, and directeth the wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For in his hand are both we and our words; all wisdom also, and knowledge of workmanship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he hath given me certain knowledge of the things that are, namely, to know how the world was made, and the operation of the elements:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The beginning, ending, and midst of the times: the alterations of the turning of the sun, and the change of seasons:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The circuits of years, and the positions of stars:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The natures of living creatures, and the furies of wild beasts: the violence of winds, and the reasonings of men: the diversities of plants and the virtues of roots:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And all such things as are either secret or manifest, them I know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me: for in her is an understanding spirit holy, one only, manifold, subtil, lively, clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt, loving the thing that is good quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Kind to man, steadfast, sure, free from care, having all power, overseeing all things, and going through all understanding, pure, and most subtil, spirits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For wisdom is more moving than any motion: she passeth and goeth through all things by reason of her pureness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For after this cometh night: but vice shall not prevail against wisdom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">In that she is conversant with God, she magnifieth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself loved her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of his works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">If riches be a possession to be desired in this life; what is richer than wisdom, that worketh all things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And if prudence work; who of all that are is a more cunning workman than she?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude: which are such things, as en can have nothing more profitable in their life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If a man desire much experience, she knoweth things of old, and conjectureth aright what is to come: she knoweth the subtilties of speeches, and can expound dark sentences: she foreseeth signs and wonders, and the events of seasons and times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore I purposed to take her to me to live with me, knowing that she would be a counsellor of good things, and a comfort in cares and grief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For her sake I shall have estimation among the multitude, and honour with the elders, though I be young.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment, and shall be admired in the sight of great men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When I hold my tongue, they shall bide my leisure, and when I speak, they shall give good ear unto me: if I talk much, they shall lay their hands upon their mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Moreover by the means of her I shall obtain immortality, and leave behind me an everlasting memorial to them that come after me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I shall set the people in order, and the nations shall be subject unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Horrible tyrants shall be afraid, when they do but hear of me; I shall be found good among the multitude, and valiant in war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">After I am come into mine house, I will repose myself with her: for her conversation hath no bitterness; and to live with her hath no sorrow, but mirth and joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now when I considered these things in myself, and pondered them in my heart, how that to be allied unto wisdom is immortality;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And great pleasure it is to have her friendship; and in the works of her hands are infinite riches; and in the exercise of conference with her, prudence; and in talking with her, a good report; I went about seeking how to take her to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yea rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not otherwise obtain her, except God gave her me; and that was a point of wisdom also to know whose gift she was; I prayed unto the Lord, and besought him, and with my whole heart I said,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with thy word,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">For though a man be never so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount, and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance of the holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the world, and knew what was acceptable in thy sight, and right in thy commandments.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">For whose cause the earth being drowned with the flood, wisdom again preserved it, and directed the course of the righteous in a piece of wood of small value.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover, the nations in their wicked conspiracy being confounded, she found out the righteous, and preserved him blameless unto God, and kept him strong against his tender compassion toward his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the ungodly perished, she delivered the righteous man, who fled from the fire which fell down upon the five cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Of whose wickedness even to this day the waste land that smoketh is a testimony, and plants bearing fruit that never come to ripeness: and a standing pillar of salt is a monument of an unbelieving soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For regarding not wisdom, they gat not only this hurt, that they knew not the things which were good; but also left behind them to the world a memorial of their foolishness: so that in the things wherein they offended they could not so much as be hid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Rut wisdom delivered from pain those that attended upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When the righteous fled from his brother's wrath she guided him in right paths, shewed him the kingdom of God, and gave him knowledge of holy things, made him rich in his travels, and multiplied the fruit of his labours.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">When they were thirsty, they called upon thee, and water was given them out of the flinty rock, and their thirst was quenched out of the hard stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For by what things their enemies were punished, by the same they in their need were benefited.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For instead of of a perpetual running river troubled with foul blood,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Declaring by that thirst then how thou hadst punished their adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For when they were tried albeit but in mercy chastised, they knew how the ungodly were judged in wrath and tormented, thirsting in another manner than the just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For these thou didst admonish and try, as a father: but the other, as a severe king, thou didst condemn and punish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Whether they were absent or present, they were vexed alike.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Yea, and without these might they have fallen down with one blast, being persecuted of vengeance, and scattered abroad through the breath of thy power: but thou hast ordered all things in measure and number and weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For thou canst shew thy great strength at all times when thou wilt; and who may withstand the power of thine arm?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the whole world before thee is as a little grain of the balance, yea, as a drop of the morning dew that falleth down upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But thou hast mercy upon all; for thou canst do all things, and winkest at the sins of men, because they should amend.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">For it was a cursed seed from the beginning; neither didst thou for fear of any man give them pardon for those things wherein they sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For who shall say, What hast thou done? or who shall withstand thy judgment? or who shall accuse thee for the nations that perish, whom thou made? or who shall come to stand against thee, to be revenged for the unrighteous men?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">But by such works hast thou taught thy people that the just man should be merciful, and hast made thy children to be of a good hope that thou givest repentance for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, with such deliberation, giving them time and place, whereby they might be delivered from their malice:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">With how great circumspection didst thou judge thine own sons, unto whose fathers thou hast sworn, and made covenants of good promises?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore, whereas thou dost chasten us, thou scourgest our enemies a thousand times more, to the intent that, when we judge, we should carefully think of thy goodness, and when we ourselves are judged, we should look for mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Wherefore, whereas men have lived dissolutely and unrighteously, thou hast tormented them with their own abominations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For they went astray very far in the ways of error, and held them for gods, which even among the beasts of their enemies were despised, being deceived, as children of no understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore unto them, as to children without the use of reason, thou didst send a judgment to mock them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But they that would not be reformed by that correction, wherein he dallied with them, shall feel a judgment worthy of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For, look, for what things they grudged, when they were punished, that is, for them whom they thought to be gods; [now] being punished in them, when they saw it, they acknowledged him to be the true God, whom before they denied to know: and therefore came extreme damnation upon them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he, because he made it; and it, because, being corruptible, it was called god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alike hateful unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For that which is made shall be punished together with him that made it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there be a visitation: because in the creature of God they are become an abomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the devising of idols was the beginning of spiritual fornication, and the invention of them the corruption of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world, and therefore shall they come shortly to an end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away, now honoured him as a god, which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law, and graven images were worshipped by the commandments of kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they took the counterfeit of his visage from far, and made an express image of a king whom they honoured, to the end that by this their forwardness they might flatter him that was absent, as if he were present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to set forward the ignorant to more superstition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority, forced all his skill to make the resemblance of the best fashion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a god, which a little before was but honoured.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men, serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones and stocks the incommunicable name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred in the knowledge of God; but whereas they lived in the great war of ignorance, those so great plagues called they peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For whilst they slew their children in sacrifices, or used secret ceremonies, or made revellings of strange rites;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled: but either one slew another traiterously, or grieved him by adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So that there reigned in all men without exception blood, manslaughter, theft, and dissimulation, corruption, unfaithfulness, tumults, perjury,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Disquieting of good men, forgetfulness of good turns, defiling of souls, changing of kind, disorder in marriages, adultery, and shameless uncleanness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesy lies, or live unjustly, or else lightly forswear themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For insomuch as their trust is in idols, which have no life; though they swear falsely, yet they look not to be hurt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Howbeit for both causes shall they be justly punished: both because they thought not well of God, giving heed unto idols, and also unjustly swore in deceit, despising holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For it is not the power of them by whom they swear: but it is the just vengeance of sinners, that punisheth always the offence of the ungodly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But thou, O God, art gracious and true, longsuffering, and in mercy ordering all things,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy power: but we will not sin, knowing that we are counted thine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For to know thee is perfect righteousness: yea, to know thy power is the root of immortality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For neither did the mischievous invention of men deceive us, nor an image spotted with divers colours, the painter's fruitless labour;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The sight whereof enticeth fools to lust after it, and so they desire the form of a dead image, that hath no breath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Both they that make them, they that desire them, and they that worship them, are lovers of evil things, and are worthy to have such things to trust upon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the potter, tempering soft earth, fashioneth every vessel with much labour for our service: yea, of the same clay he maketh both the vessels that serve for clean uses, and likewise also all such as serve to the contrary: but what is the use of either sort, the potter himself is the judge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And employing his labours lewdly, he maketh a vain god of the same clay, even he which a little before was made of earth himself, and within a little while after returneth to the same, out when his life which was lent him shall be demanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Notwithstanding his care is, not that he shall have much labour, nor that his life is short: but striveth to excel goldsmiths and silversmiths, and endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass, and counteth it his glory to make counterfeit things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">His heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and his life of less value than clay:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and him that inspired into him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But they counted our life a pastime, and our time here a market for gain: for, say they, we must be getting every way, though it be by evil means.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For this man, that of earthly matter maketh brittle vessels and graven images, knoweth himself to offend above all others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And all the enemies of thy people, that hold them in subjection, are most foolish, and are more miserable than very babes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For they counted all the idols of the heathen to be gods: which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle; and as for their feet, they are slow to go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spirit fashioned them: but no man can make a god like unto himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For being mortal, he worketh a dead thing with wicked hands: for he himself is better than the things which he worshippeth: whereas he lived once, but they never.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yea, they worshipped those beasts also that are most hateful: for being compared together, some are worse than others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Neither are they beautiful, so much as to be desired in respect of beasts: but they went without the praise of God and his blessing.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore by the like were they punished worthily, and by the multitude of beasts tormented.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Instead of which punishment, dealing graciously with thine own people, thou preparedst for them meat of a strange taste, even quails to stir up their appetite:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">To the end that they, desiring food, might for the ugly sight of the beasts sent among them lothe even that, which they must needs desire; but these, suffering penury for a short space, might be made partakers of a strange taste.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it was requisite, that upon them exercising tyranny should come penury, which they could not avoid: but to these it should only be shewed how their enemies were tormented.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For when the horrible fierceness of beasts came upon these, and they perished with the stings of crooked serpents, thy wrath endured not for ever:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But they were troubled for a small season, that they might be admonished, having a sign of salvation, to put them in remembrance of the commandment of thy law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For he that turned himself toward it was not saved by the thing that he saw, but by thee, that art the Saviour of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And in this thou madest thine enemies confess, that it is thou who deliverest from all evil:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For them the bitings of grasshoppers and flies killed, neither was there found any remedy for their life: for they were worthy to be punished by such.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But thy sons not the very teeth of venomous dragons overcame: for thy mercy was ever by them, and healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For they were pricked, that they should remember thy words; and were quickly saved, that not falling into deep forgetfulness, they might be continually mindful of thy goodness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For it was neither herb, nor mollifying plaister, that restored them to health: but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For thou hast power of life and death: thou leadest to the gates of hell, and bringest up again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">A man indeed killeth through his malice: and the spirit, when it is gone forth, returneth not; neither the soul received up cometh again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But it is not possible to escape thine hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For the ungodly, that denied to know thee, were scourged by the strength of thine arm: with strange rains, hails, and showers, were they persecuted, that they could not avoid, and through fire were they consumed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For, which is most to be wondered at, the fire had more force in the water, that quencheth all things: for the world fighteth for the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For sometime the flame was mitigated, that it might not burn up the beasts that were sent against the ungodly; but themselves might see and perceive that they were persecuted with the judgment of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And at another time it burneth even in the midst of water above the power of fire, that it might destroy the fruits of an unjust land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Instead whereof thou feddest thine own people with angels' food, and didst send them from heaven bread prepared without their labour, able to content every man's delight, and agreeing to every taste.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For thy sustenance declared thy sweetness unto thy children, and serving to the appetite of the eater, tempered itself to every man's liking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But snow and ice endured the fire, and melted not, that they might know that fire burning in the hail, and sparkling in the rain, did destroy the fruits of the enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But this again did even forget his own strength, that the righteous might be nourished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For the creature that serveth thee, who art the Maker increaseth his strength against the unrighteous for their punishment, and abateth his strength for the benefit of such as put their trust in thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore even then was it altered into all fashions, and was obedient to thy grace, that nourisheth all things, according to the desire of them that had need:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">That thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovest, might know, that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth man: but that it is thy word, which preserveth them that put their trust in thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For that which was not destroyed of the fire, being warmed with a little sunbeam, soon melted away:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">That it might be known, that we must prevent the sun to give thee thanks, and at the dayspring pray unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For the hope of the unthankful shall melt away as the winter's hoar frost, and shall run away as unprofitable water.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For great are thy judgments, and cannot be expressed: therefore unnurtured souls have erred.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation; they being shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness, and fettered with the bonds of a long night, lay [there] exiled from the eternal providence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly astonished, and troubled with [strange] apparitions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For neither might the corner that held them keep them from fear: but noises [as of waters] falling down sounded about them, and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, very dreadful: for being much terrified, they thought the things which they saw to be worse than the sight they saw not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As for the illusions of art magick, they were put down, and their vaunting in wisdom was reproved with disgrace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of fear, worthy to be laughed at.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For though no terrible thing did fear them; yet being scared with beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, which could of no side be avoided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous, and being pressed with conscience, always forecasteth grievous things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succours which reason offereth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the expectation from within, being less, counteth the ignorance more than the cause which bringeth the torment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But they sleeping the same sleep that night, which was indeed intolerable, and which came upon them out of the bottoms of inevitable hell,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions, and partly fainted, their heart failing them: for a sudden fear, and not looked for, came upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept, shut up in a prison without iron bars,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer in the field, he was overtaken, and endured that necessity, which could not be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain of darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious noise of birds among the spreading branches, or a pleasing fall of water running violently,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Or a terrible sound of stones cast down, or a running that could not be seen of skipping beasts, or a roaring voice of most savage wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains; these things made them to swoon for fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the whole world shined with clear light, and none were hindered in their labour:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of that darkness which should afterward receive them: but yet were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Nevertheless thy saints had a very great light, whose voice they hearing, and not seeing their shape, because they also had not suffered the same things, they counted them happy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But for that they did not hurt them now, of whom they had been wronged before, they thanked them, and besought them pardon for that they had been enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Instead whereof thou gavest them a burning pillar of fire, both to be a guide of the unknown journey, and an harmless sun to entertain them honourably.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For they were worthy to be deprived of light and imprisoned in darkness, who had kept thy sons shut up, by whom the uncorrupt light of the law was to be given unto the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when they had determined to slay the babes of the saints, one child being cast forth, and saved, to reprove them, thou tookest away the multitude of their children, and destroyedst them altogether in a mighty water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Of that night were our fathers certified afore, that assuredly knowing unto what oaths they had given credence, they might afterwards be of good cheer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So of thy people was accepted both the salvation of the righteous, and destruction of the enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For wherewith thou didst punish our adversaries, by the same thou didst glorify us, whom thou hadst called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For the righteous children of good men did sacrifice secretly, and with one consent made a holy law, that the saints should be like partakers of the same good and evil, the fathers now singing out the songs of praise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the enemies, and a lamentable noise was carried abroad for children that were bewailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The master and the servant were punished after one manner; and like as the king, so suffered the common person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So they all together had innumerable dead with one kind of death; neither were the living sufficient to bury them: for in one moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For whereas they would not believe any thing by reason of the enchantments; upon the destruction of the firstborn, they acknowledged this people to be the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For while all things were in quiet silence, and that night was in the midst of her swift course,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Thine Almighty word leaped down from heaven out of thy royal throne, as a fierce man of war into the midst of a land of destruction,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And brought thine unfeigned commandment as a sharp sword, and standing up filled all things with death; and it touched the heaven, but it stood upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then suddenly visions of horrible dreams troubled them sore, and terrors came upon them unlooked for.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And one thrown here, and another there, half dead, shewed the cause of his death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the dreams that troubled them did foreshew this, lest they should perish, and not know why they were afflicted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yea, the tasting of death touched the righteous also, and there was a destruction of the multitude in the wilderness: but the wrath endured not long.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For then the blameless man made haste, and stood forth to defend them; and bringing the shield of his proper ministry, even prayer, and the propitiation of incense, set himself against the wrath, and so brought the calamity to an end, declaring that he was thy servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So he overcame the destroyer, not with strength of body, nor force of arms, but with a word subdued him that punished, alleging the oaths and covenants made with the fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For when the dead were now fallen down by heaps one upon another, standing between, he stayed the wrath, and parted the way to the living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For in the long garment was the whole world, and in the four rows of the stones was the glory of the fathers graven, and thy Majesty upon the daidem of his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Unto these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them: for it was enough that they only tasted of the wrath.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">As for the ungodly, wrath came upon them without mercy unto the end: for he knew before what they would do;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">How that having given them leave to depart, and sent them hastily away, they would repent and pursue them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For whilst they were yet mourning and making lamentation at the graves of the dead, they added another foolish device, and pursued them as fugitives, whom they had intreated to be gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For the destiny, whereof they were worthy, drew them unto this end, and made them forget the things that had already happened, that they might fulfil the punishment which was wanting to their torments:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And that thy people might pass a wonderful way: but they might find a strange death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the whole creature in his proper kind was fashioned again anew, serving the peculiar commandments that were given unto them, that thy children might be kept without hurt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As namely, a cloud shadowing the camp; and where water stood before, dry land appeared; and out of the Red sea a way without impediment; and out of the violent stream a green field:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherethrough all the people went that were defended with thy hand, seeing thy marvellous strange wonders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they went at large like horses, and leaped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For they were yet mindful of the things that were done while they sojourned in the strange land, how the ground brought forth flies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs instead of fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But afterwards they saw a new generation of fowls, when, being led with their appetite, they asked delicate meats.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For quails came up unto them from the sea for their contentment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And punishments came upon the sinners not without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behaviour toward strangers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And not only so, but peradventure some respect shall be had of those, because they used strangers not friendly:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But these very grievously afflicted them, whom they had received with feastings, and were already made partakers of the same laws with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore even with blindness were these stricken, as those were at the doors of the righteous man: when, being compassed about with horrible great darkness, every one sought the passage of his own doors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the elements were changed in themselves by a kind of harmony, like as in a psaltery notes change the name of the tune, and yet are always sounds; which may well be perceived by the sight of the things that have been done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For earthly things were turned into watery, and the things, that before swam in the water, now went upon the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The fire had power in the water, forgetting his own virtue: and the water forgat his own quenching nature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of the corruptible living things, though they walked therein; neither melted they the icy kind of heavenly meat that was of nature apt to melt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For in all things, O Lord, thou didst magnify thy people, and glorify them, neither didst thou lightly regard them: but didst assist them in every time and place.</VERS>
