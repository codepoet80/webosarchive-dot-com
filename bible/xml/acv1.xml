    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And God saw the light, that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear. And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And God called the dry land Earth, and he called the gathering together of the waters Seas. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind (in which is the seed of them) upon the earth. And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed according to their kind, and trees bearing fruit in which is the seed of it, according to their kind. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth. And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, also the stars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And God created the great sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth according to their kind. And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kind, and the cattle according to their kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And God said, Let us make mankind in our image-after our likeness-and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and female he created them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And God blessed them. And God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and have power over it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed. To you it shall be for food,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creeps upon the earth in which there is life, for food-every green herb. And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up, for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth. And there was not a man to till the ground,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of the ground Jehovah God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, also the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it was divided, and became four heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of the first is Pishon. That is it which encompasses the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the gold of that land is good. There is bdellium and the onyx stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the name of the second river is Gihon. The same is it which encompasses the whole land of Cush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the name of the third river is Hiddekel. That is it which goes in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou may freely eat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shall not eat of it. For in the day that thou eat of it thou shall surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone, I will make a help meet for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and whatever the man called every living creature, that was the name of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field, but for man there was not found a help meet for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept. And God took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in place of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, he made a woman, and brought her to the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cling to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said to the woman, Yea, has God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the woman said to the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For God knows that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make wise, she took of the fruit of it, and ate. And she also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jehovah God called to the man, and said to him, Where are thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. And I hid myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said, Who told thee that thou was naked? Have thou eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee that thou should not eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the man said, The woman whom thou gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Jehovah God said to the woman, What is this thou have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jehovah God said to the serpent, Because thou have done this, cursed are thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. Upon thy belly thou shall go, and dust thou shall eat all the days of thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. He shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy childbearing, in pain thou shall bring forth children. And thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And to Adam he said, Because thou have hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shall not eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy sake. In toil thou shall eat of it all the days of thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Also, thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to thee, and thou shall eat the herb of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In the sweat of thy face thou shall eat bread, till thou return to the ground, for out of it thou were taken. For thou are dust, and to dust thou shall return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil, and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from where he was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So he drove out the man. And he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And again she bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought an offering to Jehovah of the fruit of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat of it. And Jehovah had respect to Abel and to his offering,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but he did not have respect to Cain and to his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jehovah said to Cain, Why are thou angry? And why has thy countenance fallen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If thou do well, shall thou not be accepted? And if thou do not well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire shall be for thee, and thou shall rule over it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, What have thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood cries to me from the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now cursed are thou from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When thou till the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength. A fugitive and a wanderer thou shall be on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, thou have driven me out this day from the face of the ground, and I shall be hid from thy face, and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. And it shall come to pass, that whoever finds me shall slay me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jehovah said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any who finds him should smite him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch. And Cain built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Lamech took to him two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And his brother's name was Jubal. He was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech. For I have killed a man for wounding me, and a young man for bruising me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If Cain shall be avenged seven fold, truly Lamech seventy-seven fold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth. For, she said, God has appointed for me another seed instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And to Seth, to him also there was born a son, and he called his name Enosh. Then men began to call upon the name of Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God he made him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and called his name Seth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="43">And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and donkeys.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="31">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father's, and he has gotten all this glory of that which was our father's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jehovah said to Jacob, Return to the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime, but the God of my father has been with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God did not allow him to hurt me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages, then all the flock bore speckled, and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages, then all the flock bore ringstreaked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the agent of God said to me in the dream, Jacob. And I said, Here I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointed a pillar, where thou vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get thee out from this land, and return to the land of thy nativity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's. Now then, whatever God has said to thee, do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father to the land of Canaan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jacob slipped away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So he fled with all that he had. And he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he took his brothers with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey, and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said to him, Take heed to thyself that thou not speak to Jacob either good or bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain. And Laban encamped with his brothers in the mountain of Gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Laban said to Jacob, What have thou done, that thou have slipped away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Why did thou flee secretly, and creep away from me, and did not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now thou have done foolishly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">It is in the power of my hand to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou not speak to Jacob either good or bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And now, though thou have certainly gone, because thou have been very desirous for thy father's house, yet why have thou stolen my gods?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I said, Lest thou should take thy daughters from me by force.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">With whomever thou find thy gods, he shall not live. Before our brothers discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt around all the tent, but did not find them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee, for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but did not find the teraphim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Jacob was angry, and chided with Laban. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? What is my sin that thou have hotly pursued after me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Whereas thou have felt around all my stuff, what have thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brothers and thy brothers, that they may judge between us two.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">These twenty years I have been with thee, thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and I have not eaten the rams of thy flocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">I did not bring to thee that which was torn by beasts; I bore the loss of it, of my hand thou required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">These twenty years I have been in thy house. I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock. And thou have changed my wages ten times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now thou would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee last night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou see is mine. And what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their sons whom they have borne?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou, and let it be for a witness between me and thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones, and they took stones, and made a heap. And they ate there by the heap.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore the name of it was called Galeed,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="50">if thou will afflict my daughters, and if thou will take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us, see, God is witness between me and thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set between me and thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">This heap is witness, and the pillar is witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shall not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="32">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jacob went on his way, and the agents of God met him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say to my lord Esau, Thus says thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I have oxen, and donkeys, flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants. And I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he comes to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. And he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said, If Esau comes to the one company, and smites it, then the company which is left shall escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who said to me, Return to thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou have shown to thy servant, for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two companies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau. For I fear him, lest he comes and smites me, the mother with the sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And thou said, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-donkeys and ten foals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets thee, and asks thee, saying, Whose are thou? And where do thou go? And whose are these before thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then thou shall say, Thy servant Jacob's. It is a present sent to my lord Esau. And, behold, he also is behind us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all who followed the herds, saying, On this manner shall ye speak to Esau when ye find him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So the present passed over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the company.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when he saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained as he wrestled with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let thee go unless thou bless me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he said, Thy name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel, for thou have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Why is it that thou ask for my name? And he blessed him there.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Therefore the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God has graciously given thy servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. And afterward Joseph came near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said, What do thou mean by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Esau said, I have enough, my brother, let that which thou have be thine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jacob said, No, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand, inasmuch as I have seen thy face, as any man would see the face of God, and thou were pleased with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">See, because Jehovah has given you the sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Abide ye every man in his place. Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So the people rested on the seventh day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the house of Israel called the name of it Manna. And it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers with honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded. Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna in it, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to the commandment of Jehovah, and encamped in Rephidim. And there was no water for the people to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why do ye contend with me? Why do ye challenge Jehovah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the people thirsted there for water. And the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why have thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our sons and our cattle with thirst?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do to this people? They are almost ready to stone me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jehovah said to Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee from the elders of Israel, and thy rod, with which thou smote the river, take in thy hand, and go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb, and thou shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the contending of the sons of Israel, and because they challenged Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us, or not?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed, and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Moses' hands were heavy. And they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. And his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Joshua weakened Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor. And I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Moses' father-in-law said to him, The thing that thou do is not good.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Moses went up to God. And Jehovah called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus thou shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the sons of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be my own possession from among all peoples, for all the earth is mine,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah has spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jehovah said to Moses, Lo, I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee forever. And Moses told the words of the people to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and be ready for the third day, for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people, and they washed their garments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day. Come not near a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of an exceedingly loud trumpet. And all the people who were in the camp trembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the lower part of the mount.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire, and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace. And the whole mount quaked greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the voice of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jehovah came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount. And Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount, and Moses went up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jehovah said to Moses, Go down, command the people, lest they break through to Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And let the priests also, who come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth upon them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Jehovah thy God, he will go over before thee. He will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shall dispossess them. Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as Jehovah has spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jehovah will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, whom he destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jehovah will deliver them up before you, and ye shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be frightened at them, for Jehovah thy God, he it is who goes with thee. He will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage. For thou shall go with this people into the land which Jehovah has sworn to their fathers to give them, and thou shall cause them to inherit it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jehovah, he it is who goes before thee. He will be with thee. He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Fear not, neither be dismayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and to all the elders of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">when all Israel has come to appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they have turned to other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the sons of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the sons of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat, then they will turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness, for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed.

      <VERS vnumber="4">The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice, a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They have dealt corruptly with him. They are not his sons, it is their blemish, a perverse and crooked generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Do ye thus requite Jehovah, O foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy father who has bought thee? He has made thee, and established thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Remember the days of old. Consider the years of many generations. Ask thy father, and he will show thee, thine elders, and they will tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of men, he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For Jehovah's portion is his people. Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness. He compassed him about. He cared for him. He kept him as the apple of his eye.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Jehovah alone led him, and there was no foreign god with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He made him ride on the high places of the earth, and he ate the increase of the field, and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked. Thou have grown fat. Thou have grown thick. Thou have become sleek. Then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They moved him to jealousy with strange gods. With abominations they provoked him to anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They sacrificed to demons, not God, to gods that they knew not, to new gods that came up of late, which your fathers did not dread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thou are unmindful of the Rock that begot thee, and have forgotten God who gave thee birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Jehovah saw, and abhorred, because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight unless their Rock had sold them, and Jehovah had delivered them up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan to the fords, and as soon as those who pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And before they were laid down, she came up to them upon the roof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she said to the men, I know that Jehovah has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us. And that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when ye came out of Egypt, and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man because of you, for Jehovah your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a true token,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Then she let them down by a cord through the window, for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And she said to them, Get you to the mountain lest the pursuers come upon you. And hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned, and afterward ye may go your way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the men said to her, We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou have made us to swear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Behold, when we come into the land, thou shall bind this line of scarlet cord in the window which thou let us down by. And thou shall gather to thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brothers, and all thy father's household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless. And whoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But if thou utter this our business, then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou have made us to swear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet line in the window.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they went, and came to the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned. And the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but did not find them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun. And they told him all that had befallen them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they said to Joshua, Truly Jehovah has delivered into our hands all the land, and moreover all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the sons of Israel until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the sons of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make for thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Joshua made him knives of flint, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised: All the people who came forth out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way after they came forth out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For all the people who came out were circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the nation, even the men of war who came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, to whom Jehovah swore that he would not let them see the land which Jehovah swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And their sons, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were recovered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the sons of Israel encamped in Gilgal. And they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they ate of the produce of the land on the morrow after the Passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, in the selfsame day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. Neither had the sons of Israel manna any more, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are thou for us, or for our adversaries?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, No, but as captain of the army of Jehovah I have now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, What does my lord say to his servant?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the captain of Jehovah's army said to Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou stand is holy. And Joshua did so.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Jericho was shut up tight because of the sons of Israel. None went out, and none came in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jehovah said to Joshua, See, I have given Jericho into thy hand, and the king of it, and the mighty men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And ye shall encompass the city, all the men of war, going around the city once. Thus shall thou do six days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. And the seventh day ye shall encompass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout. And the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they said to the people, Pass on, and encompass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before Jehovah passed on, and blew the trumpets. And the ark of the covenant of Jehovah followed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rearward went behind the ark, the priests blowing the trumpets as they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout. Then ye shall shout.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So he caused the ark of Jehovah to encompass the city, going around it once. And they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Jehovah went on continually, and blew the trumpets. And the armed men went before them, and the rearward came behind the ark of Jehovah, the priests blowing the trumpets as they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the second day they encompassed the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and encompassed the city according to the same manner seven times. Only on that day they encompassed the city seven times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout, for Jehovah has given you the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the city shall be set apart, even it and all that is in it, to Jehovah. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But as for you, only keep yourselves from what is set apart, lest when ye have set it apart, ye take from what is set apart. So ye would make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy to Jehovah. They shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets. And it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out from there the woman, and all that she has, as ye swore to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the young men, the spies, went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all her kindred, and they set them outside the camp of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Joshua saved alive Rahab the harlot, and her father's household, and all that she had. And she dwelt in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah who rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn he shall lay the foundation of it, and with the loss of his youngest son he shall set up the gates of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So Jehovah was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But the sons of Israel committed a trespass in what was set apart. For Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took from what was set apart, and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the sons of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai. Do not make all the people to toil there, for they are but few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So there went up there of the people about three thousand men. And they fled before the men of Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty-six men. And they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and they put dust upon their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Joshua said, Alas, O lord Jehovah, why have thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? Would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Oh, Lord, what shall I say after Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will encompass us around, and cut off our name from the earth, and what will thou do for thy great name?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jehovah said to Joshua, Get thee up. Why are thou thus fallen upon thy face?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Israel has sinned. Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even taken from what was set apart, and have also stolen, and also dissembled. And they have even put it among their own stuff.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore the sons of Israel cannot stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies because they have become accursed. I will not be with you any more unless ye destroy what was set apart from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow. For thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, There is what has been set apart in the midst of thee, O Israel. Thou cannot stand before thine enemies until ye take away the devoted thing from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes, and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah takes shall come near by families, and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near by households, and the household which Jehovah shall take shall come near man by man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he has wrought folly in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he brought near the family of Judah, and he took the family of the Zerahites. And he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he brought near his household man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and make confession to him, and tell me now what thou have done. Hide it not from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonian mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them. And, behold, they are hid in the ground in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. And, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the sons of Israel, and they laid them down before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Joshua said, Why have thou troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they raised over him a great heap of stones, to this day, and Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called the valley of Achor to this day.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehovah said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed. Take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And thou shall do to Ai and its king as thou did to Jericho and its king. Only the spoil of it, and the cattle of it, ye shall take for a prey to yourselves. Set thee an ambush for the city behind it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and I, and all the people that are with me, will approach to the city. And it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first. So we will flee before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city, for Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire. According to the word of Jehovah shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Joshua sent them forth, and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai, but Joshua lodged that night among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And all the people, even the men of war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt beyond the Jordan. And they fought with you. And I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land, and I destroyed them from before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. And he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And I gave you a land in which thou had not labored, and cities which ye did not build, and ye dwell in it. Ye eat of vineyards and oliveyards which ye did not plant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now therefore fear Jehovah, and serve him in sincerity and in truth. And put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve ye Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And if it seems evil to you to serve Jehovah, choose you this day whom ye will serve: whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that we should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Jehovah our God, he it is who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jehovah drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who dwelt in the land. Therefore we also will serve Jehovah, for he is our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Joshua said to the people, Ye cannot serve Jehovah, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God. He will not forgive your transgression nor your sins.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And the people said to Joshua, No, but we will serve Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Joshua said to the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen for you, Jehovah, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now therefore, he said, put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the people said to Joshua, we will serve Jehovah our God, and we will hearken to his voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God. And he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And they buried the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up out of Egypt, in Sicima, in the portion of the land which Jacob bought from the Amorites who dwelt in Sicima for a hundred ewe-lambs. And he gave it to Joseph for a portion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Eleazar the son of Aaron died. And they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill-country of Ephraim.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass, when the agent of Jehovah spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they called the name of that place Bochim, and they sacrificed there to Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves down to them. And they provoked Jehovah to anger.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiled them. And he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Wherever they went out, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had spoken, and as Jehovah had sworn to them. And they were exceedingly distressed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jehovah raised up judges who saved them out of the hand of those who despoiled them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And yet they did not hearken to their judges, for they played the harlot after other gods, and bowed themselves down to them. They turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Jehovah. They did not do so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when Jehovah raised up judges for them, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For Jehovah regretted because of their groaning because of those who oppressed them and vexed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them. They did not cease from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he said, Because this nation has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not hearkened to my voice,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And the sons of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah. And Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And the sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when the sons of Israel cried to Jehovah, Jehovah raised up for them a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. And the sons of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Now when he was gone out, his servants came, and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked. And they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people who are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand has saved me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty-two thousand, and there remained ten thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people are yet too many. Bring them down to the water, and I will try them for thee there. And it shall be, that of whom I say to thee, This man shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee, and of whomever I say to thee, This man shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he brought down the people to the water. And Jehovah said to Gideon, Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him thou shall set by himself. Likewise everyone who bows down upon his knees to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men, but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jehovah said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped I will save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand. And let all the people go every man to his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the people took provision in their hand, and their trumpets. And he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men. And the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said to him, Arise, get thee down into the camp, for I have delivered it into thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And thou shall hear what they say, and afterward thy hands shall be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude, and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when Gideon came, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow. And he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream. And, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and smote it so that it fell, and turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else except the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. Into his hand God has delivered Midian, and all the army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation of it, that he worshiped. And he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise, for Jehovah has delivered the army of Midian into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put trumpets into the hands of all of them, and empty pitchers, with torches inside the pitchers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise, and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so ye shall do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So Gideon, and the hundred men who were with him, came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch when they had but newly set the watch. And they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow. And they cried out, The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they stood every man in his place round about the camp. And all the army ran, and they shouted, and put them to flight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and Jehovah set every man's sword against his fellow, and against all the army. And the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian. And they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">God has delivered into your hand the rulers of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the rulers of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand that we should give bread to thine army?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued after them. And he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him. And he described for him the rulers of Succoth, and the elders of it, seventy-seven men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye taunted me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy men who are weary?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye killed at Tabor? And they answered, As thou are, so were they. Each one resembled the sons of a king.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew a sword. All these were men of war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the sons of Israel arose, and went up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God. And they said, Who shall go up for us first to battle against the sons of Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Judah first.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin. And the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the sons of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty-two thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the sons of Israel went up and wept before Jehovah until evening. And they asked of Jehovah, saying, Shall I again draw near to battle against the sons of Benjamin my brother? And Jehovah said, Go up against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the sons of Israel came near against the sons of Benjamin the second day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the sons of Israel again eighteen thousand men. All these drew the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then all the sons of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before Jehovah, and fasted that day until evening, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the sons of Israel asked of Jehovah (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver him into thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Israel set an ambushment against Gibeah round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the sons of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city. And they began to smite and kill of the people as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah, in the field about thirty men of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the sons of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us as at the first. But the sons of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar, and the ambushment of Israel broke forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And there came opposite Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe, but they knew not that evil was close upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Jehovah smote Benjamin before Israel, and the sons of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand and a hundred men. All these drew the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were smitten, for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin because they trusted to the ambushment whom they had set against Gibeah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the ambushment hastened, and rushed upon Gibeah. And the ambushment drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushment was, that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons, for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that evil had come upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness. But the battle followed hard after them, and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">They enclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trod them down at their resting-place, as far as opposite Gibeah toward the sunrise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men. All these were men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. And they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and smote of them two thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword. All these were men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And the men of Israel turned again upon the sons of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the cattle, and all that they found. Moreover they set on fire all the cities which they found.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left, and her two sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they took wives for them of the women of Moab. The name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth, and they dwelt there about ten years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Mahlon and Chilion died, both of them, and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people in giving them bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother's house. Jehovah deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jehovah grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices, and wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they said to her, No, but we will return with thee to thy people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters. Why will ye go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Turn again, my daughters. Go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope. If I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">would ye therefore delay till they were grown? Would ye therefore stay from having husbands? No, my daughters, for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of Jehovah has gone forth against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they lifted up their voices, and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law has gone back to her people, and to her god. Return thou after thy sister-in-law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee, for where thou go, I will go, and where thou lodge, I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So those two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they came to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and the women said, Is this Naomi?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And she said to them, Call me not Naomi. Call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I went out full, and Jehovah has brought me home again empty. Why do ye call me Naomi, seeing Jehovah has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And her chance was to land on the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they answered him, Jehovah bless thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the servant who was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabite damsel who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather behind the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she tarried a little in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Boaz said to Ruth, Do thou not hear, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from here, but abide here close by my maidens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let thine eyes be on the field that they reap, and go thou after them. Have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? And when thou are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in thy sight that thou should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Boaz answered and said to her, It has been fully shown me all that thou have done to thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband, and how thou have left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and have come to a people that thou knew not formerly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jehovah recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou have come to take refuge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, because thou have comforted me, and because thou have spoken kindly to thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And at mealtime Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when she arose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and do not rebuke her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So she gleaned in the field until evening. And she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And she took it up, and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. And she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was satisfied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And her mother-in-law said to her, Where have thou gleaned today? And where have thou worked? Blessed be he who took knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to us, one of our near kinsmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, Thou shall keep close by my young men until they have ended all my harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that they not meet thee in any other field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So she kept close by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest. And she dwelt with her mother-in-law.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor. But do not make thyself known to the man until he shall have done eating and drinking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it shall be, when he lies down, that thou shall notice the place where he shall lie. And thou shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lie thee down. And he will tell thee what thou shall do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And she said to her, All that thou say I will do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And she went down to the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. And she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was startled, and turned himself, and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said, Who are thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thy handmaid. Spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid, for thou are a near kinsman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, Blessed be thou of Jehovah, my daughter. Thou have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou did not follow young men, whether poor or rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now, my daughter, fear not. I will do to thee all that thou say, for all the city of my people know that thou are a worthy woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And now it is true that I am a near kinsman. However there is a kinsman nearer than I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Remain this night, and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform to thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part. But if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then I will do the part of a kinsman to thee, as Jehovah lives. Lie down until the morning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And she lay at his feet until the morning. And she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said, Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it. And she held it, and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her, and he went into the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And she said, He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then she said, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall, for the man will not rest until he has finished the thing this day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there. And, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by, to whom he said, Such man, stay, turn aside. Sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come again out of the country of Moab, sells the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I thought to disclose it to thee, saying, Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou will redeem it, redeem it, but if thou will not redeem it, then tell me that I may know, for there is none to redeem it besides thee, and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Boaz said, That day thou buy the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the near kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself lest I mar my own inheritance. Take thou my right of redemption on thee, for I cannot redeem it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: A man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor. And this was the manner of attestation in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for thyself. And he drew off his shoe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, from the hand of Naomi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place. Ye are witnesses this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And all the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Jehovah make the woman that has come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel, and do thou worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And let thy house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Jehovah shall give thee by this young woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and Jehovah gave her conception, and she bore a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be Jehovah, who has not left thee this day without a near kinsman. And let his name be famous in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he shall be to thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age, for thy daughter-in-law, who loves thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, has borne him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the women, her neighbors, gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi. And they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill-country of Ephraim. And his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Jehovah, were there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but to Hannah he gave a double portion, for he loved Hannah, but Jehovah had shut up her womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And her rival provoked her greatly, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she provoked her. Therefore she wept, and did not eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why do thou weep? And why do thou not eat? And why is thy heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten sons?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Jehovah, and wept much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou will indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but will give to thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli noticed her mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Eli said to her, How long will thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Count not thy handmaid for an iniquitous woman, for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou have asked of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And she said, Let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and ate, and her countenance was no more sad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and Jehovah remembered her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it came to pass, when the time came about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son. And she called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, Not until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and abide there forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems good to thee. Remain until thou have weaned him, only Jehovah establish his word. So the woman remained and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of Jehovah in Shiloh, and the child was young.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they killed the bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by thee here, praying to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I prayed for this child, and Jehovah has given me my petition which I asked of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore also I have granted him to Jehovah; as long as he lives he is granted to Jehovah. And he worshiped Jehovah there.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart exults in Jehovah. My horn is exalted in Jehovah. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There is none holy as Jehovah, for there is none besides thee, neither is there any rock like our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Talk no more so very proudly. Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth, for Jehovah is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The bows of the mighty men are broken, and those who stumbled are girded with strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Those who were full have hired out themselves for bread, and those who were hungry have ceased to hunger. Yea, the barren has borne seven, and she who has many sons languishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jehovah kills, and makes alive. He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jehovah makes poor, and makes rich. He brings low, he also lifts up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He raises up the poor out of the dust, he lifts up the needy from the dunghill, to make them sit with rulers, and inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he has set the world upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness, for by strength no man shall prevail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Those who strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces. He will thunder against them in heaven. Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth, and he will give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house, and the child ministered to Jehovah before Eli the priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot. All that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took with it. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, for he will not have boiled flesh from thee, but raw.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And if the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desires, then he would say, No, but thou shall give it to me now, and if not, I will take it by force.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah, for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But Samuel ministered before Jehovah, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed by this woman for the petition which was asked of Jehovah. And they went to their own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now Eli was very old. And he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said to them, Why do ye such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">No, my sons, for it is no good report that I hear. Ye make Jehovah's people to transgress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">If one man sins against another, God shall judge him, but if a man sins against Jehovah, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they did not hearken to the voice of their father, because Jehovah intended to kill them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Jehovah, and also with men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Did I reveal myself to the house of thy father when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? And did I give to the house of thy father all the offerings of the sons of Israel made by fire?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Why do ye kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chief of all the offerings of Israel my people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me forever, but now Jehovah says, Be it far from me, for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And thou shall see an enemy in my habitation, in all that I shall give Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy house forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart. And all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And this shall be the sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: In one day they shall die, both of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And I will raise up for me a faithful priest who shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. And I will build for him a sure house, and he shall walk before my anointed forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And it shall come to pass, that everyone who is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices that I may eat a morsel of bread.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the child Samuel served Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim so that he could not see),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down in the temple of Jehovah where the ark of God was,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">that Jehovah called Samuel. And he said, Here I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he ran to Eli, and said, Here I am, for thou called me. And he said, I did not call. Lie down again. And he went and lay down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here I am, for thou called me. And he answered, I did not call, my son. Lie down again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here I am, for thou called me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down, and it shall be, if he calls thee, that thou shall say, Speak, Jehovah, for thy servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant hears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse upon themselves, and he did not restrain them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel was afraid to show Eli the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said, What is the thing that Jehovah has spoken to thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me. God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah. Let him do what seems him good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh, for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. And when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has Jehovah smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sits above the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What is the meaning of the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah came into the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God has come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing heretofore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Be strong, and strengthen yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Conduct yourselves like men, and fight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent. And there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with dirt upon his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What does the noise of this tumult mean? And the man hastened, and came and told Eli.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the man said to Eli, I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. And he said, How did the matter go, my son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he who brought the news answered and said, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people. And thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate. And his neck broke, and he died, for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered. And when she heard the news that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth, for her pains came upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, Fear not, for thou have brought forth a son. But she did not answer, neither did she regard it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And she said, The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God is taken.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when those of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they arose early on the morning of the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah, and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold. Only the stump of Dagon was left to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us, for his hand is hard upon us, and upon Dagon our god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of Jehovah was against the city with a very great discomfiture. And he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and tumors broke out upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people. For there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the men who did not die were smitten with the tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the ark of Jehovah was in the country of the Philistines seven months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Philistines called for the priests and the psychics, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah? Show us with what we shall sent it to its place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return for him a trespass offering. Then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then they said, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? And they said, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore ye shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land. And ye shall give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Why then do ye harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore take and prepare for you a new cart, and two milk cows on which there has come no yoke. And tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And take the ark of Jehovah, and lay it upon the cart. And put the jewels of gold, which ye return to him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side of it, and send it away, that it may go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And watch. If it goes up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then he has done to us this great evil, but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the men did so, and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they put the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the cows took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh. They went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. And the lords of the Philistines went behind them to the border of Beth-shemesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And those of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. And they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there where there was a great stone. And they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer that was with it, in which the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone. And the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to Jehovah: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even to the great stone on which they set down the ark of Jehovah, which stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of Jehovah. He smote of the people fifty thousand and seventy men. And the people mourned, because Jehovah had smitten the people with a great slaughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God? And to whom shall he go up from us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Jehovah. Come ye down, and fetch it up to you.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Jehovah, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it came to pass, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim, that the time was long, for it was twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return to Jehovah with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts to Jehovah, and serve him only. And he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the sons of Israel did put away the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, and served Jehovah only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel judged the sons of Israel in Mizpah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the sons of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the sons of Israel said to Samuel, Do not cease to cry to Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he had a son whose name was Saul, a young man and fine looking. And there was not among the sons of Israel a man better looking than he. From his shoulders and upward he was taller than any of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the donkeys.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there. And he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father leave off caring for the donkeys, and be anxious for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said to him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in honor. All that he says comes surely to pass. Now let us go there, perhaps he can tell us concerning our journey on which we go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Saul said to his servant, But behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God. What have we?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer, for he who is now called a Prophet was formerly called a Seer.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Saul said to his servant, Well said. Come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they answered them, and said, He is. Behold, he is before thee. Make haste now, for he has come today into the city, for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As soon as ye have come into the city, ye shall straightaway find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the sacrifice, and afterwards those who are bidden eat. Now therefore get you up, for at this time ye shall find him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they went up to the city. And as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now Jehovah had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Tomorrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. And he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines, for I have looked upon my people, because their cry has come to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said to him, Behold, the man of whom I spoke to thee! This man shall have authority over my people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for ye shall eat with me today. And in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And as for thy donkeys that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them, for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for all thy father's house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Saul answered and said, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then speak thou to me according to this manner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chief place among those who were bidden, who were about thirty men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said to thee, Set it by thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold, that which has been reserved! Set it before thee and eat, because it has been kept for thee to the appointed time, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they came down from the high place into the city, he conversed with Saul upon the housetop.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they arose early. And it came to pass about the dawning of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand thou still first, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">

      <VERS vnumber="2">When thou are departed from me today, then thou shall find two men by Rachel's sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah. And they will say to thee, The donkeys which thou went to seek are found, and, lo, thy father has left off caring for the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then thou shall go on forward from there, and thou shall come to the oak of Tabor. And there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread, which thou shall receive from their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">After that thou shall come to the hill of God where is the garrison of the Philistines. And it shall come to pass, when thou have come there to the city, that thou shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them, and they will be prophesying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the Spirit of Jehovah will come mightily upon thee, and thou shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And let it be, when these signs have come to thee, that thou do as occasion shall serve thee, for God is with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And thou shall go down before me to Gilgal. And, behold, I will come down to thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings. Thou shall tarry seven days till I come to thee, and show thee what thou shall do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it was so, that, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart. And all those signs came to pass that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him. And the Spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass, when all who knew him formerly saw, that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And a man from the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Where did ye go? And he said, To seek the donkeys, and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he did not tell him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Samuel called the people together to Jehovah to Mizpah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said to the sons of Israel, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families, and the family of the Matrites was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken. But when they sought him, he could not be found.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore they asked of Jehovah further, Is there yet a man to come here? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he has hid himself among the baggage.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it fell upon a day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison that is on yonder side. But he did not tell his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Saul abode in the outermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron. And the people who were with him were about six hundred men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Jehovah in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan was gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side. And the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that Jehovah will work for us, for there is no limitation to Jehovah to save by many or by few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And his armor bearer said to him, Do all that is in thy heart. Turn thee, behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Jonathan said, Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will disclose ourselves to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If they say thus to us, Tarry until we come to you, then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if they say thus, Come up to us, then we will go up, for Jehovah has delivered them into our hand, and this shall be the sign to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And both of them disclosed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armor bearer, Come up after me, for Jehovah has delivered them into the hand of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armor bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer killed them after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled. And the earth quaked, so there was an exceedingly great trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went here and there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Saul said to the people who were with him, Number now, and see who has gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Saul said to Ahijah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was there at that time with the sons of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it came to pass, while Saul talked to the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased. And Saul said to the priest, Withdraw thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle. And, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as formerly, and who went up with them into the camp, from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed close after them in the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So Jehovah saved Israel that day, and the battle passed over by Beth-aven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the men of Israel were distressed that day, for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man who eats any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all the people came into the forest, and there was honey upon the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the people came to the forest, behold, the honey dropped, but no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath, therefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were enlightened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then one of the people answered, and said, Thy father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man who eats food this day, and the people were faint.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Jonathan said, My father has troubled the land. See, I pray you, how my eyes have been enlightened because I tasted a little of this honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? For now there has been no great slaughter among the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">and the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and killed them on the ground. And the people ate them with the blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, ye have dealt treacherously. Roll a great stone to me this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat. And sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and killed them there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Saul built an altar to Jehovah; the same was the first altar that he built to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seems good to thee. Then the priest said, Let us draw near here to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he did not answer him that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Saul said, Draw near here, all ye chiefs of the people, and know and see how this sin has been this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For, as Jehovah lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then he said to all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what seems good to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Therefore Saul said to Jehovah, the God of Israel, Show the right. And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, but the people escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou have done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand. And, lo, I must die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And Saul said, God do so and more also, for thou shall surely die, Jonathan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it. As Jehovah lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he did not die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then Saul went up from following the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the sons of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. And wherever he turned himself, he put them to the worse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua. And the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And there was great war against the Philistines all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Samuel said to Saul, Jehovah sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel. Now therefore hearken thou to the voice of the words of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I have remembered that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way when he came up out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not, but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them, for ye showed kindness to all the sons of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou go to Shur, that is before Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. But everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the word of Jehovah came to Samuel, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I regret that I have set up Saul to be king, for he has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And Samuel was angry, and he cried out to Jehovah all night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set up for him a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Samuel came to Saul. And Saul said to him, Blessed be thou of Jehovah. I have performed the commandment of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Samuel said, What then means this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God, and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Samuel said to Saul, Stop, and I will tell thee what Jehovah has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Samuel said, Though thou were little in thine own sight, were thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jehovah sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Why then did thou not obey the voice of Jehovah, but did fly upon the spoil, and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Samuel said, Has Jehovah as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou have rejected the word of Jehovah, he has also rejected thee from being king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me that I may worship Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with thee, for thou have rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected thee from being king over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as Samuel turned about to go away, Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it tore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Samuel said to him, Jehovah has torn the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and has given it to a neighbor of thine, who is better than thou.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent, for he is not a man that he should repent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then he said, I have sinned. Yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So Samuel turned again after Saul, and Saul worshiped Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then Samuel said, Bring ye here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Samuel said, As thy sword has made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death, for Samuel mourned for Saul, and Jehovah regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehovah said to Samuel, How long will thou mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill thy horn with oil, and go. I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for me a king among his sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Samuel said, How do I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shall do. And thou shall anoint to me him whom I name to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Samuel did that which Jehovah spoke, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Do thou come peaceably?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said, Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, when they came, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah's anointed is before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Jehovah said to Samuel, Do not look on his countenance, or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For Jehovah sees not as man sees, for man looks on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looks on the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, Jehovah has not chosen these men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Samuel said to Jesse, Are all thy sons here? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him, for we will not sit down till he comes here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and of a beautiful countenance, and fine to look upon. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him, for this is he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubles thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let our lord now command thy servants, who are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp. And it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shall be well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Saul said to his servants, Provide for me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then one of the young men answered, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely man, and Jehovah is with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send to me David thy son, who is with the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jesse took a donkey with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And David came to Saul, and stood before him. And he loved him greatly, and he became his armor bearer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass, when the spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand. So Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Philistines gathered their armies together to battle. And they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, and there was a valley between them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail. And the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron. And his shield-bearer went before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he stood and cried out to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why have ye come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? Choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If he is able to fight with me, and kill me, then we will be your servants, but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then ye shall be our servants, and serve us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day. Give me a man, that we may fight together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem-judah, whose name was Jesse. And he had eight sons, and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken in years among men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David was the youngest, and the three eldest followed Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for thy brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to thy brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand. And look how thy brothers fare, and take their pledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the place of the wagons as the army which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and saluted his brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words, and David heard them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were greatly afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man who has come up? Surely to defy Israel he has come up. And it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that kills him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. And Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why have thou come down? And with whom have thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the mischief of thy heart, for thou have come down that thou might see the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner, and the people answered him again after the former manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when the words were heard which David spoke, they repeated them before Saul, and he sent for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him. Thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Saul said to David, Thou are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for thou are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And David said to Saul, Thy servant was keeping his father's sheep, and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth. And when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And David said, Jehovah who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and Jehovah shall be with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he attempted to go, for he had not tested them. And David said to Saul, I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them. And David put them off of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he took his staff in his hand, and chose for him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his wallet. And his sling was in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And the Philistine came on and drew near to David, and the man who bore the shield went before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that thou come to me with sticks? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then David said to the Philistine, Thou come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin, but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou have defied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">This day Jehovah will deliver thee into my hand, and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee. And I will give the dead bodies of the armies of the Philistines this day to the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saves not with sword and spear. For the battle is Jehovah's, and he will give you into our hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And David put his hand in his bag, and took from there a stone, and slung it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead. And the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. But there was no sword in the hand of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath of it, and killed him, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines until thou come to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And the sons of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And Saul said to him, Whose son are thou, young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Saul took him that day, and would no more let him go home to his father's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his belt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the women sang one to another as they played, and said, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him, and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands, and what can he have more but the kingdom?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house. And David played with his hand, as he did day by day, and Saul had his spear in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Saul cast the spear, for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David turned away from his presence twice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Saul was afraid of David because Jehovah was with him, and was departed from Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand, and he went out and came in before the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways, and Jehovah was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, I will give her to thee for a wife. Only be thou valiant for me, and fight Jehovah's battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But it came to pass at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite to wife.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David, Thou shall this day be my son-in-law a second time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Converse with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king has delight in thee, and all his servants love thee. Now therefore be the king's son-in-law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Does it seem to you a light thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner David spoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king does not desire any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. And the days were not expired.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And David arose and went, he and his men, and killed of the Philistines two hundred men. And David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David, and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Saul was yet the more afraid of David, and Saul was David's enemy continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the rulers of the Philistines went forth, and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was very precious.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill thee. Now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou are, and I will converse with my father of thee, and if I see anything, I will tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David, because he has not sinned against thee, and because his works have been very good toward thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and Jehovah wrought a great victory for all Israel. Thou saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will thou sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan. And Saul swore, As Jehovah lives, he shall not be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as beforetime.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there was war again. And David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter, and they fled before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And an evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing with his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the spear into the wall. And David fled, and escaped that night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Saul sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to kill him in the morning. And Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If thou save not thy life tonight, tomorrow thou will be slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Michal let David down through the window, and he went, and fled, and escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair at the head of it, and covered it with the clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' hair at the head of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Saul said to Michal, Why have thou deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, Let me go. Why should I kill thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu. And he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he went there to Naioth in Ramah, and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? What is my iniquity, and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeks my life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said to him, Far from it. Thou shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me, and why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And David swore moreover, and said, Thy father knows well that I have found favor in thine eyes, and he says, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved. But truly as Jehovah lives, and as thy soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Jonathan said to David, Whatever thy soul desires, I will even do it for thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David said to Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king to eat. But let me go that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If thy father misses me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city, for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If he says thus, It is well. Thy servant shall have peace. But if he is angry, then know that evil is determined by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore deal kindly with thy servant, for thou have brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee. But if there be in me iniquity, kill me thyself, for why should thou bring me to thy father?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee, for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would I not tell it to thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then David said to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answers thee roughly?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jonathan said to David, Jehovah, the God of Israel-when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send to thee, and disclose it to thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I not disclose it to thee, and send thee away that thou may go in peace. And Jehovah be with thee as he has been with my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And thou shall not only show me the loving kindness of Jehovah, while I yet live, that I not die,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but also thou shall not cut off thy kindness from my house forever. No, not when Jehovah has cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, And Jehovah will require it at the hand of David's enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him. For he loved him as he loved his own soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon, and thou will be missed because thy seat will be empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when thou have stayed three days, thou shall go down quickly, and come to the place where thou hid thyself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And, behold, I will send the lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them, and come, for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as Jehovah lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But if I say thus to the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee, go thy way, for Jehovah has sent thee away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And concerning the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between thee and me forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall, and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side, but David's place was empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Nevertheless Saul spoke nothing that day, for he thought, Something has befallen him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was the second day, that David's place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has the son of Jesse not come in to the food, neither yesterday, nor today?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he said, Let me go, I pray thee, for our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother, he has commanded me. And now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brothers. Therefore he has not come to the king's table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do I not know that thou have chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and to the shame of thy mother's nakedness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the ground, thou shall not be established, nor thy kingdom. Therefore now send and fetch him to me, for he shall surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why should he be put to death? What has he done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him. By this Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to put David to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David because his father had done him shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he said to his lad, Run, now find the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But the lad knew nothing. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. And they kissed each other, and wept one with another until David surpassed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, inasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, forever. And he arose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, Why are thou alone, and no man with thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, Let no man know anything of the business about which I send thee, and what I have commanded thee, and I have assigned the young men to such and such a place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now therefore what is under thy hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread. If only the young men have kept themselves from women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days. When I came out the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there but the showbread that was taken from before Jehovah to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah. And his name was Doeg the Edomite, the foremost of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou killed in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If thou will take that, take it, for there is no other except that here. And David said, There is none like that. Give it to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Achish said to his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad. Why then have ye brought him to me?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And he brought them before the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? Be it far from me. Let not the king impute anything to his servant, nor to all the house of my father, for thy servant knows nothing of all this, less or more.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing-floors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And Jehovah said to David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it was told Saul that David came to Keilah. And Saul said, God has delivered him into my hand, for he is shut in by entering into a town that has gates and bars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him, and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said David, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thy servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city for my sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? Will Saul come down as thy servant has heard? O Jehovah, the God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then David said, Will the men of Keilah deliver up me and my men into the hand of Saul? And Jehovah said, They will deliver thee up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah, and he ceased to go forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And David saw that Saul came out to seek his life, and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the forest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jonathan, Saul's son, arose, and went to David into the forest, and strengthened his hand in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to him, Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee. And thou shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to thee. And that, Saul my father also knows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And those two made a covenant before Jehovah. And David abode in the forest, and Jonathan went to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the forest, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of thy soul to come down, and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king's hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Saul said, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, for ye have had compassion on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Go, I pray you, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there, for it is told me that he deals very shrewdly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hides himself, and come ye again to me of a certainty. And I will go with you, and it shall come to pass, if he is in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul, but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David. Therefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain. And David made haste to get away for fear of Saul. For Saul and his men encompassed David and his men round about to take them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Hasten thee, and come, for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines. Therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And David went up from there, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave, and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the men of David said to him, Behold, the day of which Jehovah said to thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shall do to him as it shall seem good to thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe secretly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said to his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Jehovah's anointed, to put forth my hand against him, since he is Jehovah's anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So David restrained his men with these words, and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David said to Saul, Why do thou hearken to men's words, saying, Behold, David seeks thy hurt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that Jehovah had delivered thee today into my hand in the cave. And some bade me kill thee, but I spared thee. And I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord, for he is Jehovah's anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand, for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not. Know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though thou hunt after my life to take it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jehovah judge between me and thee, and Jehovah avenge me of thee, but my hand shall not be upon thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As says the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness, but my hand shall not be upon thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">After whom is the king of Israel come out? After whom do thou pursue? After a dead dog, after a flea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jehovah therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to David, Thou are more righteous than I, for thou have rendered to me good, whereas I have rendered to thee evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And thou have declared this day how that thou have dealt well with me, inasmuch as when Jehovah had delivered me up into thy hand, thou killed me not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away well? Therefore Jehovah reward thee good for that which thou have done to me this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And now, behold, I know that thou shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Swear now therefore to me by Jehovah, that thou will not cut off my seed after me, and that thou will not destroy my name out of my father's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home, but David and his men got up to the stronghold.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Samuel died. And all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And there was a man in Maon whose possessions were in Carmel. And the man was very great in goods, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats. And he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. And the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance, but the man was churlish and evil in his doings, and he was of the house of Caleb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And thus ye shall say to him who lives in prosperity, Peace be to thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be to all that thou have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And now I have heard that thou have shearers. Thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there anything missing to them all the while they were in Carmel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee. Therefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes, for we come in a good day. Give, I pray thee, whatever comes to thy hand to thy servants, and to thy son David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants now-a-days who break away every man from his master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men of whom I know not from where they are?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So David's young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And David said to his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword, and David also girded on his sword. And there went up after David about four hundred men, and two hundred abode by the baggage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master, and he railed at them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither did we miss anything as long as we went with them when we were in the fields.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They were a wall to us both by night and by day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now therefore know and consider what thou will do, for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house. For he is such a worthless fellow that a man cannot speak to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And she said to her young men, Go on before me, behold, I come after you. But she did not tell her husband Nabal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him, and he has returned me evil for good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertains to him by the morning light so much as one man-child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when Abigail saw David, she hastened, and alighted from her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And she fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity, and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom thou sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah lives, and as thy soul lives, since Jehovah has withheld thee from blood guiltiness, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And now this present which thy servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid. For Jehovah will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fights the battles of Jehovah, and evil shall not be found in thee all thy days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And though men be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Jehovah thy God. And the souls of thine enemies, them he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee prince over Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">that this shall be no grief to thee, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that thou have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. And when Jehovah shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed be thou, who have kept me this day from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For in very deed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, lives, who has withheld me from hurting thee, unless thou had hastened and come to meet me, surely there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one man-child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So David received from her hand that which she had brought him. And he said to her, Go up in peace to thy house. See, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Abigail came to Nabal, and, behold, he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. Therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And it came to pass about ten days after, that Jehovah smote Nabal, so that he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil, and the evil-doing of Nabal Jehovah has returned upon his own head. And David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when the servants of David came to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to thee, to take thee to him to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Abigail hastened, and arose, and rode upon a donkey, with five of her damsels who followed her. And she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they became his wives, both of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul definitely came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army. And Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So David and Abishai came to the people by night. And, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons with his spear stuck in the ground at his head, and Abner and the people lay round about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day. Now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not, for who can put forth his hand against Jehovah's anointed, and be guiltless?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And David said, As Jehovah lives, Jehovah will smite him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall go down into battle and perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jehovah forbid that I should put forth my hand against Jehovah's anointed. But now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's head, and they got away. And no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Jehovah was fallen upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off, a great space being between them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David cried out to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answer thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are thou that cries to the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And David said to Abner, Are not thou a valiant man? And who is like to thee in Israel? Why then have thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? For there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This thing is not good that thou have done. As Jehovah lives, ye are worthy to die because ye have not kept watch over your lord, Jehovah's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said, Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be Jehovah who has stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering, but if it be the sons of men, cursed be they before Jehovah. For they have driven me out this day that I should not cling to the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Jehovah. For the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when a man hunts a partridge in the mountains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Saul said, I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will no more do thee harm because my life was precious in thine eyes this day. Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And David answered and said, Behold the spear, O king! Let then one of the young men come over and fetch it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jehovah will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness, inasmuch as Jehovah delivered thee into my hand today, and I would not put forth my hand against Jehovah's anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in my eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Jehovah, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David. Thou shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines, and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel, so I shall escape out of his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath, and he sought no more again for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David said to Achish, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country that I may dwell there, for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day. Therefore Ziklag pertains to the kings of Judah to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites, for those nations were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old as thou go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David smote the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the apparel, and he returned, and came to Achish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Achish said, Against whom have ye made a raid today? And David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And David saved neither man nor woman alive to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David, and so has been his manner all the while he has dwelt in the country of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him. Therefore he shall be my servant forever.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare to fight with Israel. And Achish said to David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shall go out with me in the army, thou and thy men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David said to Achish, Therefore thou shall know what thy servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore I will make thee my chief bodyguard forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem. And Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Saul inquired of Jehovah, Jehovah answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Saul said to his servants, Seek me a woman who has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has a familiar spirit at En-dor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him. And they came to the woman by night, and he said, Divine to me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomever I shall name to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the woman said to him, Behold, thou know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. Why then do thou lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Saul swore to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah lives, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have thou deceived me? For thou are Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the king said to her, Be not afraid, for what do thou see? And the woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said to her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man comes up, and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Samuel said to Saul, Why have thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am greatly distressed, for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams. Therefore I have called thee, that thou may make known to me what I shall do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Samuel said, Why then do thou ask of me, since Jehovah departed from thee, and has become thine adversary?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jehovah has done to thee, as he spoke by me. And Jehovah has torn the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Because thou obeyed not the voice of Jehovah, and did not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore Jehovah has done this thing to thee this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moreover Jehovah will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow thou and thy sons shall be with me. Jehovah will also deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Saul fell straightaway his full length upon the earth, and was greatly afraid because of the words of Samuel, and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was greatly troubled, and said to him, Behold, thy handmaid has hearkened to thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened to thy words which thou spoke to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also to the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee, and eat, that thou may have strength when thou go on thy way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him, and he hearkened to their voice. So he arose from the ground, and sat upon the bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the woman had a fatted calf in the house. And she hastened, and killed it, and she took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants, and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek, and the Israelites encamped by the fountain which is in Jezreel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the rulers of the Philistines said, What are these Hebrews? And Achish said to the rulers of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away to me to this day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the rulers of the Philistines were angry with him. And the rulers of the Philistines said to him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where thou have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For with what does this man reconcile himself to his lord? Would it not be with the heads of these men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Achish called David, and said to him, As Jehovah lives, thou have been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the army is good in my sight, for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming to me to this day. Nevertheless the lords do not favor thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore now return, and go in peace, that thou not displease the lords of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David said to Achish, But what have I done? And what have thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou are good in my sight, as an agent of God, notwithstanding the rulers of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord who have come with thee, and as soon as ye are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="30">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and had taken captive the women and all that were in it, both small and great. They did not kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire. And their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters. But David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, I pray thee, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought there the ephod to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue, for thou shall surely overtake them, and shall without fail recover all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But David pursued, he and four hundred men, for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread. And he ate, and they gave him water to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. And when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him, for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And David said to him, To whom do thou belong? And from where are thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite. And my master left me because three days ago I fell sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongs to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And David said to him, Will thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear to me by God, that thou will neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them; David brought back all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor. And they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him. And when David came near to the people, he saluted them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows of those who went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have recovered except to every man his wife and his children that he may lead them away, and depart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then David said, Ye shall not do so, my brothers, with that which Jehovah has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And the battle went severely against Saul, and the archers overtook him, and he was greatly distressed because of the archers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Saul said to his armor bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not, for he was very afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God. And Jehovah do that which seems good to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians. And they fled before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the sons of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River, and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadarezer at their head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it was told David. And he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the Syrians fled before Israel. And David killed of the Syrians the men of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their army so that he died there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when all the kings who were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians were afraid to help the sons of Ammon any more.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel. And they destroyed the sons of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it came to pass at evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And David sent messengers, and took her. And she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness), and she returned to her house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the woman conceived. And she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when Uriah came to him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and a gift from the king followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when they had told David, saying, Uriah did not go down to his house, David said to Uriah, Have thou not come from a journey? Why did thou not go down to thy house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths, and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As thou live, and as thy soul lives, I will not do this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And David said to Uriah, Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when David had called him, he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunk. And at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but did not go down to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. And there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David, and Uriah the Hittite died also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he charged the messenger, saying, When thou have made an end of telling all the things concerning the war to the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he says to thee, Why did ye go so near to the city to fight? Did ye not know that they would shoot from the wall?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall so that he died at Thebez? Why did ye go so near the wall? Then thou shall say, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were upon them even to the entrance of the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall. And some of the king's servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then David said to the messenger, Thus thou shall say to Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make thy battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it. And encourage thou him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehovah sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city: the one rich, and the other poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The rich man had exceedingly many flocks and herds,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up. And it grew up together with him, and with his sons. It ate of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there came a traveler to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man who came to him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man who came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah lives, the man who has done this is worthy to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Nathan said to David, Thou are the man. Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah. And if that had been too little, I would have added to thee such and such things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Why have thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do that which is evil in his sight? Thou have smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be thy wife, and have slain him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house. And I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them to thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For thou did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said to David, Jehovah also has put away thy sin; thou shall not die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">However, because by this deed thou have given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child also that is born to thee shall surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Nathan departed to his house. And Jehovah struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">David therefore besought God for the child. And David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the elders of his house arose, and stood beside him, to raise him up from the ground, but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive we spoke to him, and he did not hearken to our voice, how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel. And he came into the house of Jehovah, and worshiped. Then he came to his own house, and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then his servants said to him, What thing is this that thou have done? Thou fasted and wept for the child while it was alive, but when the child was dead, thou arose and ate bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept. For I said, Who knows whether Jehovah will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. And she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet. And he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and took the royal city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yea, I have taken the city of waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it, lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he took the crown of their king from off his head. And the weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones. And it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceedingly much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he brought forth the people that were in it, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln. And thus he did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister whose name was Tamar. And Amnon the son of David loved her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Amnon was so frustrated that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar. For she was a virgin, and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother. And Jonadab was a very sly man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said to him, Why, O son of the king, are thou emaciated this way from day to day? Will thou not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jonadab said to him, Lie down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick. And when thy father comes to see thee, say to him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and make food for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she took the pan, and poured them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have all men out from me. And they went out every man from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes that she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me, for no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Do not do thou this folly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I, where shall I carry my shame? And as for thee, thou will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">However he would not hearken to her voice, but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Amnon hated her with exceedingly great hatred, for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And she said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is worse than the other that thou did to me. But he would not hearken to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, Put this woman out from me now, and bolt the door after her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And she had a garment of various colors upon her, for with such robes were the king's daughters who were virgins appareled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her. And she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon thy brother been with thee? But now hold thy peace, my sister. He is thy brother. Do not take this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant has sheep-shearers. Let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to thee. And he pressed him. However he would not go, but blessed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Absalom said, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Notice ye now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon, then kill him. Fear not; have I not commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got up upon his mule, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the news came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth, and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons, for Amnon only is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead, for only Amnon is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons have come; as thy servant said, so it is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. And the king also and all his servants wept very much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the soul of king David longed to go forth to Absalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched from there a wise woman, and said to her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and do not anoint thyself with oil, but be as a woman who has a long time mourned for the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And go in to the king, and speak on this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king said to her, What troubles thee? And she answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they say, Deliver him who smote his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also. Thus they will quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the king said to the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house, and the king and his throne be guiltless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king said, Whoever says anything to thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then she said, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that the avenger of blood not destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As Jehovah lives, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the woman said, Why then have thou devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as he who is guilty, in that the king does not fetch home again his banished one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we must die, and are as water split on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again, neither does God take away life, but devises means that he who is banished be not an outcast from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid. And thy handmaid said, I will now speak to the king. It may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For the king will hear to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then thy handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be gracious, for as an agent of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad. And Jehovah thy God be with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king answered and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, anything that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul lives, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken, for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thy servant Joab has done this thing to change the face of the matter. And my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an agent of God, to know all things that are on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king. And Joab said, Today thy servant knows that I have found favor in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and did not see the king's face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty; from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year's end that he cut it, because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king's weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a woman of a fair countenance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and he did not see the king's face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. And he sent again a second time, but he would not come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore he said to his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, Why have thy servants set my field on fire?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come here, that I may send thee to the king to say, Why have I come from Geshur? It were better for me to still be there. Now therefore let me see the king's face, and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Joab came to the king, and told him. And when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared for him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</VERS>

And it was so, that, when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Absalom said to him, See, thy matters are good and right, but there is no man appointed by the king to hear thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or case might come to me, and I would do for him justice!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was so, that, when any man came near to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And on this manner Absalom did to all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to Jehovah, in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the king said to him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem who were invited, and went in their simplicity. And they did not know anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee, for otherwise none of us shall escape from Absalom. Make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the king's servants said to the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall choose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and they remained in Beth-merhak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why do thou also go with us? Return, and abide with the king, for thou are a foreigner, and also an exile. Return to thine own place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Whereas thou came but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go where I may? Return thou, and take back thy brothers. Mercy and truth be with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there thy servant will also be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over. The king himself also passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And, lo, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar went up until all the people had finished passing out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city. If I shall find favor in the eyes of Jehovah he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But if he says thus, I have no delight in thee, behold, here I am. Let him do to me as seems good to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The king said also to Zadok the priest, Are thou not a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">See, I will remain at the fords of the wilderness until there comes word from you to report to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem, and they abode there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And David went up by the ascent of the mount of Olives, and wept as he went up, and he had his head covered, and went barefoot. And all the people who were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And it was told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And it came to pass, that, when David came to the top of the ascent, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn, and dirt upon his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And David said to him, If thou pass on with me, then thou will be a burden to me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">but if thou return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king. As I have been thy father's servant in time past, so I will now be thy servant, then thou will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And have thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? Therefore it shall be, that whatever thing thou shall hear out of the king's house, thou shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son. And by them ye shall send to me everything that ye shall hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when David was a little past the top of the ascent, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the king said to Ziba, What do thou mean by these? And Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem, for he said, Today the house of Israel will restore for me the kingdom of my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the king said to Ziba, Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is thine. And Ziba said, I do obeisance. Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out from there a man of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out, cursing as he came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jehovah has returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul in whose stead thou have reigned. And Jehovah has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son, and, behold, thou are taken in thine own mischief because thou are a man of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Jehovah has said to him, Curse David, who then shall say, Why have thou done so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite? Let him alone, and let him curse, for Jehovah has bidden him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done to me, and that Jehovah will reward me good for his cursing of me this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So David and his men went by the way, and Shimei went along on the hill-side opposite him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the king, and all the people who were with him, came weary, and he refreshed himself there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, Live, O king. Live, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why did thou not go with thy friend?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Hushai said to Absalom, No, but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will abide.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And again, whom should I serve? Is it not in the presence of his son? As I have served in thy father's presence, so I will be in thy presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to thy father's concubines that he has left to keep the house, and all Israel will hear that thou are abhorred by thy father. Then the hands of all who are with thee will be strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid. And all the people who are with him shall flee. And I will only smite the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and I will bring back all the people to thee. The man whom thou seek is as if all returned, so all the people shall be in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Absalom said, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner. Shall we do after his saying? If not, speak thou.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Hushai said moreover, Thou know thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field. And thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place. And it will come to pass, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt, for all Israel knows that thy father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So we shall come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground, and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river until there be not one small stone found there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Jehovah had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and thus have I counseled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Do not lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over, lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel. And a maid-servant used to go and tell them, and they went and told king David, for they might not be seen to come into the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But a lad saw them, and told Absalom. And they went away quickly, both of them, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim who had a well in his court, and they went down there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground grain on it. And nothing was known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They have gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David. And they said to David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water, for thus Ahithophel has counseled against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who was not gone over the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and got home to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself. And he died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And it came to pass, when David came to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and roasted grain, and beans, and lentils, and roasted pulse,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat. For they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But the people said, Thou shall not go forth. For if we flee away, they will not care for us, neither if half of us die, will they care for us, but thou are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that thou be ready to help us out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king said to them, What seems best to you I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the people went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak. And he was taken up between sky and earth, and the mule that was under him went on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Joab said to the man who told him, and, behold, thou saw it, and why did thou not smite him there to the ground? And I would have given thee ten pieces of silver, and a belt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, yet I would not put forth my hand against the king's son, for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then thou thyself would have set thyself against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Joab said, I will not delay thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And ten young men who bore Joab's armor encompassed about and smote Absalom, and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel, for Joab held back the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled every man to his tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the king's valley, for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance. And he called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom's monument to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, Let me now run, and bear the king news, how that Jehovah has avenged him of his enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Joab said to him, Thou shall not be the bearer of news this day, but thou shall bear news another day. But this day thou shall bear no news, because the king's son is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Joab said to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou have seen. And the Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Why will thou run, my son, seeing that thou will have no reward for the news?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But come what may, he said, I will run. And he said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now David was sitting between the two gates. And the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he is alone, there is news in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the watchman saw another man running. And the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold, another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, even me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the king said, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And, behold, the Cushite came. And the Cushite said, News for my lord the king, for Jehovah has avenged thee this day of all those who rose up against thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people, for the people heard say that day, The king grieves for his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the people slipped away that day into the city, as people who are ashamed sneak away when they flee in battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou have shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">in that thou love those who hate thee, and hate those who love thee. For thou have declared this day that rulers and servants are nothing to thee. For this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it would have pleased thee well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak graciously to thy servants. For I swear by Jehovah, if thou do not go forth, there will not remain a man with thee this night. And that will be worse to thee than all the evil that has befallen thee from thy youth until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate. And all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And all the people were contending throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines. And now he fled out of the land from Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? Since the speech of all Israel has come to the king, to bring him to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Ye are my brothers, ye are my bone and my flesh. Why then are ye the last to bring back the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And say ye to Amasa, Are thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou not be captain of the army before me continually in the place of Joab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he inclined the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man, so that they sent to the king, saying, Return thou, and all thy servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hastened and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him. And they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And there went over a ferry-boat to bring over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king when he came over the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity to me, neither remember thou that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For thy servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore, behold, I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovah's anointed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries to me? Shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="43">And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye. Why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be had first in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Joab said to the king, Now Jehovah thy God add to the people, however many they may be, a hundredfold, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it, but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. And Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi. And they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Sidon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites. And they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So when they had gone to and fro through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to the king. And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people. And David said to Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done, but now, O Jehovah, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done very foolishly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when David rose up in the morning, the word of Jehovah came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Go and speak to David, Thus says Jehovah, I offer thee three things. Choose thee one of them, that I may do it to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to thee in thy land? Or will thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in thy land? Now decide, and see what answer I shall return to him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait. Let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah, for his mercies are great, and let me not fall into the hand of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed. And there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when the agent stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah relented of the evil, and said to the agent who destroyed the people, It is enough. Now stay thy hand. And the agent of Jehovah was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And David spoke to Jehovah when he saw the agent who smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done perversely, but these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Jehovah commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. And Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Araunah said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor from thee, to build an altar to Jehovah that the plague may be halted from the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Behold, the oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king. And Araunah said to the king, Jehovah thy God accept thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the king said to Araunah, No, but I will truly buy it from thee at a price. Neither will I offer burnt offerings to Jehovah my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And David built there an altar to Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was halted from Israel.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now king David was old and stricken in years, and they covered him with clothes, but he did not get warm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. And let her stand before the king, and take care of him. And let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get warmth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the damsel was very fair. And she took care of the king, and ministered to him, but the king knew her not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king. And he prepared chariots for him, and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have thou done so? And he was also a very handsome man. And he was born after Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. And, following Adonijah, they helped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Adonijah killed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel. And he called all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But he did not call Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord does not know it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou may save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Go and get thee in to king David, and say to him, Did thou not, my lord, O king, swear to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, while thou yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber. And the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What do thou want?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And she said to him, My lord, thou swore by Jehovah thy God to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And now, behold, Adonijah reigns, and thou, my lord the king, do not know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army, but he has not called Solomon thy servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be considered offenders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he came in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For he has gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, Live, king Adonijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, he has not called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou have not shown to thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then king David answered and said, Call Bathsheba to me. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the king swore, and said, As Jehovah lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">truly as I swore to thee by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead. Surely so I will do this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And king David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. And blow ye the trumpet, and say, Live, king Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne, for he shall be king in my stead. And I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Truly. Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">As Jehovah has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, Live, king Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth quivered with the sound of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. And Adonijah said, Come in, for thou are a worthy man, and bring good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Truly our lord king David has made Solomon king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. And they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And also thus said the king, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who has given one of my seed to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and every man went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Adonijah feared because of Solomon. And he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon, for, lo, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth, but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon. And Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the days of David drew near that he should die. And he charged Solomon his son, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I am going the way of all the earth. Be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and keep the charge of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou may prosper in all that thou do, and wherever thou turn thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">That Jehovah may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy sons take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee a man on the throne of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover thou also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his belt that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and do not let his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those who eat at thy table, for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom thy brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by Jehovah, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for thou are a wise man, and thou will know what thou ought to do to him, and thou shall bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was established greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Do thou come peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said moreover, I have something to say to thee. And she said, Say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said, Thou know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign. However the kingdom is turned about, and has become my brother's, for it was his from Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And now I ask one petition of thee; do not deny me. And she said to him, Say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king (for he will not say no thee), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Bathsheba said, Well, I will speak for thee to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king's mother. And she sat on his right hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; do not deny me. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother, for I will not deny thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why do thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my elder brother, even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then king Solomon swore by Jehovah, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now therefore as Jehovah lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And king Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he fell upon him so that he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Get thee to Anathoth, to thine own fields, for thou are worthy of death. But I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou bore the ark of the lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou were afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah, that he might fulfill the word of Jehovah, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the news came to Joab, for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he did not turn after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it was told king Solomon, Joab has fled to the tent of Jehovah, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Benaiah came to the tent of Jehovah, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And he said, No, but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him, and bury him, that thou may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Jehovah will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, and my father David did not know it, namely, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed forever. But to David, and to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, there shall be peace forever from Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and killed him. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army. And the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build for thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth from there anywhere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For on the day thou go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shall surely die; thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good. As my lord the king has said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. And Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not adjure thee by Jehovah, and protest to thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou go out, and walk abroad anywhere, thou shall surely die? And thou said to me, The saying that I have heard is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Why then have thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou know all the iniquity which thy heart is privy to, what thou did to David my father. Therefore Jehovah shall return thy iniquity upon thine own head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And he went out, and fell upon him so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Jehovah until those days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Solomon loved Jehovah, walking in the statutes of David his father. Only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings upon that altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Solomon said, Thou have shown to thy servant David my father great loving kindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee. And thou have kept for him this great loving kindness, that thou have given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And now, O Jehovah my God, thou have made thy servant king instead of David my father. And I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou have chosen, a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and evil, for who is able to judge this thy great people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God said to him, Because thou have asked this thing, and have not asked for thyself long life, neither have asked riches for thyself, nor have asked the life of thine enemies, but have asked for thyself understanding to discern justice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">behold, I have done according to thy word. Lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart, so that there has been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I have also given thee that which thou have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like thee all thy days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And if thou will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David walked, then I will lengthen thy days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then two women who were harlots came to the king, and stood before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house. And I was delivered of a child with her in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also. And we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, except we two in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this woman's child died in the night, because she lay upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">So he also made for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood out of a fourth part of the wall,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">In the fourth year the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid, in the month Ziv.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished throughout all the parts of it, and according to all the fashion of it. So he was seven years in building it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a workman in brass. And he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece. And a line of twelve cubits encompassed each of them around.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he made two capitals of molten brass to set upon the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">There were nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And there were capitals also above upon the two pillars, close by the protuberance which was beside the network. And the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon the other capital.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple. And he set up the right pillar, and called the name of it Jachin, and he set up the left pillar, and called the name of it Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height of it was five cubits. And a line of thirty cubits encompassed it round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And under the brim of it round about there were knops which encompassed it, for ten cubits, encompassing the sea round about. The knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east. And the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and three cubits the height of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the work of the bases was on this manner: They had panels, and there were panels between the ledges.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim. And upon the ledges there was a pedestal above. And beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit. And the mouth of it was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half. And also upon the mouth of it were engravings. And their panels were foursquare, not round.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the four wheels were underneath the panels. And the axletrees of the wheels were in the base. And the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel. Their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And there were four supports at the four corners of each base. The supports of it were of the base itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And in the top of the base there was a round band half a cubit high. And on the top of the base the ledges of it and the panels of it were of the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And on the plates of the ledges of it, and on the panels of it, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he made ten basins of brass. One basin contained forty baths. And every basin was four cubits. And upon every one of the ten bases one basin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. And he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the bowls. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="44">and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">and the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls. And all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah were of burnished brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were very many; the weight of the brass could not be found out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Jehovah: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">and the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold, and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="51">Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated-the silver, and the gold, and the vessels-and put them in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there, but I chose David to be over my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spoke to thy servant David my father.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="63">And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to Jehovah, twenty-two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the sons of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">The same day the king hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah, for there he offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too little to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that labored in the work.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah, she came to prove him with hard questions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she conversed with him of all that was in her heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Solomon answered to her all her questions; there was not anything hid from the king which he did not answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and the food of his table, and the seating of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah, there was no more spirit in her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">However I did not believe the words until I came, and my eyes had seen it. And, behold, the half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, who hear thy wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of Israel. Because Jehovah loved Israel forever, therefore he made thee king, to do justice and righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices a very great store, and precious stones. There came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the king made pillars of the almug trees for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, also harps and psalteries for the singers. There have come no such almug trees, nor were seen, to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty and six talents of gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">besides that which the traders brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind. And there were supports on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the supports.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver; it was accounted of nothing in the days of Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram. Once every three years the navy of Tarshish came, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines. And his wives turned away his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods. And his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God as was the heart of David his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and went not fully after Jehovah as did David his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab on the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the sons of Ammon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And so he did for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not keep that which Jehovah commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore Jehovah said to Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done by thee, and thou have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Notwithstanding I will not do it in thy days, for David thy father's sake, but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jehovah raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. He was of the king's seed in Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart that I may go to my own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seek to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing, however only let me depart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And God raised up another adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop when David killed them of Zobah. And they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor. And Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel came to Shechem to make him king.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Thy father made our yoke grievous. Now therefore make thou lighter the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye to me to return an answer to this people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they spoke to him, saying, If thou will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that grew up with him, who stood before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said to them, What counsel give ye, that we may return an answer to this people who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father put upon us lighter?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the young men that grew up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall thou say to this people that spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter to us; thus shall thou speak to them, My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the king did not hearken to the people, for it was a thing brought about by Jehovah, that he might establish his word, which Jehovah spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar.

      <VERS vnumber="33">And he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart. And he ordained a feast for the sons of Israel, and went up to the altar to burn incense.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Jehovah to Bethel. And Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.</VERS>

And upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones they shall burn upon thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Jehovah has spoken: Behold, the altar shall be torn, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The altar also was torn, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king answered and said to the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Jehovah thy God, and pray for me that my hand may be restored to me again. And the man of God entreated Jehovah, and the king's hand was restored to him again, and became as it was before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the man of God said to the king, If thou will give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">for so it was charged me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou shall eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel. And one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. The words which he had spoken to the king, they also told them to their father.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee. Neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place;</VERS>

Therefore Jehovah has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him, and slain him, according to the word of Jehovah which he spoke to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle the donkey for me. And they saddled it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the donkey, and brought it back. And he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he laid his body in his own grave. And they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulcher in which the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the saying which he cried by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">After this thing Jeroboam did not return from his evil way, but again made from among all the people priests of the high places. Whoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver. And he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and dealt wickedly above all who were before him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him. And he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it thou, my lord Elijah?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And Elijah said, As Jehovah of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he answered, I have not troubled Israel, but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah, and thou have followed the Baalim.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped about the altar which was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is meditating, or he is gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps and must be awakened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening oblation, but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah that was thrown down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob to whom the word of Jehovah came, saying, Israel shall be thy name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah. And he made a trench around the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he said, Do it the second time, and they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time, and they did it the third time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the water ran round about the altar, and he also filled the trench with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening oblation, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou are God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Hear me, O Jehovah, hear me, that this people may know that thou, Jehovah, are God, and that thou have turned their heart back again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then the fire of Jehovah fell, and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces. And they said, Jehovah, he is God, Jehovah, he is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them, and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Elijah said to Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of abundance of rain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel, and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="44">And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, a cloud rises out of the sea, as small as a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Make ready thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain not stop thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And it came to pass in a little while, that the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And the hand of Jehovah was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life. And he came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree. And he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough, now, O Jehovah, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he lay down and slept under a juniper tree, and, behold, an agent touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the coals, and a cruse of water. And he ate and drank, and laid him down again.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And he came to a cave there, and lodged there. And, behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, and he said to him, What are thou doing here, Elijah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts. For the sons of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword. And I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah. And, behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before Jehovah, but Jehovah was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but Jehovah was not in the earthquake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And after the earthquake a fire, but Jehovah was not in the fire. And after the fire a still small voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice to him, and said, What are thou doing here, Elijah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts. For the sons of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword. And I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life to take it away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jehovah said to him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when thou come, thou shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And thou shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Israel. And thou shall anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah to be prophet in thy place.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? Get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, No, for Jehovah has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said, Thus says Jehovah, Make this valley full of trenches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For thus says Jehovah, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain, yet that valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this is but a light thing in the sight of Jehovah. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings came up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they said, This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have smitten each man his fellow. Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them, and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they beat down the cities. And on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it. And they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth only they left the stones of it. However the slingers went about it, and smote it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too hard for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he took his eldest son who should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel, and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead, and thou know that thy servant feared Jehovah, and the creditor has come to take my two children to him to be bondmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for thee? Tell me, what have thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid has not anything in the house except a pot of oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then he said, Go, borrow for thee vessels abroad from all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And thou shall go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels, and thou shall set aside that which is full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons. They brought the vessels to her, and she poured out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, There is no more a vessel. And the oil halted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons from the rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it fell on a day that Elisha passed to Shunem where there was a prominent woman. And she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as often as he passed by he turned in there to eat bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God who passes by us continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the wall. And let us set a bed for him there, and a table, and a seat, and a lampstand. And it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it fell on a day that he came there, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou have been caring for us with all this care. What is to be done for thee? Would thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Truly she has no son, and her husband is old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said, At this season, when the time comes round, thou shall embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when the child was grown, it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the reapers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to his servant, Carry him to his mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said, Why will thou go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward. Do not restrain my riding unless I bid thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So she went, and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away, but the man of God said, Let her alone, for her soul is vexed within her, and Jehovah has hid it from me, and has not told me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? Did I not say, do not deceive me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way. If thou meet any man, do not salute him, and if any salute thee, do not answer him again. And lay my staff upon the face of the child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the mother of the child said, As Jehovah lives, and as thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child, but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child has not awakened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And when Elisha came into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He went in therefore, and shut the door upon the two of them, and prayed to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands. And he stretched himself upon him, and the flesh of the child grew warm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro, and went up, and stretched himself upon him. And the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, Take up thy son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground. And she took up her son, and went out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a dearth in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him. And he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered wild gourds from it, his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage, for they did not know them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot, and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And a man came from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give to the people that they may eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And his servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give to the people that they may eat, for thus says Jehovah, They shall eat, and shall leave of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">So he set it before them, and they ate, and left of it according to the word of Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Jehovah had given victory to Syria. He was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden, and she waited on Naaman's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And she said to her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And a man went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden who is of the land of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter has come to thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee that thou may heal him of his leprosy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have thou torn thy clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shall be clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought he will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And his servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, would thou not have done it? How much rather then, when he says to thee, Wash, and be clean?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God. And his flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him. And he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, take a present from thy servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But he said, As Jehovah lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it, but he refused.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray thee, let there be given to thy servant two mules' burden of dirt, for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon thy servant in this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As Jehovah lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets. Give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants, and they bore them before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house, and he let the men go, and they departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, From where did thou come, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went nowhere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he said to him, Did not my heart go with thee when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid-servants?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cling to thee, and to thy seed forever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And one said, Be pleased, I pray thee, to go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water. And he cried, and said, Alas, my master! For it was borrowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in there, and made the iron to float.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said, Take it up to thee. So he put out his hand, and took it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel, and he took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou not pass such a place, for the Syrians are coming down there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of. And he saved himself there, not once nor twice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled for this thing, and he called his servants, and said to them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And one of his servants said, No, my lord, O king, but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel tells the king of Israel the words that thou speak in thy bedchamber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he said, Go and see where he is that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore he sent there horses, and chariots, and a great army. And they came by night, and encompassed the city about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an army with horses and chariots was round about the city. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! What shall we do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he answered, Fear not, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray thee, open his eyes that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw. And, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</VERS>

And the king sent a man from before him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, Do ye see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head?

      <VERS vnumber="3">Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate, and they said one to another, Why do we sit here until we die?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we shall live, and if they kill us, we shall but die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians. And when they came to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army. And they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank, and carried from there silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it. And they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried from there also, and went and hid it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then they said one to another, We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we delay till the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And he called the porters, and they told it to the king's household within.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the king arose in the night, and said to his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city we shall take them alive, and get into the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And one of his servants answered and said, Let, I pray thee, some men take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are consumed), and let us send and see.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they were not afraid of Jehovah. Therefore Jehovah sent lions among them, which killed some of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou have carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria know not the law of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions among them, and, behold, they kill them, because they do not know the law of the god of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry there one of the priests whom ye brought from there, and let them go and dwell there. And let him teach them the law of the god of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak. And the Sepharvites burnt their sons in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So they were afraid of Jehovah, and made for them priests of the high places from among themselves, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They were afraid of Jehovah, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jehovah was with him. Wherever he went forth he prospered. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and did not serve him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">But Rabshakeh said to them, Has my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? Has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own urine with you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying, Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Thus says the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Do not hearken to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me. And eat ye every man of his vine, and every man of his fig tree, and drink ye every man the waters of his own cistern,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that ye may live, and not die. And do not hearken to Hezekiah when he persuades you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">But the people were silent, and did not answer him a word, for the king's commandment was, saying, Do not answer him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar to Jehovah. For the full price thou shall give it me, that the plague may be stopped from the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Ornan said to David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Lo, I give thee the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And king David said to Ornan, No, but I will truly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt offering without cost.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And David the king said to all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great, for the palace is not for man, but for Jehovah God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the brass for the things of brass, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, onyx stones, and stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artisans. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Jehovah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the rulers of the fathers, and the rulers of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And those with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Jehovah under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Jehovah. And David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore David praised Jehovah before all the assembly. And David said, Blessed be thou, O Jehovah, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thine, O Jehovah, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and on the earth is thine. Thine is the kingdom, O Jehovah, and thou are exalted as head above all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou rule over all. And in thy hand is power and might. And in thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength to all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? For all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">O Jehovah our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name comes of thy hand, and is all thine own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I know also, my God, that thou try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. And now I have seen with joy thy people, who are present here, offer willingly to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace for thee, for which I have made provision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And David said to all the assembly, Now praise Jehovah your God. And all the assembly praised Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and did obeisance to Jehovah, and the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they sacrificed sacrifices to Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings to Jehovah on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and ate and drank before Jehovah on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to Jehovah to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And all the rulers, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor. And Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</VERS>
