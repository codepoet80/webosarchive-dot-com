      <VERS vnumber="1">All wisdom cometh from the Lord, and is with him for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of eternity?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Who can find out the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the deep, and wisdom?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The word of God most high is the fountain of wisdom; and her ways are everlasting commandments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed? or who hath known her wise counsels?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">[Unto whom hath the knowledge of wisdom been made manifest? and who hath understood her great experience?]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">There is one wise and greatly to be feared, the Lord sitting upon his throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He created her, and saw her, and numbered her, and poured her out upon all his works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">She is with all flesh according to his gift, and he hath given her to them that love him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness, and a crown of rejoicing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The fear of the Lord maketh a merry heart, and giveth joy, and gladness, and a long life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Whoso feareth the Lord, it shall go well with him at the last, and he shall find favour in the day of his death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and it was created with the faithful in the womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">She hath built an everlasting foundation with men, and she shall continue with their seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To fear the Lord is fulness of wisdom, and filleth men with her fruits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">She filleth all their house with things desirable, and the garners with her increase.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, making peace and perfect health to flourish; both which are the gifts of God: and it enlargeth their rejoicing that love him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Wisdom raineth down skill and knowledge of understanding standing, and exalteth them to honour that hold her fast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and the branches thereof are long life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The fear of the Lord driveth away sins: and where it is present, it turneth away wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">A furious man cannot be justified; for the sway of his fury shall be his destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">A patient man will tear for a time, and afterward joy shall spring up unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall declare his wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom: but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If thou desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord shall give her unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction: and faith and meekness are his delight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Distrust not the fear of the Lord when thou art poor: and come not unto him with a double heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Be not an hypocrite in the sight of men, and take good heed what thou speakest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Exalt not thyself, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon thy soul, and so God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in the midst of the congregation, because thou camest not in truth to the fear of the Lord, but thy heart is full of deceit.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for temptation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste in time of trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Cleave unto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be increased at thy last end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Whatsoever is brought upon thee take cheerfully, and be patient when thou art changed to a low estate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Believe in him, and he will help thee; order thy way aright, and trust in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and go not aside, lest ye fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Ye that fear the Lord, believe him; and your reward shall not fail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Ye that fear the Lord, hope for good, and for everlasting joy and mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Look at the generations of old, and see; did ever any trust in the Lord, and was confounded? or did any abide in his fear, and was forsaken? or whom did he ever despise, that called upon him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, longsuffering, and very pitiful, and forgiveth sins, and saveth in time of affliction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Woe be to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and the sinner that goeth two ways!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Woe unto him that is fainthearted! for he believeth not; therefore shall he not be defended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Woe unto you that have lost patience! and what will ye do when the Lord shall visit you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They that fear the Lord will not disobey his Word; and they that love him will keep his ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They that fear the Lord will seek that which is well, pleasing unto him; and they that love him shall be filled with the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and humble their souls in his sight,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Saying, We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men: for as his majesty is, so is his mercy.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hear me your father, O children, and do thereafter, that ye may be safe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the Lord hath given the father honour over the children, and hath confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Whoso honoureth his father maketh an atonement for his sins:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up treasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Whoso honoureth his father shall have joy of his own children; and when he maketh his prayer, he shall be heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He that honoureth his father shall have a long life; and he that is obedient unto the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He that feareth the Lord will honour his father, and will do service unto his parents, as to his masters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Honour thy father and mother both in word and deed, that a blessing may come upon thee from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children; but the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Glory not in the dishonour of thy father; for thy father's dishonour is no glory unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; and a mother in dishonour is a reproach to the children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">My son, help thy father in his age, and grieve him not as long as he liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; and despise him not when thou art in thy full strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: and instead of sins it shall be added to build thee up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered; thy sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer; and he that angereth his mother is cursed: of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">My son, go on with thy business in meekness; so shalt thou be beloved of him that is approved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and thou shalt find favour before the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the power of the Lord is great, and he is honoured of the lowly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Seek not out things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence, for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things are shewed unto thee than men understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; and an evil suspicion hath overthrown their judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Without eyes thou shalt want light: profess not the knowledge therefore that thou hast not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the wicked man shall heap sin upon sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; for the plant of wickedness hath taken root in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; and an attentive ear is the desire of a wise man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms maketh an atonement for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which may come hereafter; and when he falleth, he shall find a stay.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, defraud not the poor of his living, and make not the needy eyes to wait long.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Make not an hungry soul sorrowful; neither provoke a man in his distress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Add not more trouble to an heart that is vexed; and defer not to give to him that is in need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Reject not the supplication of the afflicted; neither turn away thy face from a poor man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Turn not away thine eye from the needy, and give him none occasion to curse thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For if he curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, his prayer shall be heard of him that made him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Get thyself the love of the congregation, and bow thy head to a great man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Let it not grieve thee to bow down thine ear to the poor, and give him a friendly answer with meekness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Deliver him that suffereth wrong from the hand of the oppressor; and be not fainthearted when thou sittest in judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Be as a father unto the fatherless, and instead of an husband unto their mother: so shalt thou be as the son of the most High, and he shall love thee more than thy mother doth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Wisdom exalteth her children, and layeth hold of them that seek her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He that loveth her loveth life; and they that seek to her early shall be filled with joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He that holdeth her fast shall inherit glory; and wheresoever she entereth, the Lord will bless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They that serve her shall minister to the Holy One: and them that love her the Lord doth love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Whoso giveth ear unto her shall judge the nations: and he that attendeth unto her shall dwell securely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If a man commit himself unto her, he shall inherit her; and his generation shall hold her in possession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For at the first she will walk with him by crooked ways, and bring fear and dread upon him, and torment him with her discipline, until she may trust his soul, and try him by her laws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then will she return the straight way unto him, and comfort him, and shew him her secrets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But if he go wrong, she will forsake him, and give him over to his own ruin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Observe the opportunity, and beware of evil; and be not ashamed when it concerneth thy soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For there is a shame that bringeth sin; and there is a shame which is glory and grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Accept no person against thy soul, and let not the reverence of any man cause thee to fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And refrain not to speak, when there is occasion to do good, and hide not thy wisdom in her beauty.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Set thy heart upon thy goods; and say not, I have enough for my life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Follow not thine own mind and thy strength, to walk in the ways of thy heart:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Whereupon they wept, fasted, and prayed before the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They made also a collection of money according to every man's power:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they sent it to Jerusalem unto Joachim the high priest, the son of Chelcias, son of Salom, and to the priests, and to all the people which were found with him at Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">At the same time when he received the vessels of the house of the Lord, that were carried out of the temple, to return them into the land of Juda, the tenth day of the month Sivan, namely, silver vessels, which Sedecias the son of Josias king of Jada had made,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried away Jechonias, and the princes, and the captives, and the mighty men, and the people of the land, from Jerusalem, and brought them unto Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they said, Behold, we have sent you money to buy you burnt offerings, and sin offerings, and incense, and prepare ye manna, and offer upon the altar of the Lord our God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And pray for the life of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and for the life of Balthasar his son, that their days may be upon earth as the days of heaven:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Pray for us also unto the Lord our God, for we have sinned against the Lord our God; and unto this day the fury of the Lord and his wrath is not turned from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And ye shall read this book which we have sent unto you, to make confession in the house of the Lord, upon the feasts and solemn days.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And disobeyed him, and have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in the commandments that he gave us openly:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Since the day that the Lord brought our forefathers out of the land of Egypt, unto this present day, we have been disobedient unto the Lord our God, and we have been negligent in not hearing his voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wherefore the evils cleaved unto us, and the curse, which the Lord appointed by Moses his servant at the time that he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, to give us a land that floweth with milk and honey, like as it is to see this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Nevertheless we have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord our God, according unto all the words of the prophets, whom he sent unto us:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore the Lord hath made good his word, which he pronounced against us, and against our judges that judged Israel, and against our kings, and against our princes, and against the men of Israel and Juda,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">That a man should eat the flesh of his own son, and the flesh of his own daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Moreover he hath delivered them to be in subjection to all the kingdoms that are round about us, to be as a reproach and desolation among all the people round about, where the Lord hath scattered them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Thus we were cast down, and not exalted, because we have sinned against the Lord our God, and have not been obedient unto his voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">To the Lord our God appertaineth righteousness: but unto us and to our fathers open shame, as appeareth this day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Yet have we not prayed before the Lord, that we might turn every one from the imaginations of his wicked heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore the Lord watched over us for evil, and the Lord hath brought it upon us: for the Lord is righteous in all his works which he hath commanded us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">O Lord our God, we have sinned, we have done ungodly, we have dealt unrighteously in all thine ordinances.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Let thy wrath turn from us: for we are but a few left among the heathen, where thou hast scattered us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Hear our prayers, O Lord, and our petitions, and deliver us for thine own sake, and give us favour in the sight of them which have led us away:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our God, because Israel and his posterity is called by thy name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">O Lord, look down from thine holy house, and consider us: bow down thine ear, O Lord, to hear us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Open thine eyes, and behold; for the dead that are in the graves, whose souls are taken from their bodies, will give unto the Lord neither praise nor righteousness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the soul that is greatly vexed, which goeth stooping and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul, will give thee praise and righteousness, O Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore we do not make our humble supplication before thee, O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For thou hast sent out thy wrath and indignation upon us, as thou hast spoken by thy servants the prophets, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Thus saith the Lord, Bow down your shoulders to serve the king of Babylon: so shall ye remain in the land that I gave unto your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But if ye will not hear the voice of the Lord, to serve the king of Babylon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I will cause to cease out of the cites of Judah, and from without Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: and the whole land shall be desolate of inhabitants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But we would not hearken unto thy voice, to serve the king of Babylon: therefore hast thou made good the words that thou spakest by thy servants the prophets, namely, that the bones of our kings, and the bones of our fathers, should be taken out of their place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And, lo, they are cast out to the heat of the day, and to the frost of the night, and they died in great miseries by famine, by sword, and by pestilence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the house which is called by thy name hast thou laid waste, as it is to be seen this day, for the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Juda.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">O Lord our God, thou hast dealt with us after all thy goodness, and according to all that great mercy of thine,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">As thou spakest by thy servant Moses in the day when thou didst command him to write the law before the children of Israel, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">If ye will not hear my voice, surely this very great multitude shall be turned into a small number among the nations, where I will scatter them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For I knew that they would not hear me, because it is a stiffnecked people: but in the land of their captivities they shall remember themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And shall know that I am the Lord their God: for I will give them an heart, and ears to hear:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, and think upon my name,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And return from their stiff neck, and from their wicked deeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, which sinned before the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And I will bring them again into the land which I promised with an oath unto their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they shall be lords of it: and I will increase them, and they shall not be diminished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will no more drive my people of Israel out of the land that I have given them.</VERS>

      <CAPTION vref="1">The Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Jews</CAPTION>
      <VERS vnumber="1">And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name's sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham's sake, for thy servant Issac's sake, and for thy holy Israel's sake;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the king's servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There dwelt a man in Babylon, called Joacim:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he took a wife, whose name was Susanna, the daughter of Chelcias, a very fair woman, and one that feared the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Her parents also were righteous, and taught their daughter according to the law of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now Joacim was a great rich man, and had a fair garden joining unto his house: and to him resorted the Jews; because he was more honourable than all others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The same year were appointed two of the ancients of the people to be judges, such as the Lord spake of, that wickedness came from Babylon from ancient judges, who seemed to govern the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These kept much at Joacim's house: and all that had any suits in law came unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went into her husband's garden to walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the two elders saw her going in every day, and walking; so that their lust was inflamed toward her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they perverted their own mind, and turned away their eyes, that they might not look unto heaven, nor remember just judgments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And albeit they both were wounded with her love, yet durst not one shew another his grief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For they were ashamed to declare their lust, that they desired to have to do with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Yet they watched diligently from day to day to see her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the one said to the other, Let us now go home: for it is dinner time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So when they were gone out, they parted the one from the other, and turning back again they came to the same place; and after that they had asked one another the cause, they acknowledged their lust: then appointed they a time both together, when they might find her alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it fell out, as they watched a fit time, she went in as before with two maids only, and she was desirous to wash herself in the garden: for it was hot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And there was no body there save the two elders, that had hid themselves, and watched her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then she said to her maids, Bring me oil and washing balls, and shut the garden doors, that I may wash me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they did as she bade them, and shut the garden doors, and went out themselves at privy doors to fetch the things that she had commanded them: but they saw not the elders, because they were hid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now when the maids were gone forth, the two elders rose up, and ran unto her, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Behold, the garden doors are shut, that no man can see us, and we are in love with thee; therefore consent unto us, and lie with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">If thou wilt not, we will bear witness against thee, that a young man was with thee: and therefore thou didst send away thy maids from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Susanna sighed, and said, I am straitened on every side: for if I do this thing, it is death unto me: and if I do it not I cannot escape your hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It is better for me to fall into your hands, and not do it, than to sin in the sight of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">With that Susanna cried with a loud voice: and the two elders cried out against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then ran the one, and opened the garden door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So when the servants of the house heard the cry in the garden, they rushed in at the privy door, to see what was done unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when the elders had declared their matter, the servants were greatly ashamed: for there was never such a report made of Susanna.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And it came to pass the next day, when the people were assembled to her husband Joacim, the two elders came also full of mischievous imagination against Susanna to put her to death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And said before the people, Send for Susanna, the daughter of Chelcias, Joacim's wife. And so they sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So she came with her father and mother, her children, and all her kindred.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now Susanna was a very delicate woman, and beauteous to behold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And these wicked men commanded to uncover her face, (for she was covered) that they might be filled with her beauty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore her friends and all that saw her wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then the two elders stood up in the midst of the people, and laid their hands upon her head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And she weeping looked up toward heaven: for her heart trusted in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the elders said, As we walked in the garden alone, this woman came in with two maids, and shut the garden doors, and sent the maids away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then a young man, who there was hid, came unto her, and lay with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then we that stood in a corner of the garden, seeing this wickedness, ran unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when we saw them together, the man we could not hold: for he was stronger than we, and opened the door, and leaped out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But having taken this woman, we asked who the young man was, but she would not tell us: these things do we testify.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then the assembly believed them as those that were the elders and judges of the people: so they condemned her to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said, O everlasting God, that knowest the secrets, and knowest all things before they be:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me, and, behold, I must die; whereas I never did such things as these men have maliciously invented against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the Lord heard her voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Therefore when she was led to be put to death, the Lord raised up the holy spirit of a young youth whose name was Daniel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Who cried with a loud voice, I am clear from the blood of this woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Then all the people turned them toward him, and said, What mean these words that thou hast spoken?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">So he standing in the midst of them said, Are ye such fools, ye sons of Israel, that without examination or knowledge of the truth ye have condemned a daughter of Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Return again to the place of judgment: for they have borne false witness against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Wherefore all the people turned again in haste, and the elders said unto him, Come, sit down among us, and shew it us, seeing God hath given thee the honour of an elder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Then said Daniel unto them, Put these two aside one far from another, and I will examine them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">So when they were put asunder one from another, he called one of them, and said unto him, O thou that art waxen old in wickedness, now thy sins which thou hast committed aforetime are come to light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">For thou hast pronounced false judgment and hast condemned the innocent and hast let the guilty go free; albeit the Lord saith, The innocent and righteous shalt thou not slay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Now then, if thou hast seen her, tell me, Under what tree sawest thou them companying together? Who answered, Under a mastick tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And Daniel said, Very well; thou hast lied against thine own head; for even now the angel of God hath received the sentence of God to cut thee in two.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">So he put him aside, and commanded to bring the other, and said unto him, O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda, beauty hath deceived thee, and lust hath perverted thine heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Thus have ye dealt with the daughters of Israel, and they for fear companied with you: but the daughter of Juda would not abide your wickedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Now therefore tell me, Under what tree didst thou take them companying together? Who answered, Under an holm tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Then said Daniel unto him, Well; thou hast also lied against thine own head: for the angel of God waiteth with the sword to cut thee in two, that he may destroy you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and praised God, who saveth them that trust in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And they arose against the two elders, for Daniel had convicted them of false witness by their own mouth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And according to the law of Moses they did unto them in such sort as they maliciously intended to do to their neighbour: and they put them to death. Thus the innocent blood was saved the same day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Therefore Chelcias and his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna, with Joacim her husband, and all the kindred, because there was no dishonesty found in her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">From that day forth was Daniel had in great reputation in the sight of the people.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And king Astyages was gathered to his fathers, and Cyrus of Persia received his kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Daniel conversed with the king, and was honoured above all his friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now the Babylons had an idol, called Bel, and there were spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and six vessels of wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king worshipped it and went daily to adore it: but Daniel worshipped his own God. And the king said unto him, Why dost not thou worship Bel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Who answered and said, Because I may not worship idols made with hands, but the living God, who hath created the heaven and the earth, and hath sovereignty over all flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then said the king unto him, Thinkest thou not that Bel is a living God? seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Daniel smiled, and said, O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass without, and did never eat or drink any thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the king was wroth, and called for his priests, and said unto them, If ye tell me not who this is that devoureth these expences, ye shall die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if ye can certify me that Bel devoureth them, then Daniel shall die: for he hath spoken blasphemy against Bel. And Daniel said unto the king, Let it be according to thy word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now the priests of Bel were threescore and ten, beside their wives and children. And the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So Bel's priests said, Lo, we go out: but thou, O king, set on the meat, and make ready the wine, and shut the door fast and seal it with thine own signet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And to morrow when thou comest in, if thou findest not that Bel hath eaten up all, we will suffer death: or else Daniel, that speaketh falsely against us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they little regarded it: for under the table they had made a privy entrance, whereby they entered in continually, and consumed those things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So when they were gone forth, the king set meats before Bel. Now Daniel had commanded his servants to bring ashes, and those they strewed throughout all the temple in the presence of the king alone: then went they out, and shut the door, and sealed it with the king's signet, and so departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now in the night came the priests with their wives and children, as they were wont to do, and did eat and drinck up all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In the morning betime the king arose, and Daniel with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king said, Daniel, are the seals whole? And he said, Yea, O king, they be whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And as soon as he had opened the dour, the king looked upon the table, and cried with a loud voice, Great art thou, O Bel, and with thee is no deceit at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then laughed Daniel, and held the king that he should not go in, and said, Behold now the pavement, and mark well whose footsteps are these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the king said, I see the footsteps of men, women, and children. And then the king was angry,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And took the priests with their wives and children, who shewed him the privy doors, where they came in, and consumed such things as were upon the table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore the king slew them, and delivered Bel into Daniel's power, who destroyed him and his temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And in that same place there was a great dragon, which they of Babylon worshipped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the king said unto Daniel, Wilt thou also say that this is of brass? lo, he liveth, he eateth and drinketh; thou canst not say that he is no living god: therefore worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then said Daniel unto the king, I will worship the Lord my God: for he is the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But give me leave, O king, and I shall slay this dragon without sword or staff. The king said, I give thee leave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hair, and did seethe them together, and made lumps thereof: this he put in the dragon's mouth, and so the dragon burst in sunder : and Daniel said, Lo, these are the gods ye worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When they of Babylon heard that, they took great indignation, and conspired against the king, saying, The king is become a Jew, and he hath destroyed Bel, he hath slain the dragon, and put the priests to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So they came to the king, and said, Deliver us Daniel, or else we will destroy thee and thine house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now when the king saw that they pressed him sore, being constrained, he delivered Daniel unto them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Who cast him into the lions' den: where he was six days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given them every day two carcases, and two sheep: which then were not given to them, to the intent they might devour Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now there was in Jewry a prophet, called Habbacuc, who had made pottage, and had broken bread in a bowl, and was going into the field, for to bring it to the reapers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But the angel of the Lord said unto Habbacuc, Go, carry the dinner that thou hast into Babylon unto Daniel, who is in the lions' den.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Habbacuc said, Lord, I never saw Babylon; neither do I know where the den is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then the angel of the Lord took him by the crown, and bare him by the hair of his head, and through the vehemency of his spirit set him in Babylon over the den.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Habbacuc cried, saying, O Daniel, Daniel, take the dinner which God hath sent thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Daniel said, Thou hast remembered me, O God: neither hast thou forsaken them that seek thee and love thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">So Daniel arose, and did eat: and the angel of the Lord set Habbacuc in his own place again immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Upon the seventh day the king went to bewail Daniel: and when he came to the den, he looked in, and behold, Daniel was sitting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then cried the king with a loud voice, saying, Great art Lord God of Daniel, and there is none other beside thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he drew him out, and cast those that were the cause of his destruction into the den: and they were devoured in a moment before his face.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it happened, after that Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian, who came out of the land of Chettiim, had smitten Darius king of the Persians and Medes, that he reigned in his stead, the first over Greece,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And made many wars, and won many strong holds, and slew the kings of the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And went through to the ends of the earth, and took spoils of many nations, insomuch that the earth was quiet before him; whereupon he was exalted and his heart was lifted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he gathered a mighty strong host and ruled over countries, and nations, and kings, who became tributaries unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And after these things he fell sick, and perceived that he should die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherefore he called his servants, such as were honourable, and had been brought up with him from his youth, and parted his kingdom among them, while he was yet alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Alexander reigned twelves years, and then died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And his servants bare rule every one in his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And after his death they all put crowns upon themselves; so did their sons after them many years: and evils were multiplied in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And there came out of them a wicked root Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been an hostage at Rome, and he reigned in the hundred and thirty and seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In those days went there out of Israel wicked men, who persuaded many, saying, Let us go and make a covenant with the heathen that are round about us: for since we departed from them we have had much sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So this device pleased them well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then certain of the people were so forward herein, that they went to the king, who gave them licence to do after the ordinances of the heathen:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Whereupon they built a place of exercise at Jerusalem according to the customs of the heathen:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And made themselves uncircumcised, and forsook the holy covenant, and joined themselves to the heathen, and were sold to do mischief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now when the kingdom was established before Antiochus, he thought to reign over Egypt that he might have the dominion of two realms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Wherefore he entered into Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots, and elephants, and horsemen, and a great navy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And made war against Ptolemee king of Egypt: but Ptolemee was afraid of him, and fled; and many were wounded to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Thus they got the strong cities in the land of Egypt and he took the spoils thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And after that Antiochus had smitten Egypt, he returned again in the hundred forty and third year, and went up against Israel and Jerusalem with a great multitude,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And entered proudly into the sanctuary, and took away the golden altar, and the candlestick of light, and all the vessels thereof,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the table of the shewbread, and the pouring vessels, and the vials. and the censers of gold, and the veil, and the crown, and the golden ornaments that were before the temple, all which he pulled off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He took also the silver and the gold, and the precious vessels: also he took the hidden treasures which he found.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when he had taken all away, he went into his own land, having made a great massacre, and spoken very proudly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore there was a great mourning in Israel, in every place where they were;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So that the princes and elders mourned, the virgins and young men were made feeble, and the beauty of women was changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Every bridegroom took up lamentation, and she that sat in the marriage chamber was in heaviness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The land also was moved for the inhabitants thereof, and all the house of Jacob was covered with confusion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And after two years fully expired the king sent his chief collector of tribute unto the cities of Juda, who came unto Jerusalem with a great multitude,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And spake peaceable words unto them, but all was deceit: for when they had given him credence, he fell suddenly upon the city, and smote it very sore, and destroyed much people of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when he had taken the spoils of the city, he set it on fire, and pulled down the houses and walls thereof on every side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But the women and children took they captive, and possessed the cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then builded they the city of David with a great and strong wall, and with mighty towers, and made it a strong hold for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they put therein a sinful nation, wicked men, and fortified themselves therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">They stored it also with armour and victuals, and when they had gathered together the spoils of Jerusalem, they laid them up there, and so they became a sore snare:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For it was a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, and an evil adversary to Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Thus they shed innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary, and defiled it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Insomuch that the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them: whereupon the city was made an habitation of strangers, and became strange to those that were born in her; and her own children left her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness, her feasts were turned into mourning, her sabbaths into reproach her honour into contempt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">As had been her glory, so was her dishonour increased, and her excellency was turned into mourning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Moreover king Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom, that all should be one people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And every one should leave his laws: so all the heathen agreed according to the commandment of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Yea, many also of the Israelites consented to his religion, and sacrificed unto idols, and profaned the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For the king had sent letters by messengers unto Jerusalem and the cities of Juda that they should follow the strange laws of the land,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And forbid burnt offerings, and sacrifice, and drink offerings, in the temple; and that they should profane the sabbaths and festival days:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And pollute the sanctuary and holy people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Set up altars, and groves, and chapels of idols, and sacrifice swine's flesh, and unclean beasts:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">That they should also leave their children uncircumcised, and make their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness and profanation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">To the end they might forget the law, and change all the ordinances.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And whosoever would not do according to the commandment of the king, he said, he should die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">In the selfsame manner wrote he to his whole kingdom, and appointed overseers over all the people, commanding the cities of Juda to sacrifice, city by city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then many of the people were gathered unto them, to wit every one that forsook the law; and so they committed evils in the land;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And drove the Israelites into secret places, even wheresoever they could flee for succour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and fifth year, they set up the abomination of desolation upon the altar, and builded idol altars throughout the cities of Juda on every side;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And burnt incense at the doors of their houses, and in the streets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And when they had rent in pieces the books of the law which they found, they burnt them with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And whosoever was found with any the book of the testament, or if any committed to the law, the king's commandment was, that they should put him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Thus did they by their authority unto the Israelites every month, to as many as were found in the cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Now the five and twentieth day of the month they did sacrifice upon the idol altar, which was upon the altar of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">At which time according to the commandment they put to death certain women, that had caused their children to be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And they hanged the infants about their necks, and rifled their houses, and slew them that had circumcised them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Howbeit many in Israel were fully resolved and confirmed in themselves not to eat any unclean thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Wherefore the rather to die, that they might not be defiled with meats, and that they might not profane the holy covenant: so then they died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">And there was very great wrath upon Israel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days arose Mattathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, and dwelt in Modin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he had five sons, Joannan, called Caddis:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon; called Thassi:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Judas, who was called Maccabeus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Eleazar, called Avaran: and Jonathan, whose surname was Apphus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when he saw the blasphemies that were committed in Juda and Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He said, Woe is me! wherefore was I born to see this misery of my people, and of the holy city, and to dwell there, when it was delivered into the hand of the enemy, and the sanctuary into the hand of strangers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Her temple is become as a man without glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her glorious vessels are carried away into captivity, her infants are slain in the streets, her young men with the sword of the enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">What nation hath not had a part in her kingdom and gotten of her spoils?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All her ornaments are taken away; of a free woman she is become a bondslave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And, behold, our sanctuary, even our beauty and our glory, is laid waste, and the Gentiles have profaned it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">To what end therefore shall we live any longer?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Mattathias and his sons rent their clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourned very sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In the mean while the king's officers, such as compelled the people to revolt, came into the city Modin, to make them sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when many of Israel came unto them, Mattathias also and his sons came together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then answered the king's officers, and said to Mattathias on this wise, Thou art a ruler, and an honourable and great man in this city, and strengthened with sons and brethren:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now therefore come thou first, and fulfil the king's commandment, like as all the heathen have done, yea, and the men of Juda also, and such as remain at Jerusalem: so shalt thou and thy house be in the number of the king's friends, and thou and thy children shall be honoured with silver and gold, and many rewards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Mattathias answered and spake with a loud voice, Though all the nations that are under the king's dominion obey him, and fall away every one from the religion of their fathers, and give consent to his commandments:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yet will I and my sons and my brethren walk in the covenant of our fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">God forbid that we should forsake the law and the ordinances.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">We will not hearken to the king's words, to go from our religion, either on the right hand, or the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now when he had left speaking these words, there came one of the Jews in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar which was at Modin, according to the king's commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Which thing when Mattathias saw, he was inflamed with zeal, and his reins trembled, neither could he forbear to shew his anger according to judgment: wherefore he ran, and slew him upon the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Also the king's commissioner, who compelled men to sacrifice, he killed at that time, and the altar he pulled down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Thus dealt he zealously for the law of God like as Phinees did unto Zambri the son of Salom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Mattathias cried throughout the city with a loud voice, saying, Whosoever is zealous of the law, and maintaineth the covenant, let him follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So he and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that ever they had in the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then many that sought after justice and judgment went down into the wilderness, to dwell there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Both they, and their children, and their wives; and their cattle; because afflictions increased sore upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now when it was told the king's servants, and the host that was at Jerusalem, in the city of David, that certain men, who had broken the king's commandment, were gone down into the secret places in the wilderness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They pursued after them a great number, and having overtaken them, they camped against them, and made war against them on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they said unto them, Let that which ye have done hitherto suffice; come forth, and do according to the commandment of the king, and ye shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But they said, We will not come forth, neither will we do the king's commandment, to profane the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So then they gave them the battle with all speed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Howbeit they answered them not, neither cast they a stone at them, nor stopped the places where they lay hid;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But said, Let us die all in our innocency: heaven and earth will testify for us, that ye put us to death wrongfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So they rose up against them in battle on the sabbath, and they slew them, with their wives and children and their cattle, to the number of a thousand people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now when Mattathias and his friends understood hereof, they mourned for them right sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And one of them said to another, If we all do as our brethren have done, and fight not for our lives and laws against the heathen, they will now quickly root us out of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">At that time therefore they decreed, saying, Whosoever shall come to make battle with us on the sabbath day, we will fight against him; neither will we die all, as our brethren that were murdered im the secret places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Then came there unto him a company of Assideans who were mighty men of Israel, even all such as were voluntarily devoted unto the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Also all they that fled for persecution joined themselves unto them, and were a stay unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">So they joined their forces, and smote sinful men in their anger, and wicked men in their wrath: but the rest fled to the heathen for succour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then Mattathias and his friends went round about, and pulled down the altars:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And what children soever they found within the coast of Israel uncircumcised, those they circumcised valiantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">They pursued also after the proud men, and the work prospered in their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">So they recovered the law out of the hand of the Gentiles, and out of the hand of kings, neither suffered they the sinner to triumph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Now when the time drew near that Mattathias should die, he said unto his sons, Now hath pride and rebuke gotten strength, and the time of destruction, and the wrath of indignation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Now therefore, my sons, be ye zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Call to remembrance what acts our fathers did in their time; so shall ye receive great honour and an everlasting name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Joseph in the time of his distress kept the commandment and was made lord of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Phinees our father in being zealous and fervent obtained the covenant of an everlasting priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Jesus for fulfilling the word was made a judge in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Caleb for bearing witness before the congregation received the heritage of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">David for being merciful possessed the throne of an everlasting kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Elias for being zealous and fervent for the law was taken up into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, by believing were saved out of the flame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Daniel for his innocency was delivered from the mouth of lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And thus consider ye throughout all ages, that none that put their trust in him shall be overcome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Fear not then the words of a sinful man: for his glory shall be dung and worms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">To day he shall be lifted up and to morrow he shall not be found, because he is returned into his dust, and his thought is come to nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Wherefore, ye my sons, be valiant and shew yourselves men in the behalf of the law; for by it shall ye obtain glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And behold, I know that your brother Simon is a man of counsel, give ear unto him alway: he shall be a father unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">As for Judas Maccabeus, he hath been mighty and strong, even from his youth up: let him be your captain, and fight the battle of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Take also unto you all those that observe the law, and avenge ye the wrong of your people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">Recompense fully the heathen, and take heed to the commandments of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">So he blessed them, and was gathered to his fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">And he died in the hundred forty and sixth year, and his sons buried him in the sepulchres of his fathers at Modin, and all Israel made great lamentation for him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then his son Judas, called Maccabeus, rose up in his stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And all his brethren helped him, and so did all they that held with his father, and they fought with cheerfulness the battle of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So he gat his people great honour, and put on a breastplate as a giant, and girt his warlike harness about him, and he made battles, protecting the host with his sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In his acts he was like a lion, and like a lion's whelp roaring for his prey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For He pursued the wicked, and sought them out, and burnt up those that vexed his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherefore the wicked shrunk for fear of him, and all the workers of iniquity were troubled, because salvation prospered in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He grieved also many kings, and made Jacob glad with his acts, and his memorial is blessed for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Moreover he went through the cities of Juda, destroying the ungodly out of them, and turning away wrath from Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So that he was renowned unto the utmost part of the earth, and he received unto him such as were ready to perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Apollonius gathered the Gentiles together, and a great host out of Samaria, to fight against Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Which thing when Judas perceived, he went forth to meet him, and so he smote him, and slew him: many also fell down slain, but the rest fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Wherefore Judas took their spoils, and Apollonius' sword also, and therewith he fought all his life long.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when Seron, a prince of the army of Syria, heard say that Judas had gathered unto him a multitude and company of the faithful to go out with him to war;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said, I will get me a name and honour in the kingdom; for I will go fight with Judas and them that are with him, who despise the king's commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So he made him ready to go up, and there went with him a mighty host of the ungodly to help him, and to be avenged of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when he came near to the going up of Bethhoron, Judas went forth to meet him with a small company:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Who, when they saw the host coming to meet them, said unto Judas, How shall we be able, being so few, to fight against so great a multitude and so strong, seeing we are ready to faint with fasting all this day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Unto whom Judas answered, It is no hard matter for many to be shut up in the hands of a few; and with the God of heaven it is all one, to deliver with a great multitude, or a small company:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the victory of battle standeth not in the multitude of an host; but strength cometh from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">They come against us in much pride and iniquity to destroy us, and our wives and children, and to spoil us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But we fight for our lives and our laws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Wherefore the Lord himself will overthrow them before our face: and as for you, be ye not afraid of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now as soon as he had left off speaking, he leapt suddenly upon them, and so Seron and his host was overthrown before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they pursued them from the going down of Bethhoron unto the plain, where were slain about eight hundred men of them; and the residue fled into the land of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then began the fear of Judas and his brethren, and an exceeding great dread, to fall upon the nations round about them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Insomuch as his fame came unto the king, and all nations talked of the battles of Judas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now when king Antiochus heard these things, he was full of indignation: wherefore he sent and gathered together all the forces of his realm, even a very strong army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He opened also his treasure, and gave his soldiers pay for a year, commanding them to be ready whensoever he should need them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Nevertheless, when he saw that the money of his treasures failed and that the tributes in the country were small, because of the dissension and plague, which he had brought upon the land in taking away the laws which had been of old time;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He feared that he should not be able to bear the charges any longer, nor to have such gifts to give so liberally as he did before: for he had abounded above the kings that were before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Wherefore, being greatly perplexed in his mind, he determined to go into Persia, there to take the tributes of the countries, and to gather much money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So he left Lysias, a nobleman, and one of the blood royal, to oversee the affairs of the king from the river Euphrates unto the borders of Egypt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And to bring up his son Antiochus, until he came again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Moreover he delivered unto him the half of his forces, and the elephants, and gave him charge of all things that he would have done, as also concerning them that dwelt in Juda and Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">To wit, that he should send an army against them, to destroy and root out the strength of Israel, and the remnant of Jerusalem, and to take away their memorial from that place;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And that he should place strangers in all their quarters, and divide their land by lot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So the king took the half of the forces that remained, and departed from Antioch, his royal city, the hundred forty and seventh year; and having passed the river Euphrates, he went through the high countries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then Lysias chose Ptolemee the son of Dorymenes, Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men of the king's friends:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And with them he sent forty thousand footmen, and seven thousand horsemen, to go into the land of Juda, and to destroy it, as the king commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So they went forth with all their power, and came and pitched by Emmaus in the plain country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And the merchants of the country, hearing the fame of them, took silver and gold very much, with servants, and came into the camp to buy the children of Israel for slaves: a power also of Syria and of the land of the Philistines joined themselves unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Now when Judas and his brethren saw that miseries were multiplied, and that the forces did encamp themselves in their borders: for they knew how the king had given commandment to destroy the people, and utterly abolish them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">They said one to another, Let us restore the decayed fortune of our people, and let us fight for our people and the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then was the congregation gathered together, that they might be ready for battle, and that they might pray, and ask mercy and compassion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now Jerusalem lay void as a wilderness, there was none of her children that went in or out: the sanctuary also was trodden down, and aliens kept the strong hold; the heathen had their habitation in that place; and joy was taken from Jacob, and the pipe with the harp ceased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Wherefore the Israelites assembled themselves together, and came to Maspha, over against Jerusalem; for in Maspha was the place where they prayed aforetime in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Then they fasted that day, and put on sackcloth, and cast ashes upon their heads, and rent their clothes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And laid open the book of the law, wherein the heathen had sought to paint the likeness of their images.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">They brought also the priests' garments, and the firstfruits, and the tithes: and the Nazarites they stirred up, who had accomplished their days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Then cried they with a loud voice toward heaven, saying, What shall we do with these, and whither shall we carry them away?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">For thy sanctuary is trodden down and profaned, and thy priests are in heaviness, and brought low.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And lo, the heathen are assembled together against us to destroy us: what things they imagine against us, thou knowest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">How shall we be able to stand against them, except thou, O God, be our help?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Then sounded they with trumpets, and cried with a loud voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And after this Judas ordained captains over the people, even captains over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But as for such as were building houses, or had betrothed wives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, those he commanded that they should return, every man to his own house, according to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">So the camp removed, and pitched upon the south side of Emmaus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And Judas said, arm yourselves, and be valiant men, and see that ye be in readiness against the morning, that ye may fight with these nations, that are assembled together against us to destroy us and our sanctuary:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">For it is better for us to die in battle, than to behold the calamities of our people and our sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Nevertheless, as the will of God is in heaven, so let him do.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then took Gorgias five thousand footmen, and a thousand of the best horsemen, and removed out of the camp by night;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To the end he might rush in upon the camp of the Jews, and smite them suddenly. And the men of the fortress were his guides.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now when Judas heard thereof he himself removed, and the valiant men with him, that he might smite the king's army which was at Emmaus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">While as yet the forces were dispersed from the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In the mean season came Gorgias by night into the camp of Judas: and when he found no man there, he sought them in the mountains: for said he, These fellows flee from us</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But as soon as it was day, Judas shewed himself in the plain with three thousand men, who nevertheless had neither armour nor swords to their minds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they saw the camp of the heathen, that it was strong and well harnessed, and compassed round about with horsemen; and these were expert of war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then said Judas to the men that were with him, Fear ye not their multitude, neither be ye afraid of their assault.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Remember how our fathers were delivered in the Red sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with an army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now therefore let us cry unto heaven, if peradventure the Lord will have mercy upon us, and remember the covenant of our fathers, and destroy this host before our face this day:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">That so all the heathen may know that there is one who delivereth and saveth Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the strangers lifted up their eyes, and saw them coming over against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Wherefore they went out of the camp to battle; but they that were with Judas sounded their trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So they joined battle, and the heathen being discomfited fled into the plain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Howbeit all the hindmost of them were slain with the sword: for they pursued them unto Gazera, and unto the plains of Idumea, and Azotus, and Jamnia, so that there were slain of them upon a three thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This done, Judas returned again with his host from pursuing them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And said to the people, Be not greedy of the spoil inasmuch as there is a battle before us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Gorgias and his host are here by us in the mountain: but stand ye now against our enemies, and overcome them, and after this ye may boldly take the spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">As Judas was yet speaking these words, there appeared a part of them looking out of the mountain:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Who when they perceived that the Jews had put their host to flight and were burning the tents; for the smoke that was seen declared what was done:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When therefore they perceived these things, they were sore afraid, and seeing also the host of Judas in the plain ready to fight,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They fled every one into the land of strangers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Judas returned to spoil the tents, where they got much gold, and silver, and blue silk, and purple of the sea, and great riches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">After this they went home, and sung a song of thanksgiving, and praised the Lord in heaven: because it is good, because his mercy endureth forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now all the strangers that had escaped came and told Lysias what had happened:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Who, when he heard thereof, was confounded and discouraged, because neither such things as he would were done unto Israel, nor such things as the king commanded him were come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The next year therefore following Lysias gathered together threescore thousand choice men of foot, and five thousand horsemen, that he might subdue them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So they came into Idumea, and pitched their tents at Bethsura, and Judas met them with ten thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when he saw that mighty army, he prayed and said, Blessed art thou, O Saviour of Israel, who didst quell the violence of the mighty man by the hand of thy servant David, and gavest the host of strangers into the hands of Jonathan the son of Saul, and his armourbearer;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Shut up this army in the hand of thy people Israel, and let them be confounded in their power and horsemen:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Make them to be of no courage, and cause the boldness of their strength to fall away, and let them quake at their destruction:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Cast them down with the sword of them that love thee, and let all those that know thy name praise thee with thanksgiving.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">So they joined battle; and there were slain of the host of Lysias about five thousand men, even before them were they slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Now when Lysias saw his army put to flight, and the manliness of Judas' soldiers, and how they were ready either to live or die valiantly, he went into Antiochia, and gathered together a company of strangers, and having made his army greater than it was, he purposed to come again into Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then said Judas and his brethren, Behold, our enemies are discomfited: let us go up to cleanse and dedicate the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Upon this all the host assembled themselves together, and went up into mount Sion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And when they saw the sanctuary desolate, and the altar profaned, and the gates burned up, and shrubs growing in the courts as in a forest, or in one of the mountains, yea, and the priests' chambers pulled down;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">They rent their clothes, and made great lamentation, and cast ashes upon their heads,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And fell down flat to the ground upon their faces, and blew an alarm with the trumpets, and cried toward heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then Judas appointed certain men to fight against those that were in the fortress, until he had cleansed the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So he chose priests of blameless conversation, such as had pleasure in the law:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Who cleansed the sanctuary, and bare out the defiled stones into an unclean place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And when as they consulted what to do with the altar of burnt offerings, which was profaned;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">They thought it best to pull it down, lest it should be a reproach to them, because the heathen had defiled it: wherefore they pulled it down,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple in a convenient place, until there should come a prophet to shew what should be done with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Then they took whole stones according to the law, and built a new altar according to the former;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And made up the sanctuary, and the things that were within the temple, and hallowed the courts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">They made also new holy vessels, and into the temple they brought the candlestick, and the altar of burnt offerings, and of incense, and the table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And upon the altar they burned incense, and the lamps that were upon the candlestick they lighted, that they might give light in the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Furthermore they set the loaves upon the table, and spread out the veils, and finished all the works which they had begun to make.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Now on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month, which is called the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and eighth year, they rose up betimes in the morning,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And offered sacrifice according to the law upon the new altar of burnt offerings, which they had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Look, at what time and what day the heathen had profaned it, even in that was it dedicated with songs, and citherns, and harps, and cymbals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Then all the people fell upon their faces, worshipping and praising the God of heaven, who had given them good success.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And so they kept the dedication of the altar eight days and offered burnt offerings with gladness, and sacrificed the sacrifice of deliverance and praise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">They decked also the forefront of the temple with crowns of gold, and with shields; and the gates and the chambers they renewed, and hanged doors upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Thus was there very great gladness among the people, for that the reproach of the heathen was put away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Moreover Judas and his brethren with the whole congregation of Israel ordained, that the days of the dedication of the altar should be kept in their season from year to year by the space of eight days, from the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu, with mirth and gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">At that time also they builded up the mount Sion with high walls and strong towers round about, lest the Gentiles should come and tread it down as they had done before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And they set there a garrison to keep it, and fortified Bethsura to preserve it; that the people might have a defence against Idumea.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when the nations round about heard that the altar was built and the sanctuary renewed as before, it displeased them very much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Wherefore they thought to destroy the generation of Jacob that was among them, and thereupon they began to slay and destroy the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumea at Arabattine, because they besieged Gael: and he gave them a great overthrow, and abated their courage, and took their spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Also he remembered the injury of the children of Bean, who had been a snare and an offence unto the people, in that they lay in wait for them in the ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He shut them up therefore in the towers, and encamped against them, and destroyed them utterly, and burned the towers of that place with fire, and all that were therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Afterward he passed over to the children of Ammon, where he found a mighty power, and much people, with Timotheus their captain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So he fought many battles with them, till at length they were discomfited before him; and he smote them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when he had taken Jazar, with the towns belonging thereto, he returned into Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the heathen that were at Galaad assembled themselves together against the Israelites that were in their quarters, to destroy them; but they fled to the fortress of Dathema.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And sent letters unto Judas and his brethren, The heathen that are round about us are assembled together against us to destroy us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they are preparing to come and take the fortress whereunto we are fled, Timotheus being captain of their host.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Come now therefore, and deliver us from their hands, for many of us are slain:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yea, all our brethren that were in the places of Tobie are put to death: their wives and their children also they have carried away captives, and borne away their stuff; and they have destroyed there about a thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">While these letters were yet reading, behold, there came other messengers from Galilee with their clothes rent, who reported on this wise,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And said, They of Ptolemais, and of Tyrus, and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles, are assembled together against us to consume us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now when Judas and the people heard these words, there assembled a great congregation together, to consult what they should do for their brethren, that were in trouble, and assaulted of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then said Judas unto Simon his brother, Choose thee out men, and go and deliver thy brethren that are in Galilee, for I and Jonathan my brother will go into the country of Galaad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So he left Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the people, with the remnant of the host in Judea to keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Unto whom he gave commandment, saying, Take ye the charge of this people, and see that ye make not war against the heathen until the time that we come again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now unto Simon were given three thousand men to go into Galilee, and unto Judas eight thousand men for the country of Galaad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then went Simon into Galilee, where he fought many battles with the heathen, so that the heathen were discomfited by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he pursued them unto the gate of Ptolemais; and there were slain of the heathen about three thousand men, whose spoils he took.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And those that were in Galilee, and in Arbattis, with their wives and their children, and all that they had, took he away with him, and brought them into Judea with great joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Judas Maccabeus also and his brother Jonathan went over Jordan, and travelled three days' journey in the wilderness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Where they met with the Nabathites, who came unto them in a peaceable manner, and told them every thing that had happened to their brethren in the land of Galaad:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And how that many of them were shut up in Bosora, and Bosor, and Alema, Casphor, Maked, and Carnaim; all these cities are strong and great:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And that they were shut up in the rest of the cities of the country of Galaad, and that against to morrow they had appointed to bring their host against the forts, and to take them, and to destroy them all in one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Hereupon Judas and his host turned suddenly by the way of the wilderness unto Bosora; and when he had won the city, he slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burned the city with fire,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">From whence he removed by night, and went till he came to the fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And betimes in the morning they looked up, and, behold, there was an innumerable people bearing ladders and other engines of war, to take the fortress: for they assaulted them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When Judas therefore saw that the battle was begun, and that the cry of the city went up to heaven, with trumpets, and a great sound,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He said unto his host, Fight this day for your brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So he went forth behind them in three companies, who sounded their trumpets, and cried with prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then the host of Timotheus, knowing that it was Maccabeus, fled from him: wherefore he smote them with a great slaughter; so that there were killed of them that day about eight thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">This done, Judas turned aside to Maspha; and after he had assaulted it he took and slew all the males therein, and received the spoils thereof and and burnt it with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">From thence went he, and took Casphon, Maged, Bosor, and the other cities of the country of Galaad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">After these things gathered Timotheus another host and encamped against Raphon beyond the brook.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So Judas sent men to espy the host, who brought him word, saying, All the heathen that be round about us are assembled unto them, even a very great host.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He hath also hired the Arabians to help them and they have pitched their tents beyond the brook, ready to come and fight against thee. Upon this Judas went to meet them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then Timotheus said unto the captains of his host, When Judas and his host come near the brook, if he pass over first unto us, we shall not be able to withstand him; for he will mightily prevail against us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But if he be afraid, and camp beyond the river, we shall go over unto him, and prevail against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Now when Judas came near the brook, he caused the scribes of the people to remain by the brook: unto whom he gave commandment, saying, Suffer no man to remain in the camp, but let all come to the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">So he went first over unto them, and all the people after him: then all the heathen, being discomfited before him, cast away their weapons, and fled unto the temple that was at Carnaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But they took the city, and burned the temple with all that were therein. Thus was Carnaim subdued, neither could they stand any longer before Judas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then Judas gathered together all the Israelites that were in the country of Galaad, from the least unto the greatest, even their wives, and their children, and their stuff, a very great host, to the end they might come into the land of Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Now when they came unto Ephron, (this was a great city in the way as they should go, very well fortified) they could not turn from it, either on the right hand or the left, but must needs pass through the midst of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Then they of the city shut them out, and stopped up the gates with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Whereupon Judas sent unto them in peaceable manner, saying, Let us pass through your land to go into our own country, and none shall do you any hurt; we will only pass through on foot: howbeit they would not open unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Wherefore Judas commanded a proclamation to be made throughout the host, that every man should pitch his tent in the place where he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">So the soldiers pitched, and assaulted the city all that day and all that night, till at the length the city was delivered into his hands:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Who then slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and rased the city, and took the spoils thereof, and passed through the city over them that were slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">After this went they over Jordan into the great plain before Bethsan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And Judas gathered together those that came behind, and exhorted the people all the way through, till they came into the land of Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">So they went up to mount Sion with joy and gladness, where they offered burnt offerings, because not one of them were slain until they had returned in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Now what time as Judas and Jonathan were in the land of Galaad, and Simon his brother in Galilee before Ptolemais,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the garrisons, heard of the valiant acts and warlike deeds which they had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Wherefore they said, Let us also get us a name, and go fight against the heathen that are round about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">So when they had given charge unto the garrison that was with them, they went toward Jamnia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Then came Gorgias and his men out of the city to fight against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And so it was, that Joseph and Azaras were put to flight, and pursued unto the borders of Judea: and there were slain that day of the people of Israel about two thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Thus was there a great overthrow among the children of Israel, because they were not obedient unto Judas and his brethren, but thought to do some valiant act.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Moreover these men came not of the seed of those, by whose hand deliverance was given unto Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Howbeit the man Judas and his brethren were greatly renowned in the sight of all Israel, and of all the heathen, wheresoever their name was heard of;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Insomuch as the the people assembled unto them with joyful acclamations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Afterward went Judas forth with his brethren, and fought against the children of Esau in the land toward the south, where he smote Hebron, and the towns thereof, and pulled down the fortress of it, and burned the towers thereof round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">From thence he removed to go into the land of the Philistines, and passed through Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">At that time certain priests, desirous to shew their valour, were slain in battle, for that they went out to fight unadvisedly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">So Judas turned to Azotus in the land of the Philistines, and when he had pulled down their altars, and burned their carved images with fire, and spoiled their cities, he returned into the land of Judea.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">About that time king Antiochus travelling through the high countries heard say, that Elymais in the country of Persia was a city greatly renowned for riches, silver, and gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And that there was in it a very rich temple, wherein were coverings of gold, and breastplates, and shields, which Alexander, son of Philip, the Macedonian king, who reigned first among the Grecians, had left there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Wherefore he came and sought to take the city, and to spoil it; but he was not able, because they of the city, having had warning thereof,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Rose up against him in battle: so he fled, and departed thence with great heaviness, and returned to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover there came one who brought him tidings into Persia, that the armies, which went against the land of Judea, were put to flight:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And that Lysias, who went forth first with a great power was driven away of the Jews; and that they were made strong by the armour, and power, and store of spoils, which they had gotten of the armies, whom they had destroyed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Also that they had pulled down the abomination, which he had set up upon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high walls, as before, and his city Bethsura.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now when the king heard these words, he was astonished and sore moved: whereupon he laid him down upon his bed, and fell sick for grief, because it had not befallen him as he looked for.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there he continued many days: for his grief was ever more and more, and he made account that he should die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Wherefore he called for all his friends, and said unto them, The sleep is gone from mine eyes, and my heart faileth for very care.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I thought with myself, Into what tribulation am I come, and how great a flood of misery is it, wherein now I am! for I was bountiful and beloved in my power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But now I remember the evils that I did at Jerusalem, and that I took all the vessels of gold and silver that were therein, and sent to destroy the inhabitants of Judea without a cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I perceive therefore that for this cause these troubles are come upon me, and, behold, I perish through great grief in a strange land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then called he for Philip, one of his friends, who he made ruler over all his realm,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And gave him the crown, and his robe, and his signet, to the end he should bring up his son Antiochus, and nourish him up for the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So king Antiochus died there in the hundred forty and ninth year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now when Lysias knew that the king was dead, he set up Antiochus his son, whom he had brought up being young, to reign in his stead, and his name he called Eupator.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">About this time they that were in the tower shut up the Israelites round about the sanctuary, and sought always their hurt, and the strengthening of the heathen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Wherefore Judas, purposing to destroy them, called all the people together to besiege them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So they came together, and besieged them in the hundred and fiftieth year, and he made mounts for shot against them, and other engines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Howbeit certain of them that were besieged got forth, unto whom some ungodly men of Israel joined themselves:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they went unto the king, and said, How long will it be ere thou execute judgment, and avenge our brethren?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">We have been willing to serve thy father, and to do as he would have us, and to obey his commandments;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For which cause they of our nation besiege the tower, and are alienated from us: moreover as many of us as they could light on they slew, and spoiled our inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Neither have they stretched out their hand against us only, but also against their borders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And, behold, this day are they besieging the tower at Jerusalem, to take it: the sanctuary also and Bethsura have they fortified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Wherefore if thou dost not prevent them quickly, they will do the greater things than these, neither shalt thou be able to rule them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now when the king heard this, he was angry, and gathered together all his friends, and the captains of his army, and those that had charge of the horse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">There came also unto him from other kingdoms, and from isles of the sea, bands of hired soldiers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So that the number of his army was an hundred thousand footmen, and twenty thousand horsemen, and two and thirty elephants exercised in battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">These went through Idumea, and pitched against Bethsura, which they assaulted many days, making engines of war; but they of Bethsura came out, and burned them with fire, and fought valiantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Upon this Judas removed from the tower, and pitched in Bathzacharias, over against the king's camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the king rising very early marched fiercely with his host toward Bathzacharias, where his armies made them ready to battle, and sounded the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And to the end they might provoke the elephants to fight, they shewed them the blood of grapes and mulberries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Moreover they divided the beasts among the armies, and for every elephant they appointed a thousand men, armed with coats of mail, and with helmets of brass on their heads; and beside this, for every beast were ordained five hundred horsemen of the best.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">These were ready at every occasion: wheresoever the beast was, and whithersoever the beast went, they went also, neither departed they from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And upon the beasts were there strong towers of wood, which covered every one of them, and were girt fast unto them with devices: there were also upon every one two and thirty strong men, that fought upon them, beside the Indian that ruled him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">As for the remnant of the horsemen, they set them on this side and that side at the two parts of the host giving them signs what to do, and being harnessed all over amidst the ranks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, the mountains glistered therewith, and shined like lamps of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So part of the king's army being spread upon the high mountains, and part on the valleys below, they marched on safely and in order.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Wherefore all that heard the noise of their multitude, and the marching of the company, and the rattling of the harness, were moved: for the army was very great and mighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Then Judas and his host drew near, and entered into battle, and there were slain of the king's army six hundred men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Eleazar also, surnamed Savaran, perceiving that one of the beasts, armed with royal harness, was higher than all the rest, and supposing that the king was upon him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Put himself in jeopardy, to the end he might deliver his people, and get him a perpetual name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Wherefore he ran upon him courageously through the midst of the battle, slaying on the right hand and on the left, so that they were divided from him on both sides.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Which done, he crept under the elephant, and thrust him under, and slew him: whereupon the elephant fell down upon him, and there he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Howbeit the rest of the Jews seeing the strength of the king, and the violence of his forces, turned away from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then the king's army went up to Jerusalem to meet them, and the king pitched his tents against Judea, and against mount Sion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But with them that were in Bethsura he made peace: for they came out of the city, because they had no victuals there to endure the siege, it being a year of rest to the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">So the king took Bethsura, and set a garrison there to keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">As for the sanctuary, he besieged it many days: and set there artillery with engines and instruments to cast fire and stones, and pieces to cast darts and slings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Whereupon they also made engines against their engines, and held them battle a long season.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Yet at the last, their vessels being without victuals, (for that it was the seventh year, and they in Judea that were delivered from the Gentiles, had eaten up the residue of the store;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">There were but a few left in the sanctuary, because the famine did so prevail against them, that they were fain to disperse themselves, every man to his own place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">At that time Lysias heard say, that Philip, whom Antiochus the king, whiles he lived, had appointed to bring up his son Antiochus, that he might be king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Was returned out of Persia and Media, and the king's host also that went with him, and that he sought to take unto him the ruling of the affairs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Wherefore he went in all haste, and said to the king and the captains of the host and the company, We decay daily, and our victuals are but small, and the place we lay siege unto is strong, and the affairs of the kingdom lie upon us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Now therefore let us be friends with these men, and make peace with them, and with all their nation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And covenant with them, that they shall live after their laws, as they did before: for they are therefore displeased, and have done all these things, because we abolished their laws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">So the king and the princes were content: wherefore he sent unto them to make peace; and they accepted thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Also the king and the princes made an oath unto them: whereupon they went out of the strong hold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Then the king entered into mount Sion; but when he saw the strength of the place, he broke his oath that he had made, and gave commandment to pull down the wall round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Afterward departed he in all haste, and returned unto Antiochia, where he found Philip to be master of the city: so he fought against him, and took the city by force.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the hundred and one and fiftieth year Demetrius the son of Seleucus departed from Rome, and came up with a few men unto a city of the sea coast, and reigned there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And as he entered into the palace of his ancestors, so it was, that his forces had taken Antiochus and Lysias, to bring them unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Wherefore, when he knew it, he said, Let me not see their faces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So his host slew them. Now when Demetrius was set upon the throne of his kingdom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There came unto him all the wicked and ungodly men of Israel, having Alcimus, who was desirous to be high priest, for their captain:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they accused the people to the king, saying, Judas and his brethren have slain all thy friends, and driven us out of our own land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore send some man whom thou trustest, and let him go and see what havock he hath made among us, and in the king's land, and let him punish them with all them that aid them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the king chose Bacchides, a friend of the king, who ruled beyond the flood, and was a great man in the kingdom, and faithful to the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And him he sent with that wicked Alcimus, whom he made high priest, and commanded that he should take vengeance of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they departed, and came with a great power into the land of Judea, where they sent messengers to Judas and his brethren with peaceable words deceitfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But they gave no heed to their words; for they saw that they were come with a great power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then did there assemble unto Alcimus and Bacchides a company of scribes, to require justice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now the Assideans were the first among the children of Israel that sought peace of them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For said they, One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron is come with this army, and he will do us no wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So he spake unto them, peaceably, and sware unto them, saying, we will procure the harm neither of you nor your friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Whereupon they believed him: howbeit he took of them threescore men, and slew them in one day, according to the words which he wrote,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The flesh of thy saints have they cast out, and their blood have they shed round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Wherefore the fear and dread of them fell upon all the people, who said, There is neither truth nor righteousness in them; for they have broken the covenant and oath that they made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">After this, removed Bacchides from Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in Bezeth, where he sent and took many of the men that had forsaken him, and certain of the people also, and when he had slain them, he cast them into the great pit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then committed he the country to Alcimus, and left with him a power to aid him: so Bacchides went to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Alcimus contended for the high priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And unto him resorted all such as troubled the people, who, after they had gotten the land of Juda into their power, did much hurt in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now when Judas saw all the mischief that Alcimus and his company had done among the Israelites, even above the heathen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He went out into all the coasts of Judea round about, and took vengeance of them that had revolted from him, so that they durst no more go forth into the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">On the other side, when Alcimus saw that Judas and his company had gotten the upper hand, and knew that he was not able to abide their force, he went again to the king, and said all the worst of them that he could.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his honourable princes, a man that bare deadly hate unto Israel, with commandment to destroy the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a great force; and sent unto Judas and his brethren deceitfully with friendly words, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Let there be no battle between me and you; I will come with a few men, that I may see you in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He came therefore to Judas, and they saluted one another peaceably. Howbeit the enemies were prepared to take away Judas by violence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Which thing after it was known to Judas, to wit, that he came unto him with deceit, he was sore afraid of him, and would see his face no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Nicanor also, when he saw that his counsel was discovered, went out to fight against Judas beside Capharsalama:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Where there were slain of Nicanor's side about five thousand men, and the rest fled into the city of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">After this went Nicanor up to mount Sion, and there came out of the sanctuary certain of the priests and certain of the elders of the people, to salute him peaceably, and to shew him the burnt sacrifice that was offered for the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But he mocked them, and laughed at them, and abused them shamefully, and spake proudly,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And sware in his wrath, saying, Unless Judas and his host be now delivered into my hands, if ever I come again in safety, I will burn up this house: and with that he went out in a great rage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then the priests entered in, and stood before the altar and the temple, weeping, and saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Thou, O Lord, didst choose this house to be called by thy name, and to be a house of prayer and petition for thy people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Be avenged of this man and his host, and let them fall by the sword: remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to continue any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">So Nicanor went out of Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in Bethhoron, where an host out of Syria met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But Judas pitched in Adasa with three thousand men, and there he prayed, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">O Lord, when they that were sent from the king of the Assyrians blasphemed, thine angel went out, and smote an hundred fourscore and five thousand of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Even so destroy thou this host before us this day, that the rest may know that he hath spoken blasphemously against thy sanctuary, and judge thou him according to his wickedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">So the thirteenth day of the month Adar the hosts joined battle: but Nicanor's host was discomfited, and he himself was first slain in the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now when Nicanor's host saw that he was slain, they cast away their weapons, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then they pursued after them a day's journey, from Adasa unto Gazera, sounding an alarm after them with their trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Whereupon they came forth out of all the towns of Judea round about, and closed them in; so that they, turning back upon them that pursued them, were all slain with the sword, and not one of them was left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Afterwards they took the spoils, and the prey, and smote off Nicanors head, and his right hand, which he stretched out so proudly, and brought them away, and hanged them up toward Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">For this cause the people rejoiced greatly, and they kept that day a day of great gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Moreover they ordained to keep yearly this day, being the thirteenth of Adar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Thus the land of Juda was in rest a little while.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Judas had heard of the the Romans, that they were mighty and valiant men, and such as would lovingly accept all that joined themselves unto them, and make a league of amity with all that came unto them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And that they were men of great valour. It was told him also of their wars and noble acts which they had done among the Galatians, and how they had conquered them, and brought them under tribute;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And what they had done in the country of Spain, for the winning of the mines of the silver and gold which is there;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And that by their policy and patience they had conquered all the place, though it were very far from them; and the kings also that came against them from the uttermost part of the earth, till they had discomfited them, and given them a great overthrow, so that the rest did give them tribute every year:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Beside this, how they had discomfited in battle Philip, and Perseus, king of the Citims, with others that lifted up themselves against them, and had overcome them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">How also Antiochus the great king of Asia, that came against them in battle, having an hundred and twenty elephants, with horsemen, and chariots, and a very great army, was discomfited by them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And how they took him alive, and covenanted that he and such as reigned after him should pay a great tribute, and give hostages, and that which was agreed upon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the country of India, and Media and Lydia and of the goodliest countries, which they took of him, and gave to king Eumenes:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Moreover how the Grecians had determined to come and destroy them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And that they, having knowledge thereof sent against them a certain captain, and fighting with them slew many of them, and carried away captives their wives and their children, and spoiled them, and took possession of their lands, and pulled down their strong holds, and brought them to be their servants unto this day:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">It was told him besides, how they destroyed and brought under their dominion all other kingdoms and isles that at any time resisted them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But with their friends and such as relied upon them they kept amity: and that they had conquered kingdoms both far and nigh, insomuch as all that heard of their name were afraid of them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Also that, whom they would help to a kingdom, those reign; and whom again they would, they displace: finally, that they were greatly exalted:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Yet for all this none of them wore a crown or was clothed in purple, to be magnified thereby:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Moreover how they had made for themselves a senate house, wherein three hundred and twenty men sat in council daily, consulting alway for the people, to the end they might be well ordered:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And that they committed their government to one man every year, who ruled over all their country, and that all were obedient to that one, and that there was neither envy nor emmulation among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In consideration of these things, Judas chose Eupolemus the son of John, the son of Accos, and Jason the son of Eleazar, and sent them to Rome, to make a league of amity and confederacy with them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to intreat them that they would take the yoke from them; for they saw that the kingdom of the Grecians did oppress Israel with servitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They went therefore to Rome, which was a very great journey, and came into the senate, where they spake and said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Judas Maccabeus with his brethren, and the people of the Jews, have sent us unto you, to make a confederacy and peace with you, and that we might be registered your confederates and friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So that matter pleased the Romans well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And this is the copy of the epistle which the senate wrote back again in tables of brass, and sent to Jerusalem, that there they might have by them a memorial of peace and confederacy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Good success be to the Romans, and to the people of the Jews, by sea and by land for ever: the sword also and enemy be far from them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If there come first any war upon the Romans or any of their confederates throughout all their dominion,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The people of the Jews shall help them, as the time shall be appointed, with all their heart:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Neither shall they give any thing unto them that make war upon them, or aid them with victuals, weapons, money, or ships, as it hath seemed good unto the Romans; but they shall keep their covenants without taking any thing therefore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">In the same manner also, if war come first upon the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall help them with all their heart, according as the time shall be appointed them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Neither shall victuals be given to them that take part against them, or weapons, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed good to the Romans; but they shall keep their covenants, and that without deceit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">According to these articles did the Romans make a covenant with the people of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Howbeit if hereafter the one party or the other shall think to meet to add or diminish any thing, they may do it at their pleasures, and whatsoever they shall add or take away shall be ratified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And as touching the evils that Demetrius doeth to the Jews, we have written unto him, saying, Wherefore thou made thy yoke heavy upon our friends and confederates the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">If therefore they complain any more against thee, we will do them justice, and fight with thee by sea and by land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Furthermore, when Demetrius heard the Nicanor and his host were slain in battle, he sent Bacchides and Alcimus into the land of Judea the second time, and with them the chief strength of his host:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Who went forth by the way that leadeth to Galgala, and pitched their tents before Masaloth, which is in Arbela, and after they had won it, they slew much people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Also the first month of the hundred fifty and second year they encamped before Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">From whence they removed, and went to Berea, with twenty thousand footmen and two thousand horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Judas had pitched his tents at Eleasa, and three thousand chosen men with him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Who seeing the multitude of the other army to he so great were sore afraid; whereupon many conveyed themselves out of the host, insomuch as abode of them no more but eight hundred men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When Judas therefore saw that his host slipt away, and that the battle pressed upon him, he was sore troubled in mind, and much distressed, for that he had no time to gather them together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nevertheless unto them that remained he said, Let us arise and go up against our enemies, if peradventure we may be able to fight with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But they dehorted him, saying, We shall never be able: let us now rather save our lives, and hereafter we will return with our brethren, and fight against them: for we are but few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Judas said, God forbid that I should do this thing, and flee away from them: if our time be come, let us die manfully for our brethren, and let us not stain our honour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">With that the host of Bacchides removed out of their tents, and stood over against them, their horsemen being divided into two troops, and their slingers and archers going before the host and they that marched in the foreward were all mighty men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As for Bacchides, he was in the right wing: so the host drew near on the two parts, and sounded their trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They also of Judas' side, even they sounded their trumpets also, so that the earth shook at the noise of the armies, and the battle continued from morning till night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now when Judas perceived that Bacchides and the strength of his army were on the right side, he took with him all the hardy men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Who discomfited the right wing, and pursued them unto the mount Azotus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But when they of the left wing saw that they of the right wing were discomfited, they followed upon Judas and those that were with him hard at the heels from behind:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Whereupon there was a sore battle, insomuch as many were slain on both parts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Judas also was killed, and the remnant fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">THen Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother, and buried him in the sepulchre of his fathers in Modin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Moreover they bewailed him, and all Israel made great lamentation for him, and mourned many days, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">How is the valiant man fallen, that delivered Israel!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">As for the other things concerning Judas and his wars, and the noble acts which he did, and his greatness, they are not written: for they were very many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now after the death of Judas the wicked began to put forth their heads in all the coasts of Israel, and there arose up all such as wrought iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">In those days also was there a very great famine, by reason whereof the country revolted, and went with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Bacchides chose the wicked men, and made them lords of the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they made enquiry and search for Judas' friends, and brought them unto Bacchides, who took vengeance of them, and used them despitefully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So was there a great affliction in Israel, the like whereof was not since the time that a prophet was not seen among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For this cause all Judas' friends came together, and said unto Jonathan,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Since thy brother Judas died, we have no man like him to go forth against our enemies, and Bacchides, and against them of our nation that are adversaries to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now therefore we have chosen thee this day to be our prince and captain in his stead, that thou mayest fight our battles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Upon this Jonathan took the governance upon him at that time, and rose up instead of his brother Judas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But when Bacchides gat knowledge thereof, he sought for to slay him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then Jonathan, and Simon his brother, and all that were with him, perceiving that, fled into the wilderness of Thecoe, and pitched their tents by the water of the pool Asphar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Which when Bacchides understood, he came near to Jordan with all his host upon the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Now Jonathan had sent his brother John, a captain of the people, to pray his friends the Nabathites, that they might leave with them their carriage, which was much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But the children of Jambri came out of Medaba, and took John, and all that he had, and went their way with it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">After this came word to Jonathan and Simon his brother, that the children of Jambri made a great marriage, and were bringing the bride from Nadabatha with a great train, as being the daughter of one of the great princes of Chanaan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Therefore they remembered John their brother, and went up, and hid themselves under the covert of the mountain:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Where they lifted up their eyes, and looked, and, behold, there was much ado and great carriage: and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends and brethren, to meet them with drums, and instruments of musick, and many weapons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then Jonathan and they that were with him rose up against them from the place where they lay in ambush, and made a slaughter of them in such sort, as many fell down dead, and the remnant fled into the mountain, and they took all their spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Thus was the marriage turned into mourning, and the noise of their melody into lamentation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So when they had avenged fully the blood of their brother, they turned again to the marsh of Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Now when Bacchides heard hereof, he came on the sabbath day unto the banks of Jordan with a great power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then Jonathan said to his company, Let us go up now and fight for our lives, for it standeth not with us to day, as in time past:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">For, behold, the battle is before us and behind us, and the water of Jordan on this side and that side, the marsh likewise and wood, neither is there place for us to turn aside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Wherefore cry ye now unto heaven, that ye may be delivered from the hand of your enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">With that they joined battle, and Jonathan stretched forth his hand to smite Bacchides, but he turned back from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then Jonathan and they that were with him leapt into Jordan, and swam over unto the other bank: howbeit the other passed not over Jordan unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">So there were slain of Bacchides' side that day about a thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Afterward returned Bacchides to Jerusalem and repaired the strong cites in Judea; the fort in Jericho, and Emmaus, and Bethhoron, and Bethel, and Thamnatha, Pharathoni, and Taphon, these did he strengthen with high walls, with gates and with bars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And in them he set a garrison, that they might work malice upon Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">He fortified also the city Bethsura, and Gazera, and the tower, and put forces in them, and provision of victuals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Besides, he took the chief men's sons in the country for hostages, and put them into the tower at Jerusalem to be kept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Moreover in the hundred fifty and third year, in the second month, Alcimus commanded that the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary should be pulled down; he pulled down also the works of the prophets</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And as he began to pull down, even at that time was Alcimus plagued, and his enterprizes hindered: for his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, so that he could no more speak any thing, nor give order concerning his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">So Alcimus died at that time with great torment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Now when Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he returned to the king: whereupon the land of Judea was in rest two years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Then all the ungodly men held a council, saying, Behold, Jonathan and his company are at ease, and dwell without care: now therefore we will bring Bacchides hither, who shall take them all in one night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">So they went and consulted with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Then removed he, and came with a great host, and sent letters privily to his adherents in Judea, that they should take Jonathan and those that were with him: howbeit they could not, because their counsel was known unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Wherefore they took of the men of the country, that were authors of that mischief, about fifty persons, and slew them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Afterward Jonathan, and Simon, and they that were with him, got them away to Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness, and they repaired the decays thereof, and made it strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Which thing when Bacchides knew, he gathered together all his host, and sent word to them that were of Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Then went he and laid siege against Bethbasi; and they fought against it a long season and made engines of war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">But Jonathan left his brother Simon in the city, and went forth himself into the country, and with a certain number went he forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">And he smote Odonarkes and his brethren, and the children of Phasiron in their tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">And when he began to smite them, and came up with his forces, Simon and his company went out of the city, and burned up the engines of war,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">And fought against Bacchides, who was discomfited by them, and they afflicted him sore: for his counsel and travail was in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Wherefore he was very wroth at the wicked men that gave him counsel to come into the country, inasmuch as he slew many of them, and purposed to return into his own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">Whereof when Jonathan had knowledge, he sent ambassadors unto him, to the end he should make peace with him, and deliver them the prisoners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">Which thing he accepted, and did according to his demands, and sware unto him that he would never do him harm all the days of his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">When therefore he had restored unto him the prisoners that he had taken aforetime out of the land of Judea, he returned and went his way into his own land, neither came he any more into their borders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">Thus the sword ceased from Israel: but Jonathan dwelt at Machmas, and began to govern the people; and he destroyed the ungodly men out of Israel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the hundred and sixtieth year Alexander, the son of Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes, went up and took Ptolemais: for the people had received him, by means whereof he reigned there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now when king Demetrius heard thereof, he gathered together an exceeding great host, and went forth against him to fight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Moreover Demetrius sent letters unto Jonathan with loving words, so as he magnified him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For said he, Let us first make peace with him, before he join with Alexander against us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Else he will remember all the evils that we have done against him, and against his brethren and his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherefore he gave him authority to gather together an host, and to provide weapons, that he might aid him in battle: he commanded also that the hostages that were in the tower should be delivered him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then came Jonathan to Jerusalem, and read the letters in the audience of all the people, and of them that were in the tower:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Who were sore afraid, when they heard that the king had given him authority to gather together an host.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Whereupon they of the tower delivered their hostages unto Jonathan, and he delivered them unto their parents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This done, Jonathan settled himself in Jerusalem, and began to build and repair the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he commanded the workmen to build the walls and the mount Sion and about with square stones for fortification; and they did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the strangers, that were in the fortresses which Bacchides had built, fled away;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Insomuch as every man left his place, and went into his own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Only at Bethsura certain of those that had forsaken the law and the commandments remained still: for it was their place of refuge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now when king Alexander had heard what promises Demetrius had sent unto Jonathan: when also it was told him of the battles and noble acts which he and his brethren had done, and of the pains that they had endured,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He said, Shall we find such another man? now therefore we will make him our friend and confederate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Upon this he wrote a letter, and sent it unto him, according to these words, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">King Alexander to his brother Jonathan sendeth greeting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">We have heard of thee, that thou art a man of great power, and meet to be our friend.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wherefore now this day we ordain thee to be the high priest of thy nation, and to be called the king's friend; (and therewithal he sent him a purple robe and a crown of gold:) and require thee to take our part, and keep friendship with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So in the seventh month of the hundred and sixtieth year, at the feast of the tabernacles, Jonathan put on the holy robe, and gathered together forces, and provided much armour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Whereof when Demetrius heard, he was very sorry, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">What have we done, that Alexander hath prevented us in making amity with the Jews to strengthen himself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I also will write unto them words of encouragement, and promise them dignities and gifts, that I may have their aid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He sent unto them therefore to this effect: King Demetrius unto the people of the Jews sendeth greeting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Whereas ye have kept covenants with us, and continued in our friendship, not joining yourselves with our enemies, we have heard hereof, and are glad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Wherefore now continue ye still to be faithful unto us, and we will well recompense you for the things ye do in our behalf,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And will grant you many immunities, and give you rewards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And now do I free you, and for your sake I release all the Jews, from tributes, and from the customs of salt, and from crown taxes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And from that which appertaineth unto me to receive for the third part or the seed, and the half of the fruit of the trees, I release it from this day forth, so that they shall not be taken of the land of Judea, nor of the three governments which are added thereunto out of the country of Samaria and Galilee, from this day forth for evermore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Let Jerusalem also be holy and free, with the borders thereof, both from tenths and tributes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And as for the tower which is at Jerusalem, I yield up authority over it, and give the high priest, that he may set in it such men as he shall choose to keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Moreover I freely set at liberty every one of the Jews, that were carried captives out of the land of Judea into any part of my kingdom, and I will that all my officers remit the tributes even of their cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Furthermore I will that all the feasts, and sabbaths, and new moons, and solemn days, and the three days before the feast, and the three days after the feast shall be all of immunity and freedom for all the Jews in my realm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Also no man shall have authority to meddle with or to molest any of them in any matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">I will further, that there be enrolled among the king's forces about thirty thousand men of the Jews, unto whom pay shall be given, as belongeth to all king's forces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And of them some shall be placed in the king's strong holds, of whom also some shall be set over the affairs of the kingdom, which are of trust: and I will that their overseers and governors be of themselves, and that they live after their own laws, even as the king hath commanded in the land of Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And concerning the three governments that are added to Judea from the country of Samaria, let them be joined with Judea, that they may be reckoned to be under one, nor bound to obey other authority than the high priest's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">As for Ptolemais, and the land pertaining thereto, I give it as a free gift to the sanctuary at Jerusalem for the necessary expences of the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Moreover I give every year fifteen thousand shekels of silver out of the king's accounts from the places appertaining.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And all the overplus, which the officers payed not in as in former time, from henceforth shall be given toward the works of the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And beside this, the five thousand shekels of silver, which they took from the uses of the temple out of the accounts year by year, even those things shall be released, because they appertain to the priests that minister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And whosoever they be that flee unto the temple at Jerusalem, or be within the liberties hereof, being indebted unto the king, or for any other matter, let them be at liberty, and all that they have in my realm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For the building also and repairing of the works of the sanctuary expences shall be given of the king's accounts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Yea, and for the building of the walls of Jerusalem, and the fortifying thereof round about, expences shall be given out of the king's accounts, as also for the building of the walls in Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Now when Jonathan and the people heard these words, they gave no credit unto them, nor received them, because they remembered the great evil that he had done in Israel; for he had afflicted them very sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">But with Alexander they were well pleased, because he was the first that entreated of true peace with them, and they were confederate with him always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then gathered king Alexander great forces, and camped over against Demetrius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And after the two kings had joined battle, Demetrius' host fled: but Alexander followed after him, and prevailed against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And he continued the battle very sore until the sun went down: and that day was Demetrius slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Afterward Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemee king of Egypt with a message to this effect:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Forasmuch as I am come again to my realm, and am set in the throne of my progenitors, and have gotten the dominion, and overthrown Demetrius, and recovered our country;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">For after I had joined battle with him, both he and his host was discomfited by us, so that we sit in the throne of his kingdom:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Now therefore let us make a league of amity together, and give me now thy daughter to wife: and I will be thy son in law, and will give both thee and her as according to thy dignity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Then Ptolemee the king gave answer, saying, Happy be the day wherein thou didst return into the land of thy fathers, and satest in the throne of their kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And now will I do to thee, as thou hast written: meet me therefore at Ptolemais, that we may see one another; for I will marry my daughter to thee according to thy desire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">So Ptolemee went out of Egypt with his daughter Cleopatra, and they came unto Ptolemais in the hundred threescore and second year:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Where king Alexander meeting him, he gave unto him his daughter Cleopatra, and celebrated her marriage at Ptolemais with great glory, as the manner of kings is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Now king Alexander had written unto Jonathan, that he should come and meet him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Who thereupon went honourably to Ptolemais, where he met the two kings, and gave them and their friends silver and gold, and many presents, and found favour in their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">At that time certain pestilent fellows of Israel, men of a wicked life, assembled themselves against him, to accuse him: but the king would not hear them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Yea more than that, the king commanded to take off his garments, and clothe him in purple: and they did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">And he made him sit by himself, and said into his princes, Go with him into the midst of the city, and make proclamation, that no man complain against him of any matter, and that no man trouble him for any manner of cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Now when his accusers saw that he was honored according to the proclamation, and clothed in purple, they fled all away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">So the king honoured him, and wrote him among his chief friends, and made him a duke, and partaker of his dominion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">Afterward Jonathan returned to Jerusalem with peace and gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Furthermore in the; hundred threescore and fifth year came Demetrius son of Demetrius out of Crete into the land of his fathers:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">Whereof when king Alexander heard tell, he was right sorry, and returned into Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Then Demetrius made Apollonius the governor of Celosyria his general, who gathered together a great host, and camped in Jamnia, and sent unto Jonathan the high priest, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">Thou alone liftest up thyself against us, and I am laughed to scorn for thy sake, and reproached: and why dost thou vaunt thy power against us in the mountains?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">Now therefore, if thou trustest in thine own strength, come down to us into the plain field, and there let us try the matter together: for with me is the power of the cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">Ask and learn who I am, and the rest that take our part, and they shall tell thee that thy foot is not able to to flight in their own land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">Wherefore now thou shalt not be able to abide the horsemen and so great a power in the plain, where is neither stone nor flint, nor place to flee unto.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">So when Jonathan heard these words of Apollonius, he was moved in his mind, and choosing ten thousand men he went out of Jerusalem, where Simon his brother met him for to help him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">And he pitched his tents against Joppa: but; they of Joppa shut him out of the city, because Apollonius had a garrison there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="76">Then Jonathan laid siege unto it: whereupon they of the city let him in for fear: and so Jonathan won Joppa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="77">Whereof when Apollonius heard, he took three thousand horsemen, with a great host of footmen, and went to Azotus as one that journeyed, and therewithal drew him forth into the plain. because he had a great number of horsemen, in whom he put his trust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="78">Then Jonathan followed after him to Azotus, where the armies joined battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="79">Now Apollonius had left a thousand horsemen in ambush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="80">And Jonathan knew that there was an ambushment behind him; for they had compassed in his host, and cast darts at the people, from morning till evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="81">But the people stood still, as Jonathan had commanded them: and so the enemies' horses were tired.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="82">Then brought Simon forth his host, and set them against the footmen, (for the horsemen were spent) who were discomfited by him, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="83">The horsemen also, being scattered in the field, fled to Azotus, and went into Bethdagon, their idol's temple, for safety.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="84">But Jonathan set fire on Azotus, and the cities round about it, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, with them that were fled into it, he burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="85">Thus there were burned and slain with the sword well nigh eight thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="86">And from thence Jonathan removed his host, and camped against Ascalon, where the men of the city came forth, and met him with great pomp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="87">After this returned Jonathan and his host unto Jerusalem, having any spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="88">Now when king ALexander heard these things, he honoured Jonathan yet more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="89">And sent him a buckle of gold, as the use is to be given to such as are of the king's blood: he gave him also Accaron with the borders thereof in possession.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the king of Egypt gathered together a great host, like the sand that lieth upon the sea shore, and many ships, and went about through deceit to get Alexander's kingdom, and join it to his own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Whereupon he took his journey into Spain in peaceable manner, so as they of the cities opened unto him, and met him: for king Alexander had commanded them so to do, because he was his brother in law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now as Ptolemee entered into the cities, he set in every one of them a garrison of soldiers to keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he came near to Azotus, they shewed him the temple of Dagon that was burnt, and Azotus and the suburbs thereof that were destroyed, and the bodies that were cast abroad and them that he had burnt in the battle; for they had made heaps of them by the way where he should pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Also they told the king whatsoever Jonathan had done, to the intent he might blame him: but the king held his peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Jonathan met the king with great pomp at Joppa, where they saluted one another, and lodged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Afterward Jonathan, when he had gone with the king to the river called Eleutherus, returned again to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">King Ptolemee therefore, having gotten the dominion of the cities by the sea unto Seleucia upon the sea coast, imagined wicked counsels against Alexander.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Whereupon he sent ambasadors unto king Demetrius, saying, Come, let us make a league betwixt us, and I will give thee my daughter whom Alexander hath, and thou shalt reign in thy father's kingdom:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For I repent that I gave my daughter unto him, for he sought to slay me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus did he slander him, because he was desirous of his kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Wherefore he took his daughter from him, and gave her to Demetrius, and forsook Alexander, so that their hatred was openly known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Ptolemee entered into Antioch, where he set two crowns upon his head, the crown of Asia, and of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the mean season was king Alexander in Cilicia, because those that dwelt in those parts had revolted from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when Alexander heard of this, he came to war against him: whereupon king Ptolemee brought forth his host, and met him with a mighty power, and put him to flight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Alexander fled into Arabia there to be defended; but king Ptolemee was exalted:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander's head, and sent it unto Ptolemee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">King Ptolemee also died the third day after, and they that were in the strong holds were slain one of another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">By this means Demetrius reigned in the hundred threescore and seventh year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">At the same time Jonathan gathered together them that were in Judea to take the tower that was in Jerusalem: and he made many engines of war against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then came ungodly persons, who hated their own people, went unto the king, and told him that Jonathan besieged the tower,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Whereof when he heard, he was angry, and immediately removing, he came to Ptolemais, and wrote unto Jonathan, that he should not lay siege to the tower, but come and speak with him at Ptolemais in great haste.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Nevertheless Jonathan, when he heard this, commanded to besiege it still: and he chose certain of the elders of Israel and the priests, and put himself in peril;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And took silver and gold, and raiment, and divers presents besides, and went to Ptolemais unto the king, where he found favour in his sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And though certain ungodly men of the people had made complaints against him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Yet the king entreated him as his predecessors had done before, and promoted him in the sight of all his friends,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And confirmed him in the high priesthood, and in all the honours that he had before, and gave him preeminence among his chief friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Jonathan desired the king, that he would make Judea free from tribute, as also the three governments, with the country of Samaria; and he promised him three hundred talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So the king consented, and wrote letters unto Jonathan of all these things after this manner:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">King Demetrius unto his brother Jonathan, and unto the nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">We send you here a copy of the letter which we did write unto our cousin Lasthenes concerning you, that ye might see it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">King Demetrius unto his father Lasthenes sendeth greeting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">We are determined to do good to the people of the Jews, who are our friends, and keep covenants with us, because of their good will toward us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Wherefore we have ratified unto them the borders of Judea, with the three governments of Apherema and Lydda and Ramathem, that are added unto Judea from the country of Samaria, and all things appertaining unto them, for all such as do sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the payments which the king received of them yearly aforetime out of the fruits of the earth and of trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And as for other things that belong unto us, of the tithes and customs pertaining unto us, as also the saltpits, and the crown taxes, which are due unto us, we discharge them of them all for their relief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And nothing hereof shall be revoked from this time forth for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now therefore see that thou make a copy of these things, and let it be delivered unto Jonathan, and set upon the holy mount in a conspicuous place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">After this, when king Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him, and that no resistance was made against him, he sent away all his forces, every one to his own place, except certain bands of strangers, whom he had gathered from the isles of the heathen: wherefore all the forces of his fathers hated him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Moreover there was one Tryphon, that had been of Alexander's part afore, who, seeing that all the host murmured against Demetrius, went to Simalcue the Arabian that brought up Antiochus the young son of Alexander,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And lay sore upon him to deliver him this young Antiochus, that he might reign in his father's stead: he told him therefore all that Demetrius had done, and how his men of war were at enmity with him, and there he remained a long season.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">In the mean time Jonathan sent unto king Demetrius, that he would cast those of the tower out of Jerusalem, and those also in the fortresses: for they fought against Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So Demetrius sent unto Jonathan, saying, I will not only do this for thee and thy people, but I will greatly honour thee and thy nation, if opportunity serve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Now therefore thou shalt do well, if thou send me men to help me; for all my forces are gone from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Upon this Jonathan sent him three thousand strong men unto Antioch: and when they came to the king, the king was very glad of their coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Howbeit they that were of the city gathered themselves together into the midst of the city, to the number of an hundred and twenty thousand men, and would have slain the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Wherefore the king fled into the court, but they of the city kept the passages of the city, and began to fight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Then the king called to the Jews for help, who came unto him all at once, and dispersing themselves through the city slew that day in the city to the number of an hundred thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Also they set fire on the city, and gat many spoils that day, and delivered the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">So when they of the city saw that the Jews had got the city as they would, their courage was abated: wherefore they made supplication to the king, and cried, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Grant us peace, and let the Jews cease from assaulting us and the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">With that they cast away their weapons, and made peace; and the Jews were honoured in the sight of the king, and in the sight of all that were in his realm; and they returned to Jerusalem, having great spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">So king Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Nevertheless he dissembled in all that ever he spake, and estranged himself from Jonathan, neither rewarded he him according to the benefits which he had received of him, but troubled him very sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">After this returned Tryphon, and with him the young child Antiochus, who reigned, and was crowned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Then there gathered unto him all the men of war, whom Demetrius had put away, and they fought against Demetrius, who turned his back and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Moreover Tryphon took the elephants, and won Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">At that time young Antiochus wrote unto Jonathan, saying, I confirm thee in the high priesthood, and appoint thee ruler over the four governments, and to be one of the king's friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Upon this he sent him golden vessels to be served in, and gave him leave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple, and to wear a golden buckle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">His brother Simon also he made captain from the place called The ladder of Tyrus unto the borders of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Then Jonathan went forth, and passed through the cities beyond the water, and all the forces of Syria gathered themselves unto him for to help him: and when he came to Ascalon, they of the city met him honourably.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">From whence he went to Gaza, but they of Gaza shut him out; wherefore he laid siege unto it, and burned the suburbs thereof with fire, and spoiled them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Afterward, when they of Gaza made supplication unto Jonathan, he made peace with them, and took the sons of their chief men for hostages, and sent them to Jerusalem, and passed through the country unto Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Now when Jonathan heard that Demetrius' princes were come to Cades, which is in Galilee, with a great power, purposing to remove him out of the country,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">He went to meet them, and left Simon his brother in the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then Simon encamped against Bethsura and fought against it a long season, and shut it up:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">But they desired to have peace with him, which he granted them, and then put them out from thence, and took the city, and set a garrison in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">As for Jonathan and his host, they pitched at the water of Gennesar, from whence betimes in the morning they gat them to the plain of Nasor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">And, behold, the host of strangers met them in the plain, who, having laid men in ambush for him in the mountains, came themselves over against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">So when they that lay in ambush rose out of their places and joined battle, all that were of Jonathan's side fled;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">Insomuch as there was not one of them left, except Mattathias the son of Absalom, and Judas the son of Calphi, the captains of the host.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">Then Jonathan rent his clothes, and cast earth upon his head, and prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">Afterwards turning again to battle, he put them to flight, and so they ran away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">Now when his own men that were fled saw this, they turned again unto him, and with him pursued them to Cades, even unto their own tents, and there they camped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">So there were slain of the heathen that day about three thousand men: but Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Jonathan saw that time served him, he chose certain men, and sent them to Rome, for to confirm and renew the friendship that they had with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He sent letters also to the Lacedemonians, and to other places, for the same purpose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So they went unto Rome, and entered into the senate, and said, Jonathan the high priest, and the people of the Jews, sent us unto you, to the end ye should renew the friendship, which ye had with them, and league, as in former time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Upon this the Romans gave them letters unto the governors of every place that they should bring them into the land of Judea peaceably.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And this is the copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the Lacedemonians:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jonathan the high priest, and the elders of the nation, and the priests, and the other of the Jews, unto the Lacedemonians their brethren send greeting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There were letters sent in times past unto Onias the high priest from Darius, who reigned then among you, to signify that ye are our brethren, as the copy here underwritten doth specify.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">At which time Onias entreated the ambassador that was sent honourably, and received the letters, wherein declaration was made of the league and friendship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore we also, albeit we need none of these things, that we have the holy books of scripture in our hands to comfort us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Have nevertheless attempted to send unto you for the renewing of brotherhood and friendship, lest we should become strangers unto you altogether: for there is a long time passed since ye sent unto us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our feasts, and other convenient days, do remember you in the sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as reason is, and as it becometh us to think upon our brethren:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And we are right glad of your honour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As for ourselves, we have had great troubles and wars on every side, forsomuch as the kings that are round about us have fought against us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Howbeit we would not be troublesome unto you, nor to others of our confederates and friends, in these wars:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we have help from heaven that succoureth us, so as we are delivered from our enemies, and our enemies are brought under foot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For this cause we chose Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater he son of Jason, and sent them unto the Romans, to renew the amity that we had with them, and the former league.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">We commanded them also to go unto you, and to salute and to deliver you our letters concerning the renewing of our brotherhood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Wherefore now ye shall do well to give us an answer thereto.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the copy of the letters which Oniares sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Areus king of the Lacedemonians to Onias the high priest, greeting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">It is found in writing, that the Lacedemonians and Jews are brethren, and that they are of the stock of Abraham:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now therefore, since this is come to our knowledge, ye shall do well to write unto us of your prosperity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">We do write back again to you, that your cattle and goods are our's, and our's are your's We do command therefore our ambassadors to make report unto you on this wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now when Jonathan heard that Demebius' princes were come to fight against him with a greater host than afore,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He removed from Jerusalem, and met them in the land of Amathis: for he gave them no respite to enter his country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He sent spies also unto their tents, who came again, and told him that they were appointed to come upon them in the night season.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Wherefore so soon as the sun was down, Jonathan commanded his men to watch, and to be in arms, that all the night long they might be ready to fight: also he sent forth centinels round about the host.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But when the adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle, they feared, and trembled in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Howbeit Jonathan and his company knew it not till the morning: for they saw the lights burning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then Jonathan pursued after them, but overtook them not: for they were gone over the river Eleutherus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Wherefore Jonathan turned to the Arabians, who were called Zabadeans, and smote them, and took their spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And removing thence, he came to Damascus, and so passed through all the country,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Simon also went forth, and passed through the country unto Ascalon, and the holds there adjoining, from whence he turned aside to Joppa, and won it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For he had heard that they would deliver the hold unto them that took Demetrius' part; wherefore he set a garrison there to keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">After this came Jonathan home again, and calling the elders of the people together, he consulted with them about building strong holds in Judea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And making the walls of Jerusalem higher, and raising a great mount between the tower and the city, for to separate it from the city, that so it might be alone, that men might neither sell nor buy in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Upon this they came together to build up the city, forasmuch as part of the wall toward the brook on the east side was fallen down, and they repaired that which was called Caphenatha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Simon also set up Adida in Sephela, and made it strong with gates and bars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now Tryphon went about to get the kingdom of Asia, and to kill Antiochus the king, that he might set the crown upon his own head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Howbeit he was afraid that Jonathan would not suffer him, and that he would fight against him; wherefore he sought a way how to take Jonathan, that he might kill him. So he removed, and came to Bethsan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for the battle, and came to Bethsan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Now when Tryphon saw Jonathan came with so great a force, he durst not stretch his hand against him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But received him honourably, and commended him unto all his friends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his men of war to be as obedient unto him, as to himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Unto Jonathan also he said, Why hast thou brought all this people to so great trouble, seeing there is no war betwixt us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Therefore send them now home again, and choose a few men to wait on thee, and come thou with me to Ptolemais, for I will give it thee, and the rest of the strong holds and forces, and all that have any charge: as for me, I will return and depart: for this is the cause of my coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">So Jonathan believing him did as he bade him, and sent away his host, who went into the land of Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And with himself he retained but three thousand men, of whom he sent two thousand into Galilee, and one thousand went with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates and took him, and all them that came with him they slew with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Then sent Tryphon an host of footmen and horsemen into Galilee, and into the great plain, to destroy all Jonathan's company.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But when they knew that Jonathan and they that were with him were taken and slain, they encouraged one another; and went close together, prepared to fight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">They therefore that followed upon them, perceiving that they were ready to fight for their lives, turned back again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Whereupon they all came into the land of Judea peaceably, and there they bewailed Jonathan, and them that were with him, and they were sore afraid; wherefore all Israel made great lamentation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Then all the heathen that were round about then sought to destroy them: for said they, They have no captain, nor any to help them: now therefore let us make war upon them, and take away their memorial from among men.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Simon heard that Tryphon had gathered together a great host to invade the land of Judea, and destroy it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And saw that the people was in great trembling and fear, he went up to Jerusalem, and gathered the people together,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And gave them exhortation, saying, Ye yourselves know what great things I, and my brethren, and my father's house, have done for the laws and the sanctuary, the battles also and troubles which we have seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">By reason whereof all my brethren are slain for Israel's sake, and I am left alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now therefore be it far from me, that I should spare mine own life in any time of trouble: for I am no better than my brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Doubtless I will avenge my nation, and the sanctuary, and our wives, and our children: for all the heathen are gathered to destroy us of very malice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now as soon as the people heard these words, their spirit revived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they answered with a loud voice, saying, Thou shalt be our leader instead of Judas and Jonathan thy brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Fight thou our battles, and whatsoever, thou commandest us, that will we do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So then he gathered together all the men of war, and made haste to finish the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Also he sent Jonathan the son of Absolom, and with him a great power, to Joppa: who casting out them that were therein remained there in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Tryphon removed from Ptolemaus with a great power to invade the land of Judea, and Jonathan was with him in ward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Simon pitched his tents at Adida, over against the plain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now when Tryphon knew that Simon was risen up instead of his brother Jonathan, and meant to join battle with him, he sent messengers unto him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Whereas we have Jonathan thy brother in hold, it is for money that he is owing unto the king's treasure, concerning the business that was committed unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Wherefore now send an hundred talents of silver, and two of his sons for hostages, that when he is at liberty he may not revolt from us, and we will let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Hereupon Simon, albeit he perceived that they spake deceitfully unto him yet sent he the money and the children, lest peradventure he should procure to himself great hatred of the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Who might have said, Because I sent him not the money and the children, therefore is Jonathan dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So he sent them the children and the hundred talents: howbeit Tryphon dissembled neither would he let Jonathan go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And after this came Tryphon to invade the land, and destroy it, going round about by the way that leadeth unto Adora: but Simon and his host marched against him in every place, wheresoever he went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now they that were in the tower sent messengers unto Tryphon, to the end that he should hasten his coming unto them by the wilderness, and send them victuals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Wherefore Tryphon made ready all his horsemen to come that night: but there fell a very great snow, by reason whereof he came not. So he departed, and came into the country of Galaad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when he came near to Bascama he slew Jonathan, who was buried there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Afterward Tryphon returned and went into his own land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then sent Simon, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried them in Modin, the city of his fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And all Israel made great lamentation for him, and bewailed him many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Simon also built a monument upon the sepulchre of his father and his brethren, and raised it aloft to the sight, with hewn stone behind and before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Moreover he set up seven pyramids, one against another, for his father, and his mother, and his four brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And in these he made cunning devices, about the which he set great pillars, and upon the pillars he made all their armour for a perpetual memory, and by the armour ships carved, that they might be seen of all that sail on the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This is the sepulchre which he made at Modin, and it standeth yet unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now Tryphon dealt deceitfully with the young king Antiochus, and slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And he reigned in his stead, and crowned himself king of Asia, and brought a great calamity upon the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then Simon built up the strong holds in Judea, and fenced them about with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and bars, and laid up victuals therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Moreover Simon chose men, and sent to king Demetrius, to the end he should give the land an immunity, because all that Tryphon did was to spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Unto whom king Demetrius answered and wrote after this manner:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">King Demetrius unto Simon the high priest, and friend of kings, as also unto the elders and nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The golden crown, and the scarlet robe, which ye sent unto us, we have received: and we are ready to make a stedfast peace with you, yea, and to write unto our officers, to confirm the immunities which we have granted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And whatsoever covenants we have made with you shall stand; and the strong holds, which ye have builded, shall be your own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">As for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, we forgive it, and the crown tax also, which ye owe us: and if there were any other tribute paid in Jerusalem, it shall no more be paid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And look who are meet among you to be in our court, let then be enrolled, and let there be peace betwixt us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Thus the yoke of the heathen was taken away from Israel in the hundred and seventieth year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Then the people of Israel began to write in their instruments and contracts, In the first year of Simon the high priest, the governor and leader of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">In those days Simon camped against Gaza and besieged it round about; he made also an engine of war, and set it by the city, and battered a certain tower, and took it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And they that were in the engine leaped into the city; whereupon there was a great uproar in the city:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Insomuch as the people of the city rent their clothes, and climbed upon the walls with their wives and children, and cried with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And they said, Deal not with us according to our wickedness, but according to thy mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">So Simon was appeased toward them, and fought no more against them, but put them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein the idols were, and so entered into it with songs and thanksgiving.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Yea, he put all uncleanness out of it, and placed such men there as would keep the law, and made it stronger than it was before, and built therein a dwellingplace for himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">They also of the tower in Jerusalem were kept so strait, that they could neither come forth, nor go into the country, nor buy, nor sell: wherefore they were in great distress for want of victuals, and a great number of them perished through famine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Then cried they to Simon, beseeching him to be at one with them: which thing he granted them; and when he had put them out from thence, he cleansed the tower from pollutions:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month in the hundred seventy and first year, with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and with harps, and cymbals, and with viols, and hymns, and songs: because there was destroyed a great enemy out of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">He ordained also that that day should be kept every year with gladness. Moreover the hill of the temple that was by the tower he made stronger than it was, and there he dwelt himself with his company.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And when Simon saw that John his son was a valiant man, he made him captain of all the hosts; and he dwelt in Gazera.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now in the hundred threescore and twelfth year king Demetrius gathered his forces together, and went into Media to get him help to fight against Tryphone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But when Arsaces, the king of Persia and Media, heard that Demetrius was entered within his borders, he sent one of his princes to take him alive:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Who went and smote the host of Demetrius, and took him, and brought him to Arsaces, by whom he was put in ward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As for the land of Judea, that was quiet all the days of Simon; for he sought the good of his nation in such wise, as that evermore his authority and honour pleased them well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as he was honourable in all his acts, so in this, that he took Joppa for an haven, and made an entrance to the isles of the sea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And enlarged the bounds of his nation, and recovered the country,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And gathered together a great number of captives, and had the dominion of Gazera, and Bethsura, and the tower, out of the which he took all uncleaness, neither was there any that resisted him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then did they till their ground in peace, and the earth gave her increase, and the trees of the field their fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The ancient men sat all in the streets, communing together of good things, and the young men put on glorious and warlike apparel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He provided victuals for the cities, and set in them all manner of munition, so that his honourable name was renowned unto the end of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He made peace in the land, and Israel rejoiced with great joy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For every man sat under his vine and his fig tree, and there was none to fray them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither was there any left in the land to fight against them: yea, the kings themselves were overthrown in those days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Moreover he strengthened all those of his people that were brought low: the law he searched out; and every contemner of the law and wicked person he took away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He beautified the sanctuary, and multiplied vessels of the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now when it was heard at Rome, and as far as Sparta, that Jonathan was dead, they were very sorry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But as soon as they heard that his brother Simon was made high priest in his stead, and ruled the country, and the cities therein:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They wrote unto him in tables of brass, to renew the friendship and league which they had made with Judas and Jonathan his brethren:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Which writings were read before the congregation at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And this is the copy of the letters that the Lacedemonians sent; The rulers of the Lacedemonians, with the city, unto Simon the high priest, and the elders, and priests, and residue of the people of the Jews, our brethren, send greeting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The ambassadors that were sent unto our people certified us of your glory and honour: wherefore we were glad of their coming,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And did register the things that they spake in the council of the people in this manner; Numenius son of Antiochus, and Antipater son of Jason, the Jews' ambassadors, came unto us to renew the friendship they had with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it pleased the people to entertain the men honourably, and to put the copy of their ambassage in publick records, to the end the people of the Lacedemonians might have a memorial thereof: furthermore we have written a copy thereof unto Simon the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">After this Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a great shield of gold of a thousand pound weight to confirm the league with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Whereof when the people heard, they said, What thanks shall we give to Simon and his sons?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For he and his brethren and the house of his father have established Israel, and chased away in fight their enemies from them, and confirmed their liberty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So then they wrote it in tables of brass, which they set upon pillars in mount Sion: and this is the copy of the writing; The eighteenth day of the month Elul, in the hundred threescore and twelfth year, being the third year of Simon the high priest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">At Saramel in the great congregation of the priests, and people, and rulers of the nation, and elders of the country, were these things notified unto us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Forasmuch as oftentimes there have been wars in the country, wherein for the maintenance of their sanctuary, and the law, Simon the son of Mattathias, of the posterity of Jarib, together with his brethren, put themselves in jeopardy, and resisting the enemies of their nation did their nation great honour:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">(For after that Jonathan, having gathered his nation together, and been their high priest, was added to his people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Their enemies prepared to invade their country, that they might destroy it, and lay hands on the sanctuary:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">At which time Simon rose up, and fought for his nation, and spent much of his own substance, and armed the valiant men of his nation and gave them wages,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And fortified the cities of Judea, together with Bethsura, that lieth upon the borders of Judea, where the armour of the enemies had been before; but he set a garrison of Jews there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Moreover he fortified Joppa, which lieth upon the sea, and Gazera, that bordereth upon Azotus, where the enemies had dwelt before: but he placed Jews there, and furnished them with all things convenient for the reparation thereof.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The people therefore sang the acts of Simon, and unto what glory he thought to bring his nation, made him their governor and chief priest, because he had done all these things, and for the justice and faith which he kept to his nation, and for that he sought by all means to exalt his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For in his time things prospered in his hands, so that the heathen were taken out of their country, and they also that were in the city of David in Jerusalem, who had made themselves a tower, out of which they issued, and polluted all about the sanctuary, and did much hurt in the holy place:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he placed Jews therein. and fortified it for the safety of the country and the city, and raised up the walls of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">King Demetrius also confirmed him in the high priesthood according to those things,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And made him one of his friends, and honoured him with great honour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For he had heard say, that the Romans had called the Jews their friends and confederates and brethren; and that they had entertained the ambassadors of Simon honourably;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Also that the Jews and priests were well pleased that Simon should be their governor and high priest for ever, until there should arise a faithful prophet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Moreover that he should be their captain, and should take charge of the sanctuary, to set them over their works, and over the country, and over the armour, and over the fortresses, that, I say, he should take charge of the sanctuary;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Beside this, that he should be obeyed of every man, and that all the writings in the country should be made in his name, and that he should be clothed in purple, and wear gold:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Also that it should be lawful for none of the people or priests to break any of these things, or to gainsay his words, or to gather an assembly in the country without him, or to be clothed in purple, or wear a buckle of gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And whosoever should do otherwise, or break any of these things, he should be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Thus it liked all the people to deal with Simon, and to do as hath been said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Then Simon accepted hereof, and was well pleased to be high priest, and captain and governor of the Jews and priests, and to defend them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">So they commanded that this writing should be put in tables of brass, and that they should be set up within the compass of the sanctuary in a conspicuous place;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Also that the copies thereof should be laid up in the treasury, to the end that Simon and his sons might have them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover Antiochus son of Demetrius the king sent letters from the isles of the sea unto Simon the priest and prince of the Jews, and to all the people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The contents whereof were these: King Antiochus to Simon the high priest and prince of his nation, and to the people of the Jews, greeting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdom of our fathers, and my purpose is to challenge it again, that I may restore it to the old estate, and to that end have gathered a multitude of foreign soldiers together, and prepared ships of war;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">My meaning also being to go through the country, that I may be avenged of them that have destroyed it, and made many cities in the kingdom desolate:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now therefore I confirm unto thee all the oblations which the kings before me granted thee, and whatsoever gifts besides they granted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I give thee leave also to coin money for thy country with thine own stamp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And as concerning Jerusalem and the sanctuary, let them be free; and all the armour that thou hast made, and fortresses that thou hast built, and keepest in thine hands, let them remain unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And if anything be, or shall be, owing to the king, let it be forgiven thee from this time forth for evermore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Furthermore, when we have obtained our kingdom, we will honour thee, and thy nation, and thy temple, with great honour, so that your honour shall be known throughout the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In the hundred threescore and fourteenth year went Antiochus into the land of his fathers: at which time all the forces came together unto him, so that few were left with Tryphon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Wherefore being pursued by king Antiochus, he fled unto Dora, which lieth by the sea side:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For he saw that troubles came upon him all at once, and that his forces had forsaken him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then camped Antiochus against Dora, having with him an hundred and twenty thousand men of war, and eight thousand horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he had compassed the city round about, and joined ships close to the town on the sea side, he vexed the city by land and by sea, neither suffered he any to go out or in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In the mean season came Numenius and his company from Rome, having letters to the kings and countries; wherein were written these things:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Lucius, consul of the Romans unto king Ptolemee, greeting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The Jews' ambassadors, our friends and confederates, came unto us to renew the old friendship and league, being sent from Simon the high priest, and from the people of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they brought a shield of gold of a thousand pound.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">We thought it good therefore to write unto the kings and countries, that they should do them no harm, nor fight against them, their cities, or countries, nor yet aid their enemies against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">It seemed also good to us to receive the shield of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">If therefore there be any pestilent fellows, that have fled from their country unto you, deliver them unto Simon the high priest, that he may punish them according to their own law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The same things wrote he likewise unto Demetrius the king, and Attalus, to Ariarathes, and Arsaces,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And to all the countries and to Sampsames, and the Lacedemonians, and to Delus, and Myndus, and Sicyon, and Caria, and Samos, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and Halicarnassus, and Rhodus, and Aradus, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus, and Gortyna, and Cnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the copy hereof they wrote to Simon the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So Antiochus the king camped against Dora the second day, assaulting it continually, and making engines, by which means he shut up Tryphon, that he could neither go out nor in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">At that time Simon sent him two thousand chosen men to aid him; silver also, and gold, and much armour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Nevertheless he would not receive them, but brake all the covenants which he had made with him afore, and became strange unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Furthermore he sent unto him Athenobius, one of his friends, to commune with him, and say, Ye withhold Joppa and Gazera; with the tower that is in Jerusalem, which are cities of my realm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The borders thereof ye have wasted, and done great hurt in the land, and got the dominion of many places within my kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now therefore deliver the cities which ye have taken, and the tributes of the places, whereof ye have gotten dominion without the borders of Judea:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Or else give me for them five hundred talents of silver; and for the harm that ye have done, and the tributes of the cities, other five hundred talents: if not, we will come and fight against you</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So Athenobius the king's friend came to Jerusalem: and when he saw the glory of Simon, and the cupboard of gold and silver plate, and his great attendance, he was astonished, and told him the king's message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then answered Simon, and said unto him, We have neither taken other men's land, nor holden that which appertaineth to others, but the inheritance of our fathers, which our enemies had wrongfully in possession a certain time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Wherefore we, having opportunity, hold the inheritance of our fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And whereas thou demandest Joppa and Gazera, albeit they did great harm unto the people in our country, yet will we give thee an hundred talents for them. Hereunto Athenobius answered him not a word;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But returned in a rage to the king, and made report unto him of these speeches, and of the glory of Simon, and of all that he had seen: whereupon the king was exceeding wroth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">In the mean time fled Tryphon by ship unto Orthosias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then the king made Cendebeus captain of the sea coast, and gave him an host of footmen and horsemen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And commanded him to remove his host toward Judea; also he commanded him to build up Cedron, and to fortify the gates, and to war against the people; but as for the king himself, he pursued Tryphon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So Cendebeus came to Jamnia and began to provoke the people and to invade Judea, and to take the people prisoners, and slay them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when he had built up Cedrou, he set horsemen there, and an host of footmen, to the end that issuing out they might make outroads upon the ways of Judea, as the king had commanded him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came up John from Gazera, and told Simon his father what Cendebeus had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Wherefore Simon called his two eldest sons, Judas and John, and said unto them, I, and my brethren, and my father's house, have ever from my youth unto this day fought against the enemies of Israel; and things have prospered so well in our hands, that we have delivered Israel oftentimes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But now I am old, and ye, by God's mercy, are of a sufficient age: be ye instead of me and my brother, and go and fight for our nation, and the help from heaven be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So he chose out of the country twenty thousand men of war with horsemen, who went out against Cendebeus, and rested that night at Modin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when as they rose in the morning, and went into the plain, behold, a mighty great host both of footmen and horsemen came against them: howbeit there was a water brook betwixt them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So he and his people pitched over against them: and when he saw that the people were afraid to go over the water brook, he went first over himself, and then the men seeing him passed through after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That done, he divided his men, and set the horsemen in the midst of the footmen: for the enemies' horsemen were very many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then sounded they with the holy trumpets: whereupon Cendebeus and his host were put to flight, so that many of them were slain, and the remnant gat them to the strong hold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">At that time was Judas John's brother wounded; but John still followed after them, until he came to Cedron, which Cendebeus had built.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they fled even unto the towers in the fields of Azotus; wherefore he burned it with fire: so that there were slain of them about two thousand men. Afterward he returned into the land of Judea in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moreover in the plain of Jericho was Ptolemeus the son of Abubus made captain, and he had abundance of silver and gold:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For he was the high priest's son in law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Wherefore his heart being lifted up, he thought to get the country to himself, and thereupon consulted deceitfully against Simon and his sons to destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now Simon was visiting the cities that were in the country, and taking care for the good ordering of them; at which time he came down himself to Jericho with his sons, Mattathias and Judas, in the hundred threescore and seventeenth year, in the eleventh month, called Sabat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Where the son of Abubus receiving them deceitfully into a little hold, called Docus, which he had built, made them a great banquet: howbeit he had hid men there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So when Simon and his sons had drunk largely, Ptolemee and his men rose up, and took their weapons, and came upon Simon into the banqueting place, and slew him, and his two sons, and certain of his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In which doing he committed a great treachery, and recompensed evil for good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Ptolemee wrote these things, and sent to the king, that he should send him an host to aid him, and he would deliver him the country and cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He sent others also to Gazera to kill John: and unto the tribunes he sent letters to come unto him, that he might give them silver, and gold, and rewards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And others he sent to take Jerusalem, and the mountain of the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now one had run afore to Gazera and told John that his father and brethren were slain, and, quoth he, Ptolemee hath sent to slay thee also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Hereof when he heard, he was sore astonished: so he laid hands on them that were come to destroy him, and slew them; for he knew that they sought to make him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As concerning the rest of the acts of John, and his wars, and worthy deeds which he did, and the building of the walls which he made, and his doings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Behold, these are written in the chronicles of his priesthood, from the time he was made high priest after his father.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And hear your prayers, and be at one with you, and never forsake you in time of trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now we be here praying for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What time as Demetrius reigned, in the hundred threescore and ninth year, we the Jews wrote unto you in the extremity of trouble that came upon us in those years, from the time that Jason and his company revolted from the holy land and kingdom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And burned the porch, and shed innocent blood: then we prayed unto the Lord, and were heard; we offered also sacrifices and fine flour, and lighted the lamps, and set forth the loaves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And now see that ye keep the feast of tabernacles in the month Casleu.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In the hundred fourscore and eighth year, the people that were at Jerusalem and in Judea, and the council, and Judas, sent greeting and health unto Aristobulus, king Ptolemeus' master, who was of the stock of the anointed priests, and to the Jews that were in Egypt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Insomuch as God hath delivered us from great perils, we thank him highly, as having been in battle against a king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For he cast them out that fought within the holy city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For when the leader was come into Persia, and the army with him that seemed invincible, they were slain in the temple of Nanea by the deceit of Nanea's priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For Antiochus, as though he would marry her, came into the place, and his friends that were with him, to receive money in name of a dowry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Which when the priests of Nanea had set forth, and he was entered with a small company into the compass of the temple, they shut the temple as soon as Antiochus was come in:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And opening a privy door of the roof, they threw stones like thunderbolts, and struck down the captain, hewed them in pieces, smote off their heads and cast them to those that were without.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Blessed be our God in all things, who hath delivered up the ungodly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore whereas we are now purposed to keep the purification of the temple upon the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu, we thought it necessary to certify you thereof, that ye also might keep it, as the feast of the tabernacles, and of the fire, which was given us when Neemias offered sacrifice, after that he had builded the temple and the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests that were then devout took the fire of the altar privily, and hid it in an hollow place of a pit without water, where they kept it sure, so that the place was unknown to all men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now after many years, when it pleased God, Neemias, being sent from the king of Persia, did send of the posterity of those priests that had hid it to the fire: but when they told us they found no fire, but thick water;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then commanded he them to draw it up, and to bring it; and when the sacrifices were laid on, Neemias commanded the priests to sprinkle the wood and the things laid thereupon with the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When this was done, and the time came that the sun shone, which afore was hid in the cloud, there was a great fire kindled, so that every man marvelled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the priests made a prayer whilst the sacrifice was consuming, I say, both the priests, and all the rest, Jonathan beginning, and the rest answering thereunto, as Neemias did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the prayer was after this manner; O Lord, Lord God, Creator of all things, who art fearful and strong, and righteous, and merciful, and the only and gracious King,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The only giver of all things, the only just, almighty, and everlasting, thou that deliverest Israel from all trouble, and didst choose the fathers, and sanctify them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Receive the sacrifice for thy whole people Israel, and preserve thine own portion, and sanctify it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Gather those together that are scattered from us, deliver them that serve among the heathen, look upon them that are despised and abhorred, and let the heathen know that thou art our God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Plant thy people again in thy holy place, as Moses hath spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the priests sung psalms of thanksgiving.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now when the sacrifice was consumed, Neemias commanded the water that was left to be poured on the great stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">When this was done, there was kindled a flame: but it was consumed by the light that shined from the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So when this matter was known, it was told the king of Persia, that in the place, where the priests that were led away had hid the fire, there appeared water, and that Neemias had purified the sacrifices therewith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then the king, inclosing the place, made it holy, after he had tried the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the king took many gifts, and bestowed thereof on those whom he would gratify.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">It is also found in the records, that Jeremy the prophet commanded them that were carried away to take of the fire, as it hath been signified:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And how that the prophet, having given them the law, charged them not to forget the commandments of the Lord, and that they should not err in their minds, when they see images of silver and gold, with their ornaments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And with other such speeches exhorted he them, that the law should not depart from their hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It was also contained in the same writing, that the prophet, being warned of God, commanded the tabernacle and the ark to go with him, as he went forth into the mountain, where Moses climbed up, and saw the heritage of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Jeremy came thither, he found an hollow cave, wherein he laid the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar of incense, and so stopped the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And some of those that followed him came to mark the way, but they could not find it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Which when Jeremy perceived, he blamed them, saying, As for that place, it shall be unknown until the time that God gather his people again together, and receive them unto mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then shall the Lord shew them these things, and the glory of the Lord shall appear, and the cloud also, as it was shewed under Moses, and as when Solomon desired that the place might be honourably sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It was also declared, that he being wise offered the sacrifice of dedication, and of the finishing of the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And as when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the sacrifices: even so prayed Solomon also, and the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Moses said, Because the sin offering was not to be eaten, it was consumed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Solomon kept those eight days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The same things also were reported in the writings and commentaries of Neemias; and how he founding a library gathered together the acts of the kings, and the prophets, and of David, and the epistles of the kings concerning the holy gifts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In like manner also Judas gathered together all those things that were lost by reason of the war we had, and they remain with us,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Whereas we then are about to celebrate the purification, we have written unto you, and ye shall do well, if ye keep the same days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">We hope also, that the God, that delivered all his people, and gave them all an heritage, and the kingdom, and the priesthood, and the sanctuary,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As he promised in the law, will shortly have mercy upon us, and gather us together out of every land under heaven into the holy place: for he hath delivered us out of great troubles, and hath purified the place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now as concerning Judas Maccabeus, and his brethren, and the purification of the great temple, and the dedication of the altar,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and the laws were kept very well, because of the godliness of Onias the high priest, and his hatred of wickedness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It came to pass that even the kings themselves did honour the place, and magnify the temple with their best gifts;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Insomuch that Seleucus of Asia of his own revenues bare all the costs belonging to the service of the sacrifices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But one Simon of the tribe of Benjamin, who was made governor of the temple, fell out with the high priest about disorder in the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when he could not overcome Onias, he gat him to Apollonius the son of Thraseas, who then was governor of Celosyria and Phenice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And told him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of infinite sums of money, so that the multitude of their riches, which did not pertain to the account of the sacrifices, was innumerable, and that it was possible to bring all into the king's hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now when Apollonius came to the king, and had shewed him of the money whereof he was told, the king chose out Heliodorus his treasurer, and sent him with a commandment to bring him the foresaid money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So forthwith Heliodorus took his journey; under a colour of visiting the cities of Celosyria and Phenice, but indeed to fulfil the king's purpose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteously received of the high priest of the city, he told him what intelligence was given of the money, and declared wherefore he came, and asked if these things were so indeed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the high priest told him that there was such money laid up for the relief of widows and fatherless children:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And that some of it belonged to Hircanus son of Tobias, a man of great dignity, and not as that wicked Simon had misinformed: the sum whereof in all was four hundred talents of silver, and two hundred of gold:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And that it was altogether impossible that such wrongs should be done unto them, that had committed it to the holiness of the place, and to the majesty and inviolable sanctity of the temple, honoured over all the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Heliodorus, because of the king's commandment given him, said, That in any wise it must be brought into the king's treasury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So at the day which he appointed he entered in to order this matter: wherefore there was no small agony throughout the whole city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the priests, prostrating themselves before the altar in their priests' vestments, called unto heaven upon him that made a law concerning things given to he kept, that they should safely be preserved for such as had committed them to be kept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then whoso had looked the high priest in the face, it would have wounded his heart: for his countenance and the changing of his colour declared the inward agony of his mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the man was so compassed with fear and horror of the body, that it was manifest to them that looked upon him, what sorrow he had now in his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Others ran flocking out of their houses to the general supplication, because the place was like to come into contempt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the women, girt with sackcloth under their breasts, abounded in the streets, and the virgins that were kept in ran, some to the gates, and some to the walls, and others looked out of the windows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And all, holding their hands toward heaven, made supplication.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then it would have pitied a man to see the falling down of the multitude of all sorts, and the fear of the high priest being in such an agony.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They then called upon the Almighty Lord to keep the things committed of trust safe and sure for those that had committed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Nevertheless Heliodorus executed that which was decreed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now as he was there present himself with his guard about the treasury, the Lord of spirits, and the Prince of all power, caused a great apparition, so that all that presumed to come in with him were astonished at the power of God, and fainted, and were sore afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For there appeared unto them an horse with a terrible rider upon him, and adorned with a very fair covering, and he ran fiercely, and smote at Heliodorus with his forefeet, and it seemed that he that sat upon the horse had complete harness of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Moreover two other young men appeared before him, notable in strength, excellent in beauty, and comely in apparel, who stood by him on either side; and scourged him continually, and gave him many sore stripes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Heliodorus fell suddenly unto the ground, and was compassed with great darkness: but they that were with him took him up, and put him into a litter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Thus him, that lately came with a great train and with all his guard into the said treasury, they carried out, being unable to help himself with his weapons: and manifestly they acknowledged the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For he by the hand of God was cast down, and lay speechless without all hope of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But they praised the Lord, that had miraculously honoured his own place: for the temple; which a little afore was full of fear and trouble, when the Almighty Lord appeared, was filled with joy and gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then straightways certain of Heliodorus' friends prayed Onias, that he would call upon the most High to grant him his life, who lay ready to give up the ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So the high priest, suspecting lest the king should misconceive that some treachery had been done to Heliodorus by the Jews, offered a sacrifice for the health of the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now as the high priest was making an atonement, the same young men in the same clothing appeared and stood beside Heliodorus, saying, Give Onias the high priest great thanks, insomuch as for his sake the Lord hath granted thee life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And seeing that thou hast been scourged from heaven, declare unto all men the mighty power of God. And when they had spoken these words, they appeared no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So Heliodorus, after he had offered sacrifice unto the Lord, and made great vows unto him that had saved his life, and saluted Onias, returned with his host to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then testified he to all men the works of the great God, which he had seen with his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And when the king Heliodorus, who might be a fit man to be sent yet once again to Jerusalem, he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">If thou hast any enemy or traitor, send him thither, and thou shalt receive him well scourged, if he escape with his life: for in that place, no doubt; there is an especial power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For he that dwelleth in heaven hath his eye on that place, and defendeth it; and he beateth and destroyeth them that come to hurt it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And the things concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of the treasury, fell out on this sort.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">This Simon now, of whom we spake afore, having been a betrayer of the money, and of his country, slandered Onias, as if he ha terrified Heliodorus, and been the worker of these evils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus was he bold to call him a traitor, that had deserved well of the city, and tendered his own nation, and was so zealous of the laws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But when their hatred went so far, that by one of Simon's faction murders were committed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Onias seeing the danger of this contention, and that Apollonius, as being the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, did rage, and increase Simon's malice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He went to the king, not to be an accuser of his countrymen, but seeking the good of all, both publick and private:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For he saw that it was impossible that the state should continue quiet, and Simon leave his folly, unless the king did look thereunto.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, called Epiphanes, took the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias laboured underhand to be high priest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Promising unto the king by intercession three hundred and threescore talents of silver, and of another revenue eighty talents:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Beside this, he promised to assign an hundred and fifty more, if he might have licence to set him up a place for exercise, and for the training up of youth in the fashions of the heathen, and to write them of Jerusalem by the name of Antiochians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Which when the king had granted, and he had gotten into his hand the rule he forthwith brought his own nation to Greekish fashion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the royal privileges granted of special favour to the Jews by the means of John the father of Eupolemus, who went ambassador to Rome for amity and aid, he took away; and putting down the governments which were according to the law, he brought up new customs against the law:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For he built gladly a place of exercise under the tower itself, and brought the chief young men under his subjection, and made them wear a hat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now such was the height of Greek fashions, and increase of heathenish manners, through the exceeding profaneness of Jason, that ungodly wretch, and no high priest;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That the priests had no courage to serve any more at the altar, but despising the temple, and neglecting the sacrifices, hastened to be partakers of the unlawful allowance in the place of exercise, after the game of Discus called them forth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Not setting by the honours of their fathers, but liking the glory of the Grecians best of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">By reason whereof sore calamity came upon them: for they had them to be their enemies and avengers, whose custom they followed so earnestly, and unto whom they desired to be like in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For it is not a light thing to do wickedly against the laws of God: but the time following shall declare these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now when the game that was used every faith year was kept at Tyrus, the king being present,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This ungracious Jason sent special messengers from Jerusalem, who were Antiochians, to carry three hundred drachms of silver to the sacrifice of Hercules, which even the bearers thereof thought fit not to bestow upon the sacrifice, because it was not convenient, but to be reserved for other charges.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">This money then, in regard of the sender, was appointed to Hercules' sacrifice; but because of the bearers thereof, it was employed to the making of gallies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now when Apollonius the son of Menestheus was sent into Egypt for the coronation of king Ptolemeus Philometor, Antiochus, understanding him not to be well affected to his affairs, provided for his own safety: whereupon he came to Joppa, and from thence to Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Where he was honourably received of Jason, and of the city, and was brought in with torch alight, and with great shoutings: and so afterward went with his host unto Phenice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Three years afterward Jason sent Menelans, the aforesaid Simon's brother, to bear the money unto the king, and to put him in mind of certain necessary matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But he being brought to the presence of the king, when he had magnified him for the glorious appearance of his power, got the priesthood to himself, offering more than Jason by three hundred talents of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So he came with the king's mandate, bringing nothing worthy the high priesthood, but having the fury of a cruel tyrant, and the rage of a savage beast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Jason, who had undermined his own brother, being undermined by another, was compelled to flee into the country of the Ammonites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So Menelans got the principality: but as for the money that he had promised unto the king, he took no good order for it, albeit Sostratis the ruler of the castle required it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For unto him appertained the gathering of the customs. Wherefore they were both called before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now Menelans left his brother Lysimachus in his stead in the priesthood; and Sostratus left Crates, who was governor of the Cyprians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">While those things were in doing, they of Tarsus and Mallos made insurrection, because they were given to the king's concubine, called Antiochus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then came the king in all haste to appease matters, leaving Andronicus, a man in authority, for his deputy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now Menelans, supposing that he had gotten a convenient time, stole certain vessels of gold out of the temple, and gave some of them to Andronicus, and some he sold into Tyrus and the cities round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Which when Onias knew of a surety, he reproved him, and withdrew himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lieth by Antiochia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Wherefore Menelans, taking Andronicus apart, prayed, him to get Onias into his hands; who being persuaded thereunto, and coming to Onias in deceit, gave him his right hand with oaths; and though he were suspected by him, yet persuaded he him to come forth of the sanctuary: whom forthwith he shut up without regard of justice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For the which cause not only the Jews, but many also of other nations, took great indignation, and were much grieved for the unjust murder of the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And when the king was come again from the places about Cilicia, the Jews that were in the city, and certain of the Greeks that abhorred the fact also, complained because Onias was slain without cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Therefore Antiochus was heartily sorry, and moved to pity, and wept, because of the sober and modest behaviour of him that was dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And being kindled with anger, forthwith he took away Andronicus his purple, and rent off his clothes, and leading him through the whole city unto that very place, where he had committed impiety against Onias, there slew he the cursed murderer. Thus the Lord rewarded him his punishment, as he had deserved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now when many sacrileges had been committed in the city by Lysimachus with the consent of Menelans, and the fruit thereof was spread abroad, the multitude gathered themselves together against Lysimachus, many vessels of gold being already carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Whereupon the common people rising, and being filled with rage, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and began first to offer violence; one Auranus being the leader, a man far gone in years, and no less in folly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They then seeing the attempt of Lysimachus, some of them caught stones, some clubs, others taking handfuls of dust, that was next at hand, cast them all together upon Lysimachus, and those that set upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Thus many of them they wounded, and some they struck to the ground, and all of them they forced to flee: but as for the churchrobber himself, him they killed beside the treasury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Of these matters therefore there was an accusation laid against Menelans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now when the king came to Tyrus, three men that were sent from the senate pleaded the cause before him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But Menelans, being now convicted, promised Ptolemee the son of Dorymenes to give him much money, if he would pacify the king toward him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Whereupon Ptolemee taking the king aside into a certain gallery, as it were to take the air, brought him to be of another mind:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Insomuch that he discharged Menelans from the accusations, who notwithstanding was cause of all the mischief: and those poor men, who, if they had told their cause, yea, before the Scythians, should have been judged innocent, them he condemned to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Thus they that followed the matter for the city, and for the people, and for the holy vessels, did soon suffer unjust punishment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Wherefore even they of Tyrus, moved with hatred of that wicked deed, caused them to be honourably buried.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And so through the covetousness of them that were of power Menelans remained still in authority, increasing in malice, and being a great traitor to the citizens.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">About the same time Antiochus prepared his second voyage into Egypt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And then it happened, that through all the city, for the space almost of forty days, there were seen horsemen running in the air, in cloth of gold, and armed with lances, like a band of soldiers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And troops of horsemen in array, encountering and running one against another, with shaking of shields, and multitude of pikes, and drawing of swords, and casting of darts, and glittering of golden ornaments, and harness of all sorts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Wherefore every man prayed that that apparition might turn to good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now when there was gone forth a false rumour, as though Antiochus had been dead, Jason took at the least a thousand men, and suddenly made an assault upon the city; and they that were upon the walls being put back, and the city at length taken, Menelans fled into the castle:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Jason slew his own citizens without mercy, not considering that to get the day of them of his own nation would be a most unhappy day for him; but thinking they had been his enemies, and not his countrymen, whom he conquered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Howbeit for all this he obtained not the principality, but at the last received shame for the reward of his treason, and fled again into the country of the Ammonites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In the end therefore he had an unhappy return, being accused before Aretas the king of the Arabians, fleeing from city to city, pursued of all men, hated as a forsaker of the laws, and being had in abomination as an open enemy of his country and countrymen, he was cast out into Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Thus he that had driven many out of their country perished in a strange land, retiring to the Lacedemonians, and thinking there to find succour by reason of his kindred:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he that had cast out many unburied had none to mourn for him, nor any solemn funerals at all, nor sepulchre with his fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when this that was done came to the king's car, he thought that Judea had revolted: whereupon removing out of Egypt in a furious mind, he took the city by force of arms,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And commanded his men of war not to spare such as they met, and to slay such as went up upon the houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Thus there was killing of young and old, making away of men, women, and children, slaying of virgins and infants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there were destroyed within the space of three whole days fourscore thousand, whereof forty thousand were slain in the conflict; and no fewer sold than slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yet was he not content with this, but presumed to go intothe most holy temple of all the world; Menelans, that traitor to the laws, and to his own country, being his guide:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And taking the holy vessels with polluted hands, and with profane hands pulling down the things that were dedicated by other kings to the augmentation and glory and honour of the place, he gave them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And so haughty was Antiochus in mind, that he considered not that the Lord was angry for a while for the sins of them that dwelt in the city, and therefore his eye was not upon the place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For had they not been formerly wrapped in many sins, this man, as soon as he had come, had forthwith been scourged, and put back from his presumption, as Heliodorus was, whom Seleucus the king sent to view the treasury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Nevertheless God did not choose the people for the place's sake, but the place far the people's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And therefore the place itself, that was partaker with them of the adversity that happened to the nation, did afterward communicate in the benefits sent from the Lord: and as it was forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty, so again, the great Lord being reconciled, it was set up with all glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So when Antiochus had carried out of the temple a thousand and eight hundred talents, he departed in all haste unto Antiochia, weening in his pride to make the land navigable, and the sea passable by foot: such was the haughtiness of his mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he left governors to vex the nation: at Jerusalem, Philip, for his country a Phrygian, and for manners more barbarous than he that set him there;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And at Garizim, Andronicus; and besides, Menelans, who worse than all the rest bare an heavy hand over the citizens, having a malicious mind against his countrymen the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He sent also that detestable ringleader Apollonius with an army of two and twenty thousand, commanding him to slay all those that were in their best age, and to sell the women and the younger sort:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Who coming to Jerusalem, and pretending peace, did forbear till the holy day of the sabbath, when taking the Jews keeping holy day, he commanded his men to arm themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And so he slew all them that were gone to the celebrating of the sabbath, and running through the city with weapons slew great multitudes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Judas Maccabeus with nine others, or thereabout, withdrew himself into the wilderness, and lived in the mountains after the manner of beasts, with his company, who fed on herbs continually, lest they should be partakers of the pollution.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Not long after this the king sent an old man of Athens to compel the Jews to depart from the laws of their fathers, and not to live after the laws of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And to pollute also the temple in Jerusalem, and to call it the temple of Jupiter Olympius; and that in Garizim, of Jupiter the Defender of strangers, as they did desire that dwelt in the place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The coming in of this mischief was sore and grievous to the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For the temple was filled with riot and revelling by the Gentiles, who dallied with harlots, and had to do with women within the circuit of the holy places, and besides that brought in things that were not lawful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The altar also was filled with profane things, which the law forbiddeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Neither was it lawful for a man to keep sabbath days or ancient fasts, or to profess himself at all to be a Jew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And in the day of the king's birth every month they were brought by bitter constraint to eat of the sacrifices; and when the fast of Bacchus was kept, the Jews were compelled to go in procession to Bacchus, carrying ivy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Moreover there went out a decree to the neighbour cities of the heathen, by the suggestion of Ptolemee, against the Jews, that they should observe the same fashions, and be partakers of their sacrifices:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And whoso would not conform themselves to the manners of the Gentiles should be put to death. Then might a man have seen the present misery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For there were two women brought, who had circumcised their children; whom when they had openly led round about the city, the babes handing at their breasts, they cast them down headlong from the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And others, that had run together into caves near by, to keep the sabbath day secretly, being discovered by Philip, were all burnt together, because they made a conscience to help themselves for the honour of the most sacred day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now I beseech those that read this book, that they be not discouraged for these calamities, but that they judge those punishments not to be for destruction, but for a chastening of our nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For it is a token of his great goodness, when wicked doers are not suffered any long time, but forthwith punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For not as with other nations, whom the Lord patiently forbeareth to punish, till they be come to the fulness of their sins, so dealeth he with us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Lest that, being come to the height of sin, afterwards he should take vengeance of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And therefore he never withdraweth his mercy from us: and though he punish with adversity, yet doth he never forsake his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But let this that we at spoken be for a warning unto us. And now will we come to the declaring of the matter in a few words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, an aged man, and of a well favoured countenance, was constrained to open his mouth, and to eat swine's flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But he, choosing rather to die gloriously, than to live stained with such an abomination, spit it forth, and came of his own accord to the torment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As it behoved them to come, that are resolute to stand out against such things, as are not lawful for love of life to be tasted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But they that had the charge of that wicked feast, for the old acquaintance they had with the man, taking him aside, besought him to bring flesh of his own provision, such as was lawful for him to use, and make as if he did eat of the flesh taken from the sacrifice commanded by the king;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">That in so doing he might be delivered from death, and for the old friendship with them find favour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he began to consider discreetly, and as became his age, and the excellency of his ancient years, and the honour of his gray head, whereon was come, and his most honest education from a child, or rather the holy law made and given by God: therefore he answered accordingly, and willed them straightways to send him to the grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For it becometh not our age, said he, in any wise to dissemble, whereby many young persons might think that Eleazar, being fourscore years old and ten, were now gone to a strange religion;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And so they through mine hypocrisy, and desire to live a little time and a moment longer, should be deceived by me, and I get a stain to mine old age, and make it abominable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For though for the present time I should be delivered from the punishment of men: yet should I not escape the hand of the Almighty, neither alive, nor dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Wherefore now, manfully changing this life, I will shew myself such an one as mine age requireth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And leave a notable example to such as be young to die willingly and courageously for the honourable and holy laws. And when he had said these words, immediately he went to the torment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They that led him changing the good will they bare him a little before into hatred, because the foresaid speeches proceeded, as they thought, from a desperate mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But when he was ready to die with stripes, he groaned, and said, It is manifest unto the Lord, that hath the holy knowledge, that whereas I might have been delivered from death, I now endure sore pains in body by being beaten: but in soul am well content to suffer these things, because I fear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And thus this man died, leaving his death for an example of a noble courage, and a memorial of virtue, not only unto young men, but unto all his nation.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It came to pass also, that seven brethren with their mother were taken, and compelled by the king against the law to taste swine's flesh, and were tormented with scourges and whips.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But one of them that spake first said thus, What wouldest thou ask or learn of us? we are ready to die, rather than to transgress the laws of our fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the king, being in a rage, commanded pans and caldrons to be made hot:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Which forthwith being heated, he commanded to cut out the tongue of him that spake first, and to cut off the utmost parts of his body, the rest of his brethren and his mother looking on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now when he was thus maimed in all his members, he commanded him being yet alive to be brought to the fire, and to be fried in the pan: and as the vapour of the pan was for a good space dispersed, they exhorted one another with the mother to die manfully, saying thus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The Lord God looketh upon us, and in truth hath comfort in us, as Moses in his song, which witnessed to their faces, declared, saying, And he shall be comforted in his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So when the first was dead after this number, they brought the second to make him a mocking stock: and when they had pulled off the skin of his head with the hair, they asked him, Wilt thou eat, before thou be punished throughout every member of thy body?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But he answered in his own language, and said, No. Wherefore he also received the next torment in order, as the former did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when he was at the last gasp, he said, Thou like a fury takest us out of this present life, but the King of the world shall raise us up, who have died for his laws, unto everlasting life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">After him was the third made a mocking stock: and when he was required, he put out his tongue, and that right soon, holding forth his hands manfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And said courageously, These I had from heaven; and for his laws I despise them; and from him I hope to receive them again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Insomuch that the king, and they that were with him, marvelled at the young man's courage, for that he nothing regarded the pains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when this man was dead also, they tormented and mangled the fourth in like manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So when he was ready to die he said thus, It is good, being put to death by men, to look for hope from God to be raised up again by him: as for thee, thou shalt have no resurrection to life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Afterward they brought the fifth also, and mangled him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then looked he unto the king, and said, Thou hast power over men, thou art corruptible, thou doest what thou wilt; yet think not that our nation is forsaken of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But abide a while, and behold his great power, how he will torment thee and thy seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">After him also they brought the sixth, who being ready to die said, Be not deceived without cause: for we suffer these things for ourselves, having sinned against our God: therefore marvellous things are done unto us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But think not thou, that takest in hand to strive against God, that thou shalt escape unpunished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the mother was marvellous above all, and worthy of honourable memory: for when she saw her seven sons slain within the space of one day, she bare it with a good courage, because of the hope that she had in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yea, she exhorted every one of them in her own language, filled with courageous spirits; and stirring up her womanish thoughts with a manly stomach, she said unto them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">I cannot tell how ye came into my womb: for I neither gave you breath nor life, neither was it I that formed the members of every one of you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But doubtless the Creator of the world, who formed the generation of man, and found out the beginning of all things, will also of his own mercy give you breath and life again, as ye now regard not your own selves for his laws' sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now Antiochus, thinking himself despised, and suspecting it to be a reproachful speech, whilst the youngest was yet alive, did not only exhort him by words, but also assured him with oaths, that he would make him both a rich and a happy man, if he would turn from the laws of his fathers; and that also he would take him for his friend, and trust him with affairs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But when the young man would in no case hearken unto him, the king called his mother, and exhorted her that she would counsel the young man to save his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when he had exhorted her with many words, she promised him that she would counsel her son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O my son, have pity upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee such three years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age, and endured the troubles of education.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not; and so was mankind made likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Fear not this tormentor, but, being worthy of thy brethren, take thy death that I may receive thee again in mercy with thy brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Whiles she was yet speaking these words, the young man said, Whom wait ye for? I will not obey the king's commandment: but I will obey the commandment of the law that was given unto our fathers by Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And thou, that hast been the author of all mischief against the Hebrews, shalt not escape the hands of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For we suffer because of our sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And though the living Lord be angry with us a little while for our chastening and correction, yet shall he be at one again with his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But thou, O godless man, and of all other most wicked, be not lifted up without a cause, nor puffed up with uncertain hopes, lifting up thy hand against the servants of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of Almighty God, who seeth all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For our brethren, who now have suffered a short pain, are dead under God's covenant of everlasting life: but thou, through the judgment of God, shalt receive just punishment for thy pride.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But I, as my brethren, offer up my body and life for the laws of our fathers, beseeching God that he would speedily be merciful unto our nation; and that thou by torments and plagues mayest confess, that he alone is God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And that in me and my brethren the wrath of the Almighty, which is justly brought upon our nation, may cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Than the king' being in a rage, handed him worse than all the rest, and took it grievously that he was mocked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So this man died undefiled, and put his whole trust in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Last of all after the sons the mother died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Let this be enough now to have spoken concerning the idolatrous feasts, and the extreme tortures.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Judas Maccabeus, and they that were with him, went privily into the towns, and called their kinsfolks together, and took unto them all such as continued in the Jews' religion, and assembled about six thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they called upon the Lord, that he would look upon the people that was trodden down of all; and also pity the temple profaned of ungodly men;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And that he would have compassion upon the city, sore defaced, and ready to be made even with the ground; and hear the blood that cried unto him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And remember the wicked slaughter of harmless infants, and the blasphemies committed against his name; and that he would shew his hatred against the wicked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now when Maccabeis had his company about him, he could not be withstood by the heathen: for the wrath of the Lord was turned into mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore he came at unawares, and burnt up towns and cities, and got into his hands the most commodious places, and overcame and put to flight no small number of his enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But specially took he advantage of the night for such privy attempts, insomuch that the fruit of his holiness was spread every where.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So when Philip saw that this man increased by little and little, and that things prospered with him still more and more, he wrote unto Ptolemeus, the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, to yield more aid to the king's affairs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then forthwith choosing Nicanor the son of Patroclus, one of his special friends, he sent him with no fewer than twenty thousand of all nations under him, to root out the whole generation of the Jews; and with him he joined also Gorgias a captain, who in matters of war had great experience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So Nicanor undertook to make so much money of the captive Jews, as should defray the tribute of two thousand talents, which the king was to pay to the Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Wherefore immediately he sent to the cities upon the sea coast, proclaiming a sale of the captive Jews, and promising that they should have fourscore and ten bodies for one talent, not expecting the vengeance that was to follow upon him from the Almighty God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when word was brought unto Judas of Nicanor's coming, and he had imparted unto those that were with him that the army was at hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They that were fearful, and distrusted the justice of God, fled, and conveyed themselves away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Others sold all that they had left, and withal besought the Lord to deliver them, sold by the wicked Nicanor before they met together:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And if not for their own sakes, yet for the covenants he had made with their fathers, and for his holy and glorious name's sake, by which they were called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Maccabeus called his men together unto the number of six thousand, and exhorted them not to be stricken with terror of the enemy, nor to fear the great multitude of the heathen, who came wrongly against them; but to fight manfully,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And to set before their eyes the injury that they had unjustly done to the holy place, and the cruel handling of the city, whereof they made a mockery, and also the taking away of the government of their forefathers:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For they, said he, trust in their weapons and boldness; but our confidence is in the Almighty who at a beck can cast down both them that come against us, and also all the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moreover, he recounted unto them what helps their forefathers had found, and how they were delivered, when under Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and five thousand perished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he told them of the battle that they had in Babylon with the Galatians, how they came but eight thousand in all to the business, with four thousand Macedonians, and that the Macedonians being perplexed, the eight thousand destroyed an hundred and twenty thousand because of the help that they had from heaven, and so received a great booty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Thus when he had made them bold with these words, and ready to die for the law and the country, he divided his army into four parts;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And joined with himself his own brethren, leaders of each band, to wit Simon, and Joseph, and Jonathan, giving each one fifteen hundred men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Also he appointed Eleazar to read the holy book: and when he had given them this watchword, The help of God; himself leading the first band,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And by the help of the Almighty they slew above nine thousand of their enemies, and wounded and maimed the most part of Nicanor's host, and so put all to flight;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And took their money that came to buy them, and pursued them far: but lacking time they returned:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For it was the day before the sabbath, and therefore they would no longer pursue them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So when they had gathered their armour together, and spoiled their enemies, they occupied themselves about the sabbath, yielding exceeding praise and thanks to the Lord, who had preserved them unto that day, which was the beginning of mercy distilling upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And after the sabbath, when they had given part of the spoils to the maimed, and the widows, and orphans, the residue they divided among themselves and their servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When this was done, and they had made a common supplication, they besought the merciful Lord to be reconciled with his servants for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Moreover of those that were with Timotheus and Bacchides, who fought against them, they slew above twenty thousand, and very easily got high and strong holds, and divided among themselves many spoils more, and made the maimed, orphans, widows, yea, and the aged also, equal in spoils with themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had gathered their armour together, they laid them up all carefully in convenient places, and the remnant of the spoils they brought to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They slew also Philarches, that wicked person, who was with Timotheus, and had annoyed the Jews many ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Furthermore at such time as they kept the feast for the victory in their country they burnt Callisthenes, that had set fire upon the holy gates, who had fled into a little house; and so he received a reward meet for his wickedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">As for that most ungracious Nicanor, who had brought a thousand merchants to buy the Jews,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He was through the help of the Lord brought down by them, of whom he made least account; and putting off his glorious apparel, and discharging his company, he came like a fugitive servant through the midland unto Antioch having very great dishonour, for that his host was destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Thus he, that took upon him to make good to the Romans their tribute by means of captives in Jerusalem, told abroad, that the Jews had God to fight for them, and therefore they could not be hurt, because they followed the laws that he gave them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">About that time came Antiochus with dishonour out of the country of Persia</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For he had entered the city called Persepolis, and went about to rob the temple, and to hold the city; whereupon the multitude running to defend themselves with their weapons put them to flight; and so it happened, that Antiochus being put to flight of the inhabitants returned with shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now when he came to Ecbatane, news was brought him what had happened unto Nicanor and Timotheus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then swelling with anger. he thought to avenge upon the Jews the disgrace done unto him by those that made him flee. Therefore commanded he his chariotman to drive without ceasing, and to dispatch the journey, the judgment of GOd now following him. For he had spoken proudly in this sort, That he would come to Jerusalem and make it a common burying place of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the Lord Almighty, the God of Isreal, smote him with an incurable and invisible plague: or as soon as he had spoken these words, a pain of the bowels that was remediless came upon him, and sore torments of the inner parts;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And that most justly: for he had tormented other men's bowels with many and strange torments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Howbeit he nothing at all ceased from his bragging, but still was filled with pride, breathing out fire in his rage against the Jews, and commanding to haste the journey: but it came to pass that he fell down from his chariot, carried violently; so that having a sore fall, all the members of his body were much pained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And thus he that a little afore thought he might command the waves of the sea, (so proud was he beyond the condition of man) and weigh the high mountains in a balance, was now cast on the ground, and carried in an horselitter, shewing forth unto all the manifest power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So that the worms rose up out of the body of this wicked man, and whiles he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell away, and the filthiness of his smell was noisome to all his army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the man, that thought a little afore he could reach to the stars of heaven, no man could endure to carry for his intolerable stink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Here therefore, being plagued, he began to leave off his great pride, and to come to the knowledge of himself by the scourge of God, his pain increasing every moment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he himself could not abide his own smell, he said these words, It is meet to be subject unto God, and that a man that is mortal should not proudly think of himself if he were God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">This wicked person vowed also unto the Lord, who now no more would have mercy upon him, saying thus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That the holy city (to the which he was going in haste to lay it even with the ground, and to make it a common buryingplace,) he would set at liberty:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And as touching the Jews, whom he had judged not worthy so much as to be buried, but to be cast out with their children to be devoured of the fowls and wild beasts, he would make them all equals to the citizens of Athens:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the holy temple, which before he had spoiled, he would garnish with goodly gifts, and restore all the holy vessels with many more, and out of his own revenue defray the charges belonging to the sacrifices:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Yea, and that also he would become a Jew himself, and go through all the world that was inhabited, and declare the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But for all this his pains would not cease: for the just judgment of God was come upon him: therefore despairing of his health, he wrote unto the Jews the letter underwritten, containing the form of a supplication, after this manner:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Antiochus, king and governor, to the good Jews his citizens wisheth much joy, health, and prosperity:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">If ye and your children fare well, and your affairs be to your contentment, I give very great thanks to God, having my hope in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">As for me, I was weak, or else I would have remembered kindly your honour and good will returning out of Persia, and being taken with a grievous disease, I thought it necessary to care for the common safety of all:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Not distrusting mine health, but having great hope to escape this sickness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But considering that even my father, at what time he led an army into the high countries. appointed a successor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">To the end that, if any thing fell out contrary to expectation, or if any tidings were brought that were grievous, they of the land, knowing to whom the state was left, might not be troubled:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Again, considering how that the princes that are borderers and neighbours unto my kingdom wait for opportunities, and expect what shall be the event. I have appointed my son Antiochus king, whom I often committed and commended unto many of you, when I went up into the high provinces; to whom I have written as followeth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore I pray and request you to remember the benefits that I have done unto you generally, and in special, and that every man will be still faithful to me and my son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For I am persuaded that he understanding my mind will favourably and graciously yield to your desires.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Thus the murderer and blasphemer having suffered most grievously, as he entreated other men, so died he a miserable death in a strange country in the mountains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Philip, that was brought up with him, carried away his body, who also fearing the son of Antiochus went into Egypt to Ptolemeus Philometor.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Maccabeus and his company, the Lord guiding them, recovered the temple and the city:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the altars which the heathen had built in the open street, and also the chapels, they pulled down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And having cleansed the temple they made another altar, and striking stones they took fire out of them, and offered a sacrifice after two years, and set forth incense, and lights, and shewbread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When that was done, they fell flat down, and besought the Lord that they might come no more into such troubles; but if they sinned any more against him, that he himself would chasten them with mercy, and that they might not be delivered unto the blasphemous and barbarous nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now upon the same day that the strangers profaned the temple, on the very same day it was cleansed again, even the five and twentieth day of the same month, which is Casleu.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they kept the eight days with gladness, as in the feast of the tabernacles, remembering that not long afore they had held the feast of the tabernacles, when as they wandered in the mountains and dens like beasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore they bare branches, and fair boughs, and palms also, and sang psalms unto him that had given them good success in cleansing his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They ordained also by a common statute and decree, That every year those days should be kept of the whole nation of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And this was the end of Antiochus, called Epiphanes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now will we declare the acts of Antiochus Eupator, who was the son of this wicked man, gathering briefly the calamities of the wars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So when he was come to the crown, he set one Lysias over the affairs of his realm, and appointed him his chief governor of Celosyria and Phenice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For Ptolemeus, that was called Macron, choosing rather to do justice unto the Jews for the wrong that had been done unto them, endeavoured to continue peace with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Whereupon being accused of the king's friends before Eupator, and called traitor at every word because he had left Cyprus, that Philometor had committed unto him, and departed to Antiochus Epiphanes, and seeing that he was in no honourable place, he was so discouraged, that he poisoned himself and died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when Gorgias was governor of the holds, he hired soldiers, and nourished war continually with the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And therewithall the Idumeans, having gotten into their hands the most commodious holds, kept the Jews occupied, and receiving those that were banished from Jerusalem, they went about to nourish war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then they that were with Maccabeus made supplication, and besought God that he would be their helper; and so they ran with violence upon the strong holds of the Idumeans,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And assaulting them strongly, they won the holds, and kept off all that fought upon the wall, and slew all that fell into their hands, and killed no fewer than twenty thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And because certain, who were no less than nine thousand, were fled together into two very strong castles, having all manner of things convenient to sustain the siege,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Maccabeus left Simon and Joseph, and Zaccheus also, and them that were with him, who were enough to besiege them, and departed himself unto those places which more needed his help.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now they that were with Simon, being led with covetousness, were persuaded for money through certain of those that were in the castle, and took seventy thousand drachms, and let some of them escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when it was told Maccabeus what was done, he called the governors of the people together, and accused those men, that they had sold their brethren for money, and set their enemies free to fight against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So he slew those that were found traitors, and immediately took the two castles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having good success with his weapons in all things he took in hand, he slew in the two holds more than twenty thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now Timotheus, whom the Jews had overcome before, when he had gathered a great multitude of foreign forces, and horses out of Asia not a few, came as though he would take Jewry by force of arms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But when he drew near, they that were with Maccabeus turned themselves to pray unto God, and sprinkled earth upon their heads, and girded their loins with sackcloth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And fell down at the foot of the altar, and besought him to be merciful to them, and to be an enemy to their enemies, and an adversary to their adversaries, as the law declareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So after the prayer they took their weapons, and went on further from the city: and when they drew near to their enemies, they kept by themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now the sun being newly risen, they joined both together; the one part having together with their virtue their refuge also unto the Lord for a pledge of their success and victory: the other side making their rage leader of their battle</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But when the battle waxed strong, there appeared unto the enemies from heaven five comely men upon horses, with bridles of gold, and two of them led the Jews,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And took Maccabeus betwixt them, and covered him on every side weapons, and kept him safe, but shot arrows and lightnings against the enemies: so that being confounded with blindness, and full of trouble, they were killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And there were slain of footmen twenty thousand and five hundred, and six hundred horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">As for Timotheus himself, he fled into a very strong hold, called Gawra, where Chereas was governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But they that were with Maccabeus laid siege against the fortress courageously four days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they that were within, trusting to the strength of the place, blasphemed exceedingly, and uttered wicked words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Nevertheless upon the fifth day early twenty young men of Maccabeus' company, inflamed with anger because of the blasphemies, assaulted the wall manly, and with a fierce courage killed all that they met withal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Others likewise ascending after them, whiles they were busied with them that were within, burnt the towers, and kindling fires burnt the blasphemers alive; and others broke open the gates, and, having received in the rest of the army, took the city,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And killed Timotheus, that was hid in a certain pit, and Chereas his brother, with Apollophanes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">When this was done, they praised the Lord with psalms and thanksgiving, who had done so great things for Israel, and given them the victory.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Not long after the, Lysias the king's protector and cousin, who also managed the affairs, took sore displeasure for the things that were done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he had gathered about fourscore thousand with all the horsemen, he came against the Jews, thinking to make the city an habitation of the Gentiles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And to make a gain of the temple, as of the other chapels of the heathen, and to set the high priesthood to sale every year:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Not at all considering the power of God but puffed up with his ten thousands of footmen, and his thousands of horsemen, and his fourscore elephants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he came to Judea, and drew near to Bethsura, which was a strong town, but distant from Jerusalem about five furlongs, and he laid sore siege unto it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when they that were with Maccabeus heard that he besieged the holds, they and all the people with lamentation and tears besought the Lord that he would send a good angel to deliver Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Maccabeus himself first of all took weapons, exhorting the other that they would jeopard themselves together with him to help their brethren: so they went forth together with a willing mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And as they were at Jerusalem, there appeared before them on horseback one in white clothing, shaking his armour of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then they praised the merciful God all together, and took heart, insomuch that they were ready not only to fight with men, but with most cruel beasts, and to pierce through walls of iron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus they marched forward in their armour, having an helper from heaven: for the Lord was merciful unto them</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And giving a charge upon their enemies like lions, they slew eleven thousand footmen, and sixteen hundred horsemen, and put all the other to flight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Many of them also being wounded escaped naked; and Lysias himself fled away shamefully, and so escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Who, as he was a man of understanding, casting with himself what loss he had had, and considering that the Hebrews could not be overcome, because the Almighty God helped them, he sent unto them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And persuaded them to agree to all reasonable conditions, and promised that he would persuade the king that he must needs be a friend unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Maccabeus consented to all that Lysias desired, being careful of the common good; and whatsoever Maccabeus wrote unto Lysias concerning the Jews, the king granted it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For there were letters written unto the Jews from Lysias to this effect: Lysias unto the people of the Jews sendeth greeting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">John and Absolom, who were sent from you, delivered me the petition subscribed, and made request for the performance of the contents thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore what things soever were meet to be reported to the king, I have declared them, and he hath granted as much as might be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And if then ye will keep yourselves loyal to the state, hereafter also will I endeavour to be a means of your good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But of the particulars I have given order both to these and the other that came from me, to commune with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Fare ye well. The hundred and eight and fortieth year, the four and twentieth day of the month Dioscorinthius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now the king's letter contained these words: King Antiochus unto his brother Lysias sendeth greeting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Since our father is translated unto the gods, our will is, that they that are in our realm live quietly, that every one may attend upon his own affairs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">We understand also that the Jews would not consent to our father, for to be brought unto the custom of the Gentiles, but had rather keep their own manner of living: for the which cause they require of us, that we should suffer them to live after their own laws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Wherefore our mind is, that this nation shall be in rest, and we have determined to restore them their temple, that they may live according to the customs of their forefathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Thou shalt do well therefore to send unto them, and grant them peace, that when they are certified of our mind, they may be of good comfort, and ever go cheerfully about their own affairs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the letter of the king unto the nation of the Jews was after this manner: King Antiochus sendeth greeting unto the council, and the rest of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">If ye fare well, we have our desire; we are also in good health.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Menelans declared unto us, that your desire was to return home, and to follow your own business:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Wherefore they that will depart shall have safe conduct till the thirtieth day of Xanthicus with security.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the Jews shall use their own kind of meats and laws, as before; and none of them any manner of ways shall be molested for things ignorantly done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I have sent also Menelans, that he may comfort you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Fare ye well. In the hundred forty and eighth year, and the fifteenth day of the month Xanthicus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The Romans also sent unto them a letter containing these words: Quintus Memmius and Titus Manlius, ambassadors of the Romans, send greeting unto the people of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Whatsoever Lysias the king's cousin hath granted, therewith we also are well pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But touching such things as he judged to be referred to the king, after ye have advised thereof, send one forthwith, that we may declare as it is convenient for you: for we are now going to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Therefore send some with speed, that we may know what is your mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Farewell. This hundred and eight and fortieth year, the fifteenth day of the month Xanthicus.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When these covenants were made, Lysias went unto the king, and the Jews were about their husbandry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But of the governours of several places, Timotheus, and Apollonius the son of Genneus, also Hieronymus, and Demophon, and beside them Nicanor the governor of Cyprus, would not suffer them to be quiet and live in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The men of Joppa also did such an ungodly deed: they prayed the Jews that dwelt among them to go with their wives and children into the boats which they had prepared, as though they had meant them no hurt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Who accepted of it according to the common decree of the city, as being desirous to live in peace, and suspecting nothing: but when they were gone forth into the deep, they drowned no less than two hundred of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Judas heard of this cruelty done unto his countrymen, he commanded those that were with him to make them ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And calling upon God the righteous Judge, he came against those murderers of his brethren, and burnt the haven by night, and set the boats on fire, and those that fled thither he slew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when the town was shut up, he went backward, as if he would return to root out all them of the city of Joppa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But when he heard that the Jamnites were minded to do in like manner unto the Jews that dwelt among them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He came upon the Jamnites also by night, and set fire on the haven and the navy, so that the light of the fire was seen at Jerusalem two hundred and forty furlongs off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now when they were gone from thence nine furlongs in their journey toward Timotheus, no fewer than five thousand men on foot and five hundred horsemen of the Arabians set upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Whereupon there was a very sore battle; but Judas' side by the help of God got the victory; so that the Nomades of Arabia, being overcome, besought Judas for peace, promising both to give him cattle, and to pleasure him otherwise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Judas, thinking indeed that they would be profitable in many things, granted them peace: whereupon they shook hands, and so they departed to their tents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He went also about to make a bridge to a certain strong city, which was fenced about with walls, and inhabited by people of divers countries; and the name of it was Caspis.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But they that were within it put such trust in the strength of the walls and provision of victuals, that they behaved themselves rudely toward them that were with Judas, railing and blaspheming, and uttering such words as were not to be spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Wherefore Judas with his company, calling upon the great Lord of the world, who without rams or engines of war did cast down Jericho in the time of Joshua, gave a fierce assault against the walls,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And took the city by the will of God, and made unspeakable slaughters, insomuch that a lake two furlongs broad near adjoining thereunto, being filled full, was seen running with blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then departed they from thence seven hundred and fifty furlongs, and came to Characa unto the Jews that are called Tubieni.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But as for Timotheus, they found him not in the places: for before he had dispatched any thing, he departed from thence, having left a very strong garrison in a certain hold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Howbeit Dositheus and Sosipater, who were of Maccabeus' captains, went forth, and slew those that Timotheus had left in the fortress, above ten thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Maccabeus ranged his army by bands, and set them over the bands, and went against Timotheus, who had about him an hundred and twenty thousand men of foot, and two thousand and five hundred horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now when Timotheus had knowledge of Judas' coming, he sent the women and children and the other baggage unto a fortress called Carnion: for the town was hard to besiege, and uneasy to come unto, by reason of the straitness of all the places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when Judas his first band came in sight, the enemies, being smitten with fear and terror through the appearing of him who seeth all things, fled amain, one running into this way, another that way, so as that they were often hurt of their own men, and wounded with the points of their own swords.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Judas also was very earnest in pursuing them, killing those wicked wretches, of whom he slew about thirty thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Moreover Timotheus himself fell into the hands of Dositheus and Sosipater, whom he besought with much craft to let him go with his life, because he had many of the Jews' parents, and the brethren of some of them, who, if they put him to death, should not be regarded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So when he had assured them with many words that he would restore them without hurt, according to the agreement, they let him go for the saving of their brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Maccabeus marched forth to Carnion, and to the temple of Atargatis, and there he slew five and twenty thousand persons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And after he had put to flight and destroyed them, Judas removed the host toward Ephron, a strong city, wherein Lysias abode, and a great multitude of divers nations, and the strong young men kept the walls, and defended them mightily: wherein also was great provision of engines and darts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But when Judas and his company had called upon Almighty God, who with his power breaketh the strength of his enemies, they won the city, and slew twenty and five thousand of them that were within,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">From thence they departed to Scythopolis, which lieth six hundred furlongs from Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But when the Jews that dwelt there had testified that the Scythopolitans dealt lovingly with them, and entreated them kindly in the time of their adversity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They gave them thanks, desiring them to be friendly still unto them: and so they came to Jerusalem, the feast of the weeks approaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And after the feast, called Pentecost, they went forth against Gorgias the governor of Idumea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who came out with three thousand men of foot and four hundred horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And it happened that in their fighting together a few of the Jews were slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">At which time Dositheus, one of Bacenor's company, who was on horseback, and a strong man, was still upon Gorgias, and taking hold of his coat drew him by force; and when he would have taken that cursed man alive, a horseman of Thracia coming upon him smote off his shoulder, so that Gorgias fled unto Marisa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Now when they that were with Gorgias had fought long, and were weary, Judas called upon the Lord, that he would shew himself to be their helper and leader of the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And with that he began in his own language, and sung psalms with a loud voice, and rushing unawares upon Gorgias' men, he put them to flight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So Judas gathered his host, and came into the city of Odollam, And when the seventh day came, they purified themselves, as the custom was, and kept the sabbath in the same place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And upon the day following, as the use had been, Judas and his company came to take up the bodies of them that were slain, and to bury them with their kinsmen in their fathers' graves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Now under the coats of every one that was slain they found things consecrated to the idols of the Jamnites, which is forbidden the Jews by the law. Then every man saw that this was the cause wherefore they were slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">All men therefore praising the Lord, the righteous Judge, who had opened the things that were hid,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Betook themselves unto prayer, and besought him that the sin committed might wholly be put out of remembrance. Besides, that noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin, forsomuch as they saw before their eyes the things that came to pass for the sins of those that were slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And when he had made a gathering throughout the company to the sum of two thousand drachms of silver, he sent it to Jerusalem to offer a sin offering, doing therein very well and honestly, in that he was mindful of the resurrection:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should have risen again, it had been superfluous and vain to pray for the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And also in that he perceived that there was great favour laid up for those that died godly, it was an holy and good thought. Whereupon he made a reconciliation for the dead, that they might be delivered from sin.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the hundred forty and ninth year it was told Judas, that Antiochus Eupator was coming with a great power into Judea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And with him Lysias his protector, and ruler of his affairs, having either of them a Grecian power of footmen, an hundred and ten thousand, and horsemen five thousand and three hundred, and elephants two and twenty, and three hundred chariots armed with hooks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Menelans also joined himself with them, and with great dissimulation encouraged Antiochus, not for the safeguard of the country, but because he thought to have been made governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the King of kings moved Antiochus' mind against this wicked wretch, and Lysias informed the king that this man was the cause of all mischief, so that the king commanded to bring him unto Berea, and to put him to death, as the manner is in that place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now there was in that place a tower of fifty cubits high, full of ashes, and it had a round instrument which on every side hanged down into the ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And whosoever was condemned of sacrilege, or had committed any other grievous crime, there did all men thrust him unto death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Such a death it happened that wicked man to die, not having so much as burial in the earth; and that most justly:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For inasmuch as he had committed many sins about the altar, whose fire and ashes were holy, he received his death in ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now the king came with a barbarous and haughty mind to do far worse to the Jews, than had been done in his father's time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Which things when Judas perceived, he commanded the multitude to call upon the Lord night and day, that if ever at any other time, he would now also help them, being at the point to be put from their law, from their country, and from the holy temple:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And that he would not suffer the people, that had even now been but a little refreshed, to be in subjection to the blasphemous nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So when they had all done this together, and besought the merciful Lord with weeping and fasting, and lying flat upon the ground three days long, Judas, having exhorted them, commanded they should be in a readiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Judas, being apart with the elders, determined, before the king's host should enter into Judea, and get the city, to go forth and try the matter in fight by the help of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So when he had committed all to the Creator of the world, and exhorted his soldiers to fight manfully, even unto death, for the laws, the temple, the city, the country, and the commonwealth, he camped by Modin:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And having given the watchword to them that were about him, Victory is of God; with the most valiant and choice young men he went in into the king's tent by night, and slew in the camp about four thousand men, and the chiefest of the elephants, with all that were upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And at last they filled the camp with fear and tumult, and departed with good success.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This was done in the break of the day, because the protection of the Lord did help him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now when the king had taken a taste of the manliness of the Jews, he went about to take the holds by policy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And marched toward Bethsura, which was a strong hold of the Jews: but he was put to flight, failed, and lost of his men:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For Judas had conveyed unto them that were in it such things as were necessary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Rhodocus, who was in the Jews' host, disclosed the secrets to the enemies; therefore he was sought out, and when they had gotten him, they put him in prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The king treated with them in Bethsum the second time, gave his hand, took their's, departed, fought with Judas, was overcome;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Heard that Philip, who was left over the affairs in Antioch, was desperately bent, confounded, intreated the Jews, submitted himself, and sware to all equal conditions, agreed with them, and offered sacrifice, honoured the temple, and dealt kindly with the place,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And accepted well of Maccabeus, made him principal governor from Ptolemais unto the Gerrhenians;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Came to Ptolemais: the people there were grieved for the covenants; for they stormed, because they would make their covenants void:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Lysias went up to the judgment seat, said as much as could be in defence of the cause, persuaded, pacified, made them well affected, returned to Antioch. Thus it went touching the king's coming and departing.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After three years was Judas informed, that Demetrius the son of Seleucus, having entered by the haven of Tripolis with a great power and navy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Had taken the country, and killed Antiochus, and Lysias his protector.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now one Alcimus, who had been high priest, and had defiled himself wilfully in the times of their mingling with the Gentiles, seeing that by no means he could save himself, nor have any more access to the holy altar,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Came to king Demetrius in the hundred and one and fiftieth year, presenting unto him a crown of gold, and a palm, and also of the boughs which were used solemnly in the temple: and so that day he held his peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Howbeit having gotten opportunity to further his foolish enterprize, and being called into counsel by Demetrius, and asked how the Jews stood affected, and what they intended, he answered thereunto:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Those of the Jews that he called Assideans, whose captain is Judas Maccabeus, nourish war and are seditious, and will not let the rest be in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore I, being deprived of mine ancestors' honour, I mean the high priesthood, am now come hither:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">First, verily for the unfeigned care I have of things pertaining to the king; and secondly, even for that I intend the good of mine own countrymen: for all our nation is in no small misery through the unadvised dealing of them aforersaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore, O king, seeing knowest all these things, be careful for the country, and our nation, which is pressed on every side, according to the clemency that thou readily shewest unto all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For as long as Judas liveth, it is not possible that the state should be quiet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This was no sooner spoken of him, but others of the king's friends, being maliciously set against Judas, did more incense Demetrius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And forthwith calling Nicanor, who had been master of the elephants, and making him governor over Judea, he sent him forth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Commanding him to slay Judas, and to scatter them that were with him, and to make Alcimus high priest of the great temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the heathen, that had fled out of Judea from Judas, came to Nicanor by flocks, thinking the harm and calamities ot the Jews to be their welfare.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now when the Jews heard of Nicanor's coming, and that the heathen were up against them, they cast earth upon their heads, and made supplication to him that had established his people for ever, and who always helpeth his portion with manifestation of his presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So at the commandment of the captain they removed straightways from thence, and came near unto them at the town of Dessau.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now Simon, Judas' brother, had joined battle with Nicanor, but was somewhat discomfited through the sudden silence of his enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the manliness of them that were with Judas, and the courageousness that they had to fight for their country, durst not try the matter by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Wherefore he sent Posidonius, and Theodotus, and Mattathias, to make peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So when they had taken long advisement thereupon, and the captain had made the multitude acquainted therewith, and it appeared that they were all of one mind, they consented to the covenants,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And appointed a day to meet in together by themselves: and when the day came, and stools were set for either of them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Ludas placed armed men ready in convenient places, lest some treachery should be suddenly practised by the enemies: so they made a peaceable conference.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now Nicanor abode in Jerusalem, and did no hurt, but sent away the people that came flocking unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he would not willingly have Judas out of his sight: for he love the man from his heart</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He prayed him also to take a wife, and to beget children: so he married, was quiet, and took part of this life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But Alcimus, perceiving the love that was betwixt them, and considering the covenants that were made, came to Demetrius, and told him that Nicanor was not well affected toward the state; for that he had ordained Judas, a traitor to his realm, to be the king's successor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the king being in a rage, and provoked with the accusations of the most wicked man, wrote to Nicanor, signifying that he was much displeased with the covenants, and commanding him that he should send Maccabeus prisoner in all haste unto Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When this came to Nicanor's hearing, he was much confounded in himself, and took it grievously that he should make void the articles which were agreed upon, the man being in no fault.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But because there was no dealing against the king, he watched his time to accomplish this thing by policy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Notwithstanding, when Maccabeus saw that Nicanor began to be churlish unto him, and that he entreated him more roughly than he was wont, perceiving that such sour behaviour came not of good, he gathered together not a few of his men, and withdrew himself from Nicanor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But the other, knowing that he was notably prevented by Judas' policy, came into the great and holy temple, and commanded the priests, that were offering their usual sacrifices, to deliver him the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And when they sware that they could not tell where the man was whom he sought,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He stretched out his right hand toward the temple, and made an oath in this manner: If ye will not deliver me Judas as a prisoner, I will lay this temple of God even with the ground, and I will break down the altar, and erect a notable temple unto Bacchus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">After these words he departed. Then the priests lifted up their hands toward heaven, and besought him that was ever a defender of their nation, saying in this manner;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Thou, O Lord of all things, who hast need of nothing, wast pleased that the temple of thine habitation should be among us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Therefore now, O holy Lord of all holiness, keep this house ever undefiled, which lately was cleansed, and stop every unrighteous mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now was there accused unto Nicanor one Razis, one of the elders of Jerusalem, a lover of his countrymen, and a man of very good report, who for his kindness was called a father of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For in the former times, when they mingled not themselves with the Gentiles, he had been accused of Judaism, and did boldly jeopard his body and life with all vehemency for the religion of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">So Nicanor, willing to declare the hate that he bare unto the Jews, sent above five hundred men of war to take him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For he thought by taking him to do the Jews much hurt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now when the multitude would have taken the tower, and violently broken into the outer door, and bade that fire should be brought to burn it, he being ready to be taken on every side fell upon his sword;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Choosing rather to die manfully, than to come into the hands of the wicked, to be abused otherwise than beseemed his noble birth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But missing his stroke through haste, the multitude also rushing within the doors, he ran boldly up to the wall, and cast himself down manfully among the thickest of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But they quickly giving back, and a space being made, he fell down into the midst of the void place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Nevertheless, while there was yet breath within him, being inflamed with anger, he rose up; and though his blood gushed out like spouts of water, and his wounds were grievous, yet he ran through the midst of the throng; and standing upon a steep rock,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">When as his blood was now quite gone, he plucked out his bowels, and taking them in both his hands, he cast them upon the throng, and calling upon the Lord of life and spirit to restore him those again, he thus died.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But Nicanor, hearing that Judas and his company were in the strong places about Samaria, resolved without any danger to set upon them on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Nevertheless the Jews that were compelled to go with him said, O destroy not so cruelly and barbarously, but give honour to that day, which he, that seeth all things, hath honoured with holiness above all other days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the most ungracious wretch demanded, if there were a Mighty one in heaven, that had commanded the sabbath day to be kept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they said, There is in heaven a living Lord, and mighty, who commanded the seventh day to be kept:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said the other, And I also am mighty upon earth, and I command to take arms, and to do the king's business. Yet he obtained not to have his wicked will done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Nicanor in exceeding pride and haughtiness determined to set up a publick monument of his victory over Judas and them that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Maccabeus had ever sure confidence that the Lord would help him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore he exhorted his people not to fear the coming of the heathen against them, but to remember the help which in former times they had received from heaven, and now to expect the victory and aid, which should come unto them from the Almighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And so comforting them out of the law and the prophets, and withal putting them in mind of the battles that they won afore, he made them more cheerful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when he had stirred up their minds, he gave them their charge, shewing them therewithall the falsehood of the heathen, and the breach of oaths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus he armed every one of them, not so much with defence of shields and spears, as with comfortable and good words: and beside that, he told them a dream worthy to be believed, as if it had been so indeed, which did not a little rejoice them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And this was his vision: That Onias, who had been high priest, a virtuous and a good man, reverend in conversation, gentle in condition, well spoken also, and exercised from a child in all points of virtue, holding up his hands prayed for the whole body of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">This done, in like manner there appeared a man with gray hairs, and exceeding glorious, who was of a wonderful and excellent majesty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Onias answered, saying, This is a lover of the brethren, who prayeth much for the people, and for the holy city, to wit, Jeremias the prophet of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Whereupon Jeremias holding forth his right hand gave to Judas a sword of gold, and in giving it spake thus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Take this holy sword, a gift from God, with the which thou shalt wound the adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Thus being well comforted by the words of Judas, which were very good, and able to stir them up to valour, and to encourage the hearts of the young men, they determined not to pitch camp, but courageously to set upon them, and manfully to try the matter by conflict, because the city and the sanctuary and the temple were in danger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the care that they took for their wives, and their children, their brethren, and folks, was in least account with them: but the greatest and principal fear was for the holy temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also they that were in the city took not the least care, being troubled for the conflict abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And now, when as all looked what should be the trial, and the enemies were already come near, and the army was set in array, and the beasts conveniently placed, and the horsemen set in wings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Maccabeus seeing the coming of the multitude, and the divers preparations of armour, and the fierceness of the beasts, stretched out his hands toward heaven, and called upon the Lord that worketh wonders, knowing that victory cometh not by arms, but even as it seemeth good to him, he giveth it to such as are worthy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore in his prayer he said after this manner; O Lord, thou didst send thine angel in the time of Ezekias king of Judea, and didst slay in the host of Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and five thousand:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Wherefore now also, O Lord of heaven, send a good angel before us for a fear and dread unto them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And through the might of thine arm let those be stricken with terror, that come against thy holy people to blaspheme. And he ended thus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Nicanor and they that were with him came forward with trumpets and songs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But Judas and his company encountered the enemies with invocation and prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So that fighting with their hands, and praying unto God with their hearts, they slew no less than thirty and five thousand men: for through the appearance of God they were greatly cheered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now when the battle was done, returning again with joy, they knew that Nicanor lay dead in his harness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then they made a great shout and a noise, praising the Almighty in their own language.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Judas, who was ever the chief defender of the citizens both in body and mind, and who continued his love toward his countrymen all his life, commanded to strike off Nicanor's head, and his hand with his shoulder, and bring them to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So when he was there, and called them of his nation together, and set the priests before the altar, he sent for them that were of the tower,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And shewed them vile Nicanor's head, and the hand of that blasphemer, which with proud brags he had stretched out against the holy temple of the Almighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when he had cut out the tongue of that ungodly Nicanor, he commanded that they should give it by pieces unto the fowls, and hang up the reward of his madness before the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">So every man praised toward the heaven the glorious Lord, saying, Blessed be he that hath kept his own place undefiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He hanged also Nicanor's head upon the tower, an evident and manifest sign unto all of the help of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And they ordained all with a common decree in no case to let that day pass without solemnity, but to celebrate the thirtieth day of the twelfth month, which in the Syrian tongue is called Adar, the day before Mardocheus' day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Thus went it with Nicanor: and from that time forth the Hebrews had the city in their power. And here will I make an end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And if I have done well, and as is fitting the story, it is that which I desired: but if slenderly and meanly, it is that which I could attain unto.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For as it is hurtful to drink wine or water alone; and as wine mingled with water is pleasant, and delighteth the taste: even so speech finely framed delighteth the ears of them that read the story. And here shall be an end.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Josias held the feast of the passover in Jerusalem unto his Lord, and offered the passover the fourteenth day of the first month;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Having set the priests according to their daily courses, being arrayed in long garments, in the temple of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he spake unto the Levites, the holy ministers of Israel, that they should hallow themselves unto the Lord, to set the holy ark of the Lord in the house that king Solomon the son of David had built:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And said, Ye shall no more bear the ark upon your shoulders: now therefore serve the Lord your God, and minister unto his people Israel, and prepare you after your families and kindreds,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">According as David the king of Israel prescribed, and according to the magnificence of Solomon his son: and standing in the temple according to the several dignity of the families of you the Levites, who minister in the presence of your brethren the children of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Offer the passover in order, and make ready the sacrifices for your brethren, and keep the passover according to the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And unto the people that was found there Josias gave thirty thousand lambs and kids, and three thousand calves: these things were given of the king's allowance, according as he promised, to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Helkias, Zacharias, and Syelus, the governors of the temple, gave to the priests for the passover two thousand and six hundred sheep, and three hundred calves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jeconias, and Samaias, and Nathanael his brother, and Assabias, and Ochiel, and Joram, captains over thousands, gave to the Levites for the passover five thousand sheep, and seven hundred calves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when these things were done, the priests and Levites, having the unleavened bread, stood in very comely order according to the kindreds,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And according to the several dignities of the fathers, before the people, to offer to the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses: and thus did they in the morning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they roasted the passover with fire, as appertaineth: as for the sacrifices, they sod them in brass pots and pans with a good savour,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And set them before all the people: and afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the priests offered the fat until night: and the Levites prepared for themselves, and the priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The holy singers also, the sons of Asaph, were in their order, according to the appointment of David, to wit, Asaph, Zacharias, and Jeduthun, who was of the king's retinue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Moreover the porters were at every gate; it was not lawful for any to go from his ordinary service: for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Thus were the things that belonged to the sacrifices of the Lord accomplished in that day, that they might hold the passover,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And offer sacrifices upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of king Josias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So the children of Israel which were present held the passover at that time, and the feast of sweet bread seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And such a passover was not kept in Israel since the time of the prophet Samuel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yea, all the kings of Israel held not such a passover as Josias, and the priests, and the Levites, and the Jews, held with all Israel that were found dwelling at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this passover kept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the works or Josias were upright before his Lord with an heart full of godliness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">As for the things that came to pass in his time, they were written in former times, concerning those that sinned, and did wickedly against the Lord above all people and kingdoms, and how they grieved him exceedingly, so that the words of the Lord rose up against Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now after all these acts of Josias it came to pass, that Pharaoh the king of Egypt came to raise war at Carchamis upon Euphrates: and Josias went out against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the king of Egypt sent to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, O king of Judea?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I am not sent out from the Lord God against thee; for my war is upon Euphrates: and now the Lord is with me, yea, the Lord is with me hasting me forward: depart from me, and be not against the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Howbeit Josias did not turn back his chariot from him, but undertook to fight with him, not regarding the words of the prophet Jeremy spoken by the mouth of the Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But joined battle with him in the plain of Magiddo, and the princes came against king Josias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then said the king unto his servants, Carry me away out of the battle; for I am very weak. And immediately his servants took him away out of the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then gat he up upon his second chariot; and being brought back to Jerusalem died, and was buried in his father's sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And in all Jewry they mourned for Josias, yea, Jeremy the prophet lamented for Josias, and the chief men with the women made lamentation for him unto this day: and this was given out for an ordinance to be done continually in all the nation of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">These things are written in the book of the stories of the kings of Judah, and every one of the acts that Josias did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord, and the things that he had done before, and the things now recited, are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the people took Joachaz the son of Josias, and made him king instead of Josias his father, when he was twenty and three years old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he reigned in Judea and in Jerusalem three months: and then the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he set a tax upon the land of an hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The king of Egypt also made king Joacim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he bound Joacim and the nobles: but Zaraces his brother he apprehended, and brought him out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Five and twenty years old was Joacim when he was made king in the land of Judea and Jerusalem; and he did evil before the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Wherefore against him Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came up, and bound him with a chain of brass, and carried him into Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Nabuchodonosor also took of the holy vessels of the Lord, and carried them away, and set them in his own temple at Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But those things that are recorded of him, and of his uncleaness and impiety, are written in the chronicles of the kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Joacim his son reigned in his stead: he was made king being eighteen years old;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And reigned but three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and did evil before the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">So after a year Nabuchodonosor sent and caused him to be brought into Babylon with the holy vessels of the Lord;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And made Zedechias king of Judea and Jerusalem, when he was one and twenty years old; and he reigned eleven years:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And he did evil also in the sight of the Lord, and cared not for the words that were spoken unto him by the prophet Jeremy from the mouth of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And after that king Nabuchodonosor had made him to swear by the name of the Lord, he forswore himself, and rebelled; and hardening his neck, his heart, he transgressed the laws of the Lord God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The governors also of the people and of the priests did many things against the laws, and passed all the pollutions of all nations, and defiled the temple of the Lord, which was sanctified in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Nevertheless the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to call them back, because he spared them and his tabernacle also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">But they had his messengers in derision; and, look, when the Lord spake unto them, they made a sport of his prophets:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">So far forth, that he, being wroth with his people for their great ungodliness, commanded the kings of the Chaldees to come up against them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Who slew their young men with the sword, yea, even within the compass of their holy temple, and spared neither young man nor maid, old man nor child, among them; for he delivered all into their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king's treasures, and carried them away into Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">As for the house of the Lord, they burnt it, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem, and set fire upon her towers:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And as for her glorious things, they never ceased till they had consumed and brought them all to nought: and the people that were not slain with the sword he carried unto Babylon:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Who became servants to him and his children, till the Persians reigned, to fulfil the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths, the whole time of her desolation shall she rest, until the full term of seventy years.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord might be accomplished, that he had promised by the mouth of Jeremy;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Lord raised up the spirit of Cyrus the king of the Persians, and he made proclamation through all his kingdom, and also by writing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Saying, Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians; The Lord of Israel, the most high Lord, hath made me king of the whole world,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And commanded me to build him an house at Jerusalem in Jewry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">If therefore there be any of you that are of his people, let the Lord, even his Lord, be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem that is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord of Israel: for he is the Lord that dwelleth in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Whosoever then dwell in the places about, let them help him, those, I say, that are his neighbours, with gold, and with silver,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">With gifts, with horses, and with cattle, and other things, which have been set forth by vow, for the temple of the Lord at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the chief of the families of Judea and of the tribe of Benjamin stood up; the priests also, and the Levites, and all they whose mind the Lord had moved to go up, and to build an house for the Lord at Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they that dwelt round about them, and helped them in all things with silver and gold, with horses and cattle, and with very many free gifts of a great number whose minds were stirred up thereto.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">King Cyrus also brought forth the holy vessels, which Nabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem, and had set up in his temple of idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when Cyrus king of the Persians had brought them forth, he delivered them to Mithridates his treasurer:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And by him they were delivered to Sanabassar the governor of Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And this was the number of them; A thousand golden cups, and a thousand of silver, censers of silver twenty nine, vials of gold thirty, and of silver two thousand four hundred and ten, and a thousand other vessels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So all the vessels of gold and of silver, which were carried away, were five thousand four hundred threescore and nine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">These were brought back by Sanabassar, together with them of the captivity, from Babylon to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But in the time of Artexerxes king of the Persians Belemus, and Mithridates, and Tabellius, and Rathumus, and Beeltethmus, and Semellius the secretary, with others that were in commission with them, dwelling in Samaria and other places, wrote unto him against them that dwelt in Judea and Jerusalem these letters following;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">To king Artexerxes our lord, Thy servants, Rathumus the storywriter, and Semellius the scribe, and the rest of their council, and the judges that are in Celosyria and Phenice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Be it now known to the lord king, that the Jews that are up from you to us, being come into Jerusalem, that rebellious and wicked city, do build the marketplaces, and repair the walls of it and do lay the foundation of the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now if this city and the walls thereof be made up again, they will not only refuse to give tribute, but also rebel against kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And forasmuch as the things pertaining to the temple are now in hand, we think it meet not to neglect such a matter,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But to speak unto our lord the king, to the intent that, if it be thy pleasure it may be sought out in the books of thy fathers:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And thou shalt find in the chronicles what is written concerning these things, and shalt understand that that city was rebellious, troubling both kings and cities:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And that the Jews were rebellious, and raised always wars therein; for the which cause even this city was made desolate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Wherefore now we do declare unto thee, O lord the king, that if this city be built again, and the walls thereof set up anew, thou shalt from henceforth have no passage into Celosyria and Phenice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then the king wrote back again to Rathumus the storywriter, to Beeltethmus, to Semellius the scribe, and to the rest that were in commission, and dwellers in Samaria and Syria and Phenice, after this manner;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I have read the epistle which ye have sent unto me: therefore I commanded to make diligent search, and it hath been found that that city was from the beginning practising against kings;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the men therein were given to rebellion and war: and that mighty kings and fierce were in Jerusalem, who reigned and exacted tributes in Celosyria and Phenice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now therefore I have commanded to hinder those men from building the city, and heed to be taken that there be no more done in it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And that those wicked workers proceed no further to the annoyance of kings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then king Artexerxes his letters being read, Rathumus, and Semellius the scribe, and the rest that were in commission with them, removing in haste toward Jerusalem with a troop of horsemen and a multitude of people in battle array, began to hinder the builders; and the building of the temple in Jerusalem ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Darius reigned, he made a great feast unto all his subjects, and unto all his household, and unto all the princes of Media and Persia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And to all the governors and captains and lieutenants that were under him, from India unto Ethiopia, of an hundred twenty and seven provinces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when they had eaten and drunken, and being satisfied were gone home, then Darius the king went into his bedchamber, and slept, and soon after awaked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then three young men, that were of the guard that kept the king's body, spake one to another;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let every one of us speak a sentence: he that shall overcome, and whose sentence shall seem wiser than the others, unto him shall the king Darius give great gifts, and great things in token of victory:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As, to be clothed in purple, to drink in gold, and to sleep upon gold, and a chariot with bridles of gold, and an headtire of fine linen, and a chain about his neck:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called Darius his cousin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And then every one wrote his sentence, sealed it, and laid it under king Darius his pillow;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And said that, when the king is risen, some will give him the writings; and of whose side the king and the three princes of Persia shall judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victory be given, as was appointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The first wrote, Wine is the strongest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The second wrote, The king is strongest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The third wrote, Women are strongest: but above all things Truth beareth away the victory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when the king was risen up, they took their writings, and delivered them unto him, and so he read them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And sending forth he called all the princes of Persia and Media, and the governors, and the captains, and the lieutenants, and the chief officers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And sat him down in the royal seat of judgment; and the writings were read before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said, Call the young men, and they shall declare their own sentences. So they were called, and came in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said unto them, Declare unto us your mind concerning the writings. Then began the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said thus, O ye men, how exceeding strong is wine! it causeth all men to err that drink it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">It turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And it maketh every heart rich, so that a man remembereth neither king nor governor; and it maketh to speak all things by talents:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and brethren, and a little after draw out swords:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But when they are from the wine, they remember not what they have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">O ye men, is not wine the strongest, that enforceth to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the second, that had spoken of the strength of the king, began to say,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">O ye men, do not men excel in strength that bear rule over sea and land and all things in them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But yet the king is more mighty: for he is lord of all these things, and hath dominion over them; and whatsoever he commandeth them they do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If he bid them make war the one against the other, they do it: if he send them out against the enemies, they go, and break down mountains walls and towers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They slay and are slain, and transgress not the king's commandment: if they get the victory, they bring all to the king, as well the spoil, as all things else.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Likewise for those that are no soldiers, and have not to do with wars, but use husbundry, when they have reaped again that which they had sown, they bring it to the king, and compel one another to pay tribute unto the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And yet he is but one man: if he command to kill, they kill; if he command to spare, they spare;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If he command to smite, they smite; if he command to make desolate, they make desolate; if he command to build, they build;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If he command to cut down, they cut down; if he command to plant, they plant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So all his people and his armies obey him: furthermore he lieth down, he eateth and drinketh, and taketh his rest:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And these keep watch round about him, neither may any one depart, and do his own business, neither disobey they him in any thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">O ye men, how should not the king be mightiest, when in such sort he is obeyed? And he held his tongue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the third, who had spoken of women, and of the truth, (this was Zorobabel) began to speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">O ye men, it is not the great king, nor the multitude of men, neither is it wine, that excelleth; who is it then that ruleth them, or hath the lordship over them? are they not women?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Women have borne the king and all the people that bear rule by sea and land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Even of them came they: and they nourished them up that planted the vineyards, from whence the wine cometh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These also make garments for men; these bring glory unto men; and without women cannot men be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yea, and if men have gathered together gold and silver, or any other goodly thing, do they not love a woman which is comely in favour and beauty?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And letting all those things go, do they not gape, and even with open mouth fix their eyes fast on her; and have not all men more desire unto her than unto silver or gold, or any goodly thing whatsoever?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">A man leaveth his own father that brought him up, and his own country, and cleaveth unto his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He sticketh not to spend his life with his wife. and remembereth neither father, nor mother, nor country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">By this also ye must know that women have dominion over you: do ye not labour and toil, and give and bring all to the woman?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Yea, a man taketh his sword, and goeth his way to rob and to steal, to sail upon the sea and upon rivers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And looketh upon a lion, and goeth in the darkness; and when he hath stolen, spoiled, and robbed, he bringeth it to his love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Wherefore a man loveth his wife better than father or mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Yea, many there be that have run out of their wits for women, and become servants for their sakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Many also have perished, have erred, and sinned, for women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And now do ye not believe me? is not the king great in his power? do not all regions fear to touch him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Yet did I see him and Apame the king's concubine, the daughter of the admirable Bartacus, sitting at the right hand of the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And taking the crown from the king's head, and setting it upon her own head; she also struck the king with her left hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And yet for all this the king gaped and gazed upon her with open mouth: if she laughed upon him, he laughed also: but if she took any displeasure at him, the king was fain to flatter, that she might be reconciled to him again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">O ye men, how can it be but women should be strong, seeing they do thus?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the king and the princes looked one upon another: so he began to speak of the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">O ye men, are not women strong? great is the earth, high is the heaven, swift is the sun in his course, for he compasseth the heavens round about, and fetcheth his course again to his own place in one day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">For Esdras had very great skill, so that he omitted nothing of the law and commandments of the Lord, but taught all Israel the ordinances and judgments.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">King Artexerxes unto Esdras the priest and reader of the law of the Lord sendeth greeting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Having determined to deal graciously, I have given order, that such of the nation of the Jews, and of the priests and Levites being within our realm, as are willing and desirous should go with thee unto Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As many therefore as have a mind thereunto, let them depart with thee, as it hath seemed good both to me and my seven friends the counsellors;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And carry the gifts unto the Lord of Israel to Jerusalem, which I and my friends have vowed, and all the gold and silver that in the country of Babylon can be found, to the Lord in Jerusalem,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And whatsoever thou and thy brethren will do with the silver and gold, that do, according to the will of thy God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the holy vessels of the Lord, which are given thee for the use of the temple of thy God, which is in Jerusalem, thou shalt set before thy God in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And whatsoever thing else thou shalt remember for the use of the temple of thy God, thou shalt give it out of the king's treasury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I king Artexerxes have also commanded the keepers of the treasures in Syria and Phenice, that whatsoever Esdras the priest and the reader of the law of the most high God shall send for, they should give it him with speed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">To the sum of an hundred talents of silver, likewise also of wheat even to an hundred cors, and an hundred pieces of wine, and other things in abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Let all things be performed after the law of God diligently unto the most high God, that wrath come not upon the kingdom of the king and his sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">I command you also, that ye require no tax, nor any other imposition, of any of the priests, or Levites, or holy singers, or porters, or ministers of the temple, or of any that have doings in this temple, and that no man have authority to impose any thing upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And thou, Esdras, according to the wisdom of God ordain judges and justices, that they may judge in all Syria and Phenice all those that know the law of thy God; and those that know it not thou shalt teach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And whosoever shall transgress the law of thy God, and of the king, shall be punished diligently, whether it be by death, or other punishment, by penalty of money, or by imprisonment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then said Esdras the scribe, Blessed be the only Lord God of my fathers, who hath put these things into the heart of the king, to glorify his house that is in Jerusalem:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">Of the sons of Bago, Uthi the son of Istalcurus, and with him seventy men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And these I gathered together to the river called Theras, where we pitched our tents three days: and then I surveyed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But when I had found there none of the priests and Levites,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then sent I unto Eleazar, and Iduel, and Masman,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And Alnathan, and Mamaias, and Joribas, and Nathan, Eunatan, Zacharias, and Mosollamon, principal men and learned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And I bade them that they should go unto Saddeus the captain, who was in the place of the treasury:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And commanded them that they should speak unto Daddeus, and to his brethren, and to the treasurers in that place, to send us such men as might execute the priests' office in the house of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And by the mighty hand of our Lord they brought unto us skilful men of the sons of Moli the son of Levi, the son of Israel, Asebebia, and his sons, and his brethren, who were eighteen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And Asebia, and Annus, and Osaias his brother, of the sons of Channuneus, and their sons, were twenty men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And of the servants of the temple whom David had ordained, and the principal men for the service of the Levites to wit, the servants of the temple two hundred and twenty, the catalogue of whose names were shewed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And there I vowed a fast unto the young men before our Lord, to desire of him a prosperous journey both for us and them that were with us, for our children, and for the cattle:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">For I was ashamed to ask the king footmen, and horsemen, and conduct for safeguard against our adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">For we had said unto the king, that the power of the Lord our God should be with them that seek him, to support them in all ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And again we besought our Lord as touching these things, and found him favourable unto us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Esebrias, and Assanias, and ten men of their brethren with them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And I weighed them the gold, and the silver, and the holy vessels of the house of our Lord, which the king, and his council, and the princes, and all Israel, had given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And when I had weighed it, I delivered unto them six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels of an hundred talents, and an hundred talents of gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And twenty golden vessels, and twelve vessels of brass, even of fine brass, glittering like gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And I said unto them, Both ye are holy unto the Lord, and the vessels are holy, and the gold and the silver is a vow unto the Lord, the Lord of our fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Watch ye, and keep them till ye deliver them to the chief of the priests and Levites, and to the principal men of the families of Israel, in Jerusalem, into the chambers of the house of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">So the priests and the Levites, who had received the silver and the gold and the vessels, brought them unto Jerusalem, into the temple of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And from the river Theras we departed the twelfth day of the first month, and came to Jerusalem by the mighty hand of our Lord, which was with us: and from the beginning of our journey the Lord delivered us from every enemy, and so we came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And when we had been there three days, the gold and silver that was weighed was delivered in the house of our Lord on the fourth day unto Marmoth the priest the son of Iri.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">And with him was Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them were Josabad the son of Jesu and Moeth the son of Sabban, Levites: all was delivered them by number and weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">And all the weight of them was written up the same hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Moreover they that were come out of the captivity offered sacrifice unto the Lord God of Israel, even twelve bullocks for all Israel, fourscore and sixteen rams,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">Threescore and twelve lambs, goats for a peace offering, twelve; all of them a sacrifice to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">And they delivered the king's commandments unto the king's stewards' and to the governors of Celosyria and Phenice; and they honoured the people and the temple of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">Now when these things were done, the rulers came unto me, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">The nation of Israel, the princes, the priests and Levites, have not put away from them the strange people of the land, nor the pollutions of the Gentiles to wit, of the Canaanites, Hittites, Pheresites, Jebusites, and the Moabites, Egyptians, and Edomites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">For both they and their sons have married with their daughters, and the holy seed is mixed with the strange people of the land; and from the beginning of this matter the rulers and the great men have been partakers of this iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And as soon as I had heard these things, I rent my clothes, and the holy garment, and pulled off the hair from off my head and beard, and sat me down sad and very heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">So all they that were then moved at the word of the Lord God of Israel assembled unto me, whilst I mourned for the iniquity: but I sat still full of heaviness until the evening sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">Then rising up from the fast with my clothes and the holy garment rent, and bowing my knees, and stretching forth my hands unto the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">I said, O Lord, I am confounded and ashamed before thy face;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">For our sins are multiplied above our heads, and our ignorances have reached up unto heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="76">For ever since the time of our fathers we have been and are in great sin, even unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="77">And for our sins and our fathers' we with our brethren and our kings and our priests were given up unto the kings of the earth, to the sword, and to captivity, and for a prey with shame, unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="78">And now in some measure hath mercy been shewed unto us from thee, O Lord, that there should be left us a root and a name in the place of thy sanctuary;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="79">And to discover unto us a light in the house of the Lord our God, and to give us food in the time of our servitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="80">Yea, when we were in bondage, we were not forsaken of our Lord; but he made us gracious before the kings of Persia, so that they gave us food;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="81">Yea, and honoured the temple of our Lord, and raised up the desolate Sion, that they have given us a sure abiding in Jewry and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="82">And now, O Lord, what shall we say, having these things? for we have transgressed thy commandments, which thou gavest by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="83">That the land, which ye enter into to possess as an heritage, is a land polluted with the pollutions of the strangers of the land, and they have filled it with their uncleanness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="84">Therefore now shall ye not join your daughters unto their sons, neither shall ye take their daughters unto your sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="85">Moreover ye shall never seek to have peace with them, that ye may be strong, and eat the good things of the land, and that ye may leave the inheritance of the land unto your children for evermore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="86">And all that is befallen is done unto us for our wicked works and great sins; for thou, O Lord, didst make our sins light,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="87">And didst give unto us such a root: but we have turned back again to transgress thy law, and to mingle ourselves with the uncleanness of the nations of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="88">Mightest not thou be angry with us to destroy us, till thou hadst left us neither root, seed, nor name?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="89">O Lord of Israel, thou art true: for we are left a root this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="90">Behold, now are we before thee in our iniquities, for we cannot stand any longer by reason of these things before thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="91">And as Esdras in his prayer made his confession, weeping, and lying flat upon the ground before the temple, there gathered unto him from Jerusalem a very great multitude of men and women and children: for there was great weeping among the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="92">Then Jechonias the son of Jeelus, one of the sons of Israel, called out, and said, O Esdras, we have sinned against the Lord God, we have married strange women of the nations of the land, and now is all Israel aloft.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="93">Let us make an oath to the Lord, that we will put away all our wives, which we have taken of the heathen, with their children,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="94">Like as thou hast decreed, and as many as do obey the law of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="95">Arise and put in execution: for to thee doth this matter appertain, and we will be with thee: do valiantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="96">So Esdras arose, and took an oath of the chief of the priests and Levites of all Israel to do after these things; and so they sware.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Esdras rising from the court of the temple went to the chamber of Joanan the son of Eliasib,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And remained there, and did eat no meat nor drink water, mourning for the great iniquities of the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And there was a proclamation in all Jewry and Jerusalem to all them that were of the captivity, that they should be gathered together at Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And that whosoever met not there within two or three days according as the elders that bare rule appointed, their cattle should be seized to the use of the temple, and himself cast out from them that were of the captivity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And in three days were all they of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem the twentieth day of the ninth month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And all the multitude sat trembling in the broad court of the temple because of the present foul weather.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Esdras arose up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed the law in marrying strange wives, thereby to increase the sins of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And now by confessing give glory unto the Lord God of our fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And do his will, and separate yourselves from the heathen of the land, and from the strange women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then cried the whole multitude, and said with a loud voice, Like as thou hast spoken, so will we do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But forasmuch as the people are many, and it is foul weather, so that we cannot stand without, and this is not a work of a day or two, seeing our sin in these things is spread far:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore let the rulers of the multitude stay, and let all them of our habitations that have strange wives come at the time appointed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And with them the rulers and judges of every place, till we turn away the wrath of the Lord from us for this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Jonathan the son of Azael and Ezechias the son of Theocanus accordingly took this matter upon them: and Mosollam and Levis and Sabbatheus helped them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they that were of the captivity did according to all these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Esdras the priest chose unto him the principal men of their families, all by name: and in the first day of the tenth month they sat together to examine the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So their cause that held strange wives was brought to an end in the first day of the first month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And of the priests that were come together, and had strange wives, there were found:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Of the sons of Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren; Matthelas and Eleazar, and Joribus and Joadanus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they gave their hands to put away their wives and to offer rams to make reconcilement for their errors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And of the sons of Emmer; Ananias, and Zabdeus, and Eanes, and Sameius, and Hiereel, and Azarias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And of the sons of Phaisur; Elionas, Massias Israel, and Nathanael, and Ocidelus and Talsas.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">And of the sons of Ethma; Mazitias, Zabadaias, Edes, Juel, Banaias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">All these had taken strange wives, and they put them away with their children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the priests and Levites, and they that were of Israel, dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the country, in the first day of the seventh month: so the children of Israel were in their habitations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the whole multitude came together with one accord into the broad place of the holy porch toward the east:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they spake unto Esdras the priest and reader, that he would bring the law of Moses, that was given of the Lord God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So Esdras the chief priest brought the law unto the whole multitude from man to woman, and to all the priests, to hear law in the first day of the seventh month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he read in the broad court before the holy porch from morning unto midday, before both men and women; and the multitude gave heed unto the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Esdras the priest and reader of the law stood up upon a pulpit of wood, which was made for that purpose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And there stood up by him Mattathias, Sammus, Ananias, Azarias, Urias, Ezecias, Balasamus, upon the right hand:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And upon his left hand stood Phaldaius, Misael, Melchias, Lothasubus, and Nabarias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then took Esdras the book of the law before the multitude: for he sat honourably in the first place in the sight of them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And when he opened the law, they stood all straight up. So Esdras blessed the Lord God most High, the God of hosts, Almighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And all the people answered, Amen; and lifting up their hands they fell to the ground, and worshipped the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Also Jesus, Anus, Sarabias, Adinus, Jacubus, Sabateas, Auteas, Maianeas, and Calitas, Asrias, and Joazabdus, and Ananias, Biatas, the Levites, taught the law of the Lord, making them withal to understand it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Then spake Attharates unto Esdras the chief priest. and reader, and to the Levites that taught the multitude, even to all, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">This day is holy unto the Lord; (for they all wept when they heard the law:)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Go then, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send part to them that have nothing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">For this day is holy unto the Lord: and be not sorrowful; for the Lord will bring you to honour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So the Levites published all things to the people, saying, This day is holy to the Lord; be not sorrowful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Then went they their way, every one to eat and drink, and make merry, and to give part to them that had nothing, and to make great cheer;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed; who hast made heaven and earth, with all the ornament thereof; who hast bound the sea by the word of thy commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and sealed it by thy terrible and glorious name; whom all men fear, and tremble before thy power; for the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, and thine angry threatening toward sinners is importable: but thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable; for thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion, longsuffering, very merciful, and repentest of the evils of men. Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that have sinned against thee: and of thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that they may be saved. Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against thee; but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner: for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied: my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of mine iniquities. I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot life up mine head, neither have any release: for I have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee: I did not thy will, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set up abominations, and have multiplied offences. Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace. I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities: wherefore, I humbly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquites. Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me to the lower parts of the earth. For thou art the God, even the God of them that repent; and in me thou wilt shew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy. Therefore I will praise thee for ever all the days of my life: for all the powers of the heavens do praise thee, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city I was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over my heart:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them that dwelt at Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And my spirit was sore moved, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the most High, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">O Lord, who bearest rule, thou spakest at the beginning, when thou didst plant the earth, and that thyself alone, and commandedst the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And gavest a body unto Adam without soul, which was the workmanship of thine hands, and didst breathe into him the breath of life, and he was made living before thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And thou leadest him into paradise, which thy right hand had planted, before ever the earth came forward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And unto him thou gavest commandment to love thy way: which he transgressed, and immediately thou appointedst death in him and in his generations, of whom came nations, tribes, people, and kindreds, out of number.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And every people walked after their own will, and did wonderful things before thee, and despised thy commandments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And again in process of time thou broughtest the flood upon those that dwelt in the world, and destroyedst them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And it came to pass in every of them, that as death was to Adam, so was the flood to these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Nevertheless one of them thou leftest, namely, Noah with his household, of whom came all righteous men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it happened, that when they that dwelt upon the earth began to multiply, and had gotten them many children, and were a great people, they began again to be more ungodly than the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when they lived so wickedly before thee, thou didst choose thee a man from among them, whose name was Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Him thou lovedst, and unto him only thou shewedst thy will:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And madest an everlasting covenant with him, promising him that thou wouldest never forsake his seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And unto him thou gavest Isaac, and unto Isaac also thou gavest Jacob and Esau. As for Jacob, thou didst choose him to thee, and put by Esau: and so Jacob became a great multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, that when thou leadest his seed out of Egypt, thou broughtest them up to the mount Sinai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And bowing the heavens, thou didst set fast the earth, movedst the whole world, and madest the depths to tremble, and troubledst the men of that age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And thy glory went through four gates, of fire, and of earthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that thou mightest give the law unto the seed of Jacob, and diligence unto the generation of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And yet tookest thou not away from them a wicked heart, that thy law might bring forth fruit in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the first Adam bearing a wicked heart transgressed, and was overcome; and so be all they that are born of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Thus infirmity was made permanent; and the law (also) in the heart of the people with the malignity of the root; so that the good departed away, and the evil abode still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end: then didst thou raise thee up a servant, called David:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Whom thou commandedst to build a city unto thy name, and to offer incense and oblations unto thee therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When this was done many years, then they that inhabited the city forsook thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And in all things did even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also had a wicked heart:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And so thou gavest thy city over into the hands of thine enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Are their deeds then any better that inhabit Babylon, that they should therefore have the dominion over Sion?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For when I came thither, and had seen impieties without number, then my soul saw many evildoers in this thirtieth year, so that my heart failed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For I have seen how thou sufferest them sinning, and hast spared wicked doers: and hast destroyed thy people, and hast preserved thine enemies, and hast not signified it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I do not remember how this way may be left: Are they then of Babylon better than they of Sion?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Or is there any other people that knoweth thee beside Israel? or what generation hath so believed thy covenants as Jacob?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And yet their reward appeareth not, and their labour hath no fruit: for I have gone here and there through the heathen, and I see that they flow in wealth, and think not upon thy commandments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Weigh thou therefore our wickedness now in the balance, and their's also that dwell the world; and so shall thy name no where be found but in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Or when was it that they which dwell upon the earth have not sinned in thy sight? or what people have so kept thy commandments?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Thou shalt find that Israel by name hath kept thy precepts; but not the heathen.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the angel that was sent unto me, whose name was Uriel, gave me an answer,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And said, Thy heart hath gone to far in this world, and thinkest thou to comprehend the way of the most High?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said I, Yea, my lord. And he answered me, and said, I am sent to shew thee three ways, and to set forth three similitudes before thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Whereof if thou canst declare me one, I will shew thee also the way that thou desirest to see, and I shall shew thee from whence the wicked heart cometh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I said, Tell on, my lord. Then said he unto me, Go thy way, weigh me the weight of the fire, or measure me the blast of the wind, or call me again the day that is past.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then answered I and said, What man is able to do that, that thou shouldest ask such things of me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said unto me, If I should ask thee how great dwellings are in the midst of the sea, or how many springs are in the beginning of the deep, or how many springs are above the firmament, or which are the outgoings of paradise:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Peradventure thou wouldest say unto me, I never went down into the deep, nor as yet into hell, neither did I ever climb up into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nevertheless now have I asked thee but only of the fire and wind, and of the day wherethrough thou hast passed, and of things from which thou canst not be separated, and yet canst thou give me no answer of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said moreover unto me, Thine own things, and such as are grown up with thee, canst thou not know;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">How should thy vessel then be able to comprehend the way of the Highest, and, the world being now outwardly corrupted to understand the corruption that is evident in my sight?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said I unto him, It were better that we were not at all, than that we should live still in wickedness, and to suffer, and not to know wherefore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He answered me, and said, I went into a forest into a plain, and the trees took counsel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And said, Come, let us go and make war against the sea that it may depart away before us, and that we may make us more woods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The floods of the sea also in like manner took counsel, and said, Come, let us go up and subdue the woods of the plain, that there also we may make us another country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The thought of the wood was in vain, for the fire came and consumed it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The thought of the floods of the sea came likewise to nought, for the sand stood up and stopped them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If thou wert judge now betwixt these two, whom wouldest thou begin to justify? or whom wouldest thou condemn?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I answered and said, Verily it is a foolish thought that they both have devised, for the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea also hath his place to bear his floods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then answered he me, and said, Thou hast given a right judgment, but why judgest thou not thyself also?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For like as the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea to his floods: even so they that dwell upon the earth may understand nothing but that which is upon the earth: and he that dwelleth above the heavens may only understand the things that are above the height of the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then answered I and said, I beseech thee, O Lord, let me have understanding:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For it was not my mind to be curious of the high things, but of such as pass by us daily, namely, wherefore Israel is given up as a reproach to the heathen, and for what cause the people whom thou hast loved is given over unto ungodly nations, and why the law of our forefathers is brought to nought, and the written covenants come to none effect,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And we pass away out of the world as grasshoppers, and our life is astonishment and fear, and we are not worthy to obtain mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">What will he then do unto his name whereby we are called? of these things have I asked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then answered he me, and said, The more thou searchest, the more thou shalt marvel; for the world hasteth fast to pass away,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And cannot comprehend the things that are promised to the righteous in time to come: for this world is full of unrighteousness and infirmities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But as concerning the things whereof thou askest me, I will tell thee; for the evil is sown, but the destruction thereof is not yet come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">If therefore that which is sown be not turned upside down, and if the place where the evil is sown pass not away, then cannot it come that is sown with good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For the grain of evil seed hath been sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning, and how much ungodliness hath it brought up unto this time? and how much shall it yet bring forth until the time of threshing come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Ponder now by thyself, how great fruit of wickedness the grain of evil seed hath brought forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And when the ears shall be cut down, which are without number, how great a floor shall they fill?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then I answered and said, How, and when shall these things come to pass? wherefore are our years few and evil?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he answered me, saying, Do not thou hasten above the most Highest: for thy haste is in vain to be above him, for thou hast much exceeded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Did not the souls also of the righteous ask question of these things in their chambers, saying, How long shall I hope on this fashion? when cometh the fruit of the floor of our reward?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And unto these things Uriel the archangel gave them answer, and said, Even when the number of seeds is filled in you: for he hath weighed the world in the balance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">By measure hath he measured the times; and by number hath he numbered the times; and he doth not move nor stir them, until the said measure be fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, even we all are full of impiety.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And for our sakes peradventure it is that the floors of the righteous are not filled, because of the sins of them that dwell upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So he answered me, and said, Go thy way to a woman with child, and ask of her when she hath fulfilled her nine months, if her womb may keep the birth any longer within her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then said I, No, Lord, that can she not. And he said unto me, In the grave the chambers of souls are like the womb of a woman:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For like as a woman that travaileth maketh haste to escape the necessity of the travail: even so do these places haste to deliver those things that are committed unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">From the beginning, look, what thou desirest to see, it shall be shewed thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then answered I and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, and if it be possible, and if I be meet therefore,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Shew me then whether there be more to come than is past, or more past than is to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">What is past I know, but what is for to come I know not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And he said unto me, Stand up upon the right side, and I shall expound the similitude unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">So I stood, and saw, and, behold, an hot burning oven passed by before me: and it happened that when the flame was gone by I looked, and, behold, the smoke remained still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">After this there passed by before me a watery cloud, and sent down much rain with a storm; and when the stormy rain was past, the drops remained still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Then said he unto me, Consider with thyself; as the rain is more than the drops, and as the fire is greater than the smoke; but the drops and the smoke remain behind: so the quantity which is past did more exceed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Then I prayed, and said, May I live, thinkest thou, until that time? or what shall happen in those days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">He answered me, and said, As for the tokens whereof thou askest me, I may tell thee of them in part: but as touching thy life, I am not sent to shew thee; for I do not know it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Nevertheless as coming the tokens, behold, the days shall come, that they which dwell upon earth shall be taken in a great number, and the way of truth shall be hidden, and the land shall be barren of faith.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And the land, that thou seest now to have root, shalt thou see wasted suddenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But if the most High grant thee to live, thou shalt see after the third trumpet that the sun shall suddenly shine again in the night, and the moon thrice in the day:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And blood shall drop out of wood, and the stone shall give his voice, and the people shall be troubled:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And even he shall rule, whom they look not for that dwell upon the earth, and the fowls shall take their flight away together:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the Sodomitish sea shall cast out fish, and make a noise in the night, which many have not known: but they shall all hear the voice thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">There shall be a confusion also in many places, and the fire shall be oft sent out again, and the wild beasts shall change their places, and menstruous women shall bring forth monsters:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And salt waters shall be found in the sweet, and all friends shall destroy one another; then shall wit hide itself, and understanding withdraw itself into his secret chamber,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And shall be sought of many, and yet not be found: then shall unrighteousness and incontinency be multiplied upon earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">One land also shall ask another, and say, Is righteousness that maketh a man righteous gone through thee? And it shall say, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">At the same time shall men hope, but nothing obtain: they shall labour, but their ways shall not prosper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">To shew thee such tokens I have leave; and if thou wilt pray again, and weep as now, and fast even days, thou shalt hear yet greater things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then I awaked, and an extreme fearfulness went through all my body, and my mind was troubled, so that it fainted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the angel that was come to talk with me held me, comforted me, and set me up upon my feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And in the second night it came to pass, that Salathiel the captain of the people came unto me, saying, Where hast thou been? and why is thy countenance so heavy?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Knowest thou not that Israel is committed unto thee in the land of their captivity?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Up then, and eat bread, and forsake us not, as the shepherd that leaveth his flock in the hands of cruel wolves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then said I unto him, Go thy ways from me, and come not nigh me. And he heard what I said, and went from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And so I fasted seven days, mourning and weeping, like as Uriel the angel commanded me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And after seven days so it was, that the thoughts of my heart were very grievous unto me again,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And my soul recovered the spirit of understanding, and I began to talk with the most High again,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And said, O Lord that bearest rule, of every wood of the earth, and of all the trees thereof, thou hast chosen thee one only vine:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And of all lands of the whole world thou hast chosen thee one pit: and of all the flowers thereof one lily:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And of all the depths of the sea thou hast filled thee one river: and of all builded cities thou hast hallowed Sion unto thyself:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And of all the fowls that are created thou hast named thee one dove: and of all the cattle that are made thou hast provided thee one sheep:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And among all the multitudes of people thou hast gotten thee one people: and unto this people, whom thou lovedst, thou gavest a law that is approved of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And now, O Lord, why hast thou given this one people over unto many? and upon the one root hast thou prepared others, and why hast thou scattered thy only one people among many?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And they which did gainsay thy promises, and believed not thy covenants, have trodden them down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">If thou didst so much hate thy people, yet shouldest thou punish them with thine own hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now when I had spoken these words, the angel that came to me the night afore was sent unto me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And said unto me, Hear me, and I will instruct thee; hearken to the thing that I say, and I shall tell thee more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And I said, Speak on, my Lord. Then said he unto me, Thou art sore troubled in mind for Israel's sake: lovest thou that people better than he that made them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And I said, No, Lord: but of very grief have I spoken: for my reins pain me every hour, while I labour to comprehend the way of the most High, and to seek out part of his judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he said unto me, Thou canst not. And I said, Wherefore, Lord? whereunto was I born then? or why was not my mother's womb then my grave, that I might not have seen the travail of Jacob, and the wearisome toil of the stock of Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he said unto me, Number me the things that are not yet come, gather me together the dross that are scattered abroad, make me the flowers green again that are withered,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Open me the places that are closed, and bring me forth the winds that in them are shut up, shew me the image of a voice: and then I will declare to thee the thing that thou labourest to know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And I said, O Lord that bearest rule, who may know these things, but he that hath not his dwelling with men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">As for me, I am unwise: how may I then speak of these things whereof thou askest me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then said he unto me, Like as thou canst do none of these things that I have spoken of, even so canst thou not find out my judgment, or in the end the love that I have promised unto my people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And I said, Behold, O Lord, yet art thou nigh unto them that be reserved till the end: and what shall they do that have been before me, or we that be now, or they that shall come after us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he said unto me, I will liken my judgment unto a ring: like as there is no slackness of the last, even so there is no swiftness of the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">So I answered and said, Couldest thou not make those that have been made, and be now, and that are for to come, at once; that thou mightest shew thy judgment the sooner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then answered he me, and said, The creature may not haste above the maker; neither may the world hold them at once that shall be created therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And I said, As thou hast said unto thy servant, that thou, which givest life to all, hast given life at once to the creature that thou hast created, and the creature bare it: even so it might now also bear them that now be present at once.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And he said unto me, Ask the womb of a woman, and say unto her, If thou bringest forth children, why dost thou it not together, but one after another? pray her therefore to bring forth ten children at once.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And I said, She cannot: but must do it by distance of time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then said he unto me, Even so have I given the womb of the earth to those that be sown in it in their times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">For like as a young child may not bring forth the things that belong to the aged, even so have I disposed the world which I created.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And I asked, and said, Seeing thou hast now given me the way, I will proceed to speak before thee: for our mother, of whom thou hast told me that she is young, draweth now nigh unto age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He answered me, and said, Ask a woman that beareth children, and she shall tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Say unto her, Wherefore are unto they whom thou hast now brought forth like those that were before, but less of stature?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And she shall answer thee, They that be born in the the strength of youth are of one fashion, and they that are born in the time of age, when the womb faileth, are otherwise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Consider thou therefore also, how that ye are less of stature than those that were before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And so are they that come after you less than ye, as the creatures which now begin to be old, and have passed over the strength of youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Then said I, Lord, I beseech thee, if I have found favour in thy sight, shew thy servant by whom thou visitest thy creature.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he said unto me, In the beginning, when the earth was made, before the borders of the world stood, or ever the winds blew,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Before it thundered and lightened, or ever the foundations of paradise were laid,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Before the fair flowers were seen, or ever the moveable powers were established, before the innumerable multitude of angels were gathered together,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Or ever the heights of the air were lifted up, before the measures of the firmament were named, or ever the chimneys in Sion were hot,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And ere the present years were sought out, and or ever the inventions of them that now sin were turned, before they were sealed that have gathered faith for a treasure:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then did I consider these things, and they all were made through me alone, and through none other: by me also they shall be ended, and by none other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then answered I and said, What shall be the parting asunder of the times? or when shall be the end of the first, and the beginning of it that followeth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said unto me, From Abraham unto Isaac, when Jacob and Esau were born of him, Jacob's hand held first the heel of Esau.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For Esau is the end of the world, and Jacob is the beginning of it that followeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The hand of man is betwixt the heel and the hand: other question, Esdras, ask thou not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I answered then and said, O Lord that bearest rule, if I have found favour in thy sight,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I beseech thee, shew thy servant the end of thy tokens, whereof thou shewedst me part the last night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So he answered and said unto me, Stand up upon thy feet, and hear a mighty sounding voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And it shall be as it were a great motion; but the place where thou standest shall not be moved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And therefore when it speaketh be not afraid: for the word is of the end, and the foundation of the earth is understood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And why? because the speech of these things trembleth and is moved: for it knoweth that the end of these things must be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it happened, that when I had heard it I stood up upon my feet, and hearkened, and, behold, there was a voice that spake, and the sound of it was like the sound of many waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And it said, Behold, the days come, that I will begin to draw nigh, and to visit them that dwell upon the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And will begin to make inquisition of them, what they be that have hurt unjustly with their unrighteousness, and when the affliction of Sion shall be fulfilled;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the world, that shall begin to vanish away, shall be finished, then will I shew these tokens: the books shall be opened before the firmament, and they shall see all together:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the children of a year old shall speak with their voices, the women with child shall bring forth untimely children of three or four months old, and they shall live, and be raised up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And suddenly shall the sown places appear unsown, the full storehouses shall suddenly be found empty:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And tha trumpet shall give a sound, which when every man heareth, they shall be suddenly afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">At that time shall friends fight one against another like enemies, and the earth shall stand in fear with those that dwell therein, the springs of the fountains shall stand still, and in three hours they shall not run.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Whosoever remaineth from all these that I have told thee shall escape, and see my salvation, and the end of your world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the men that are received shall see it, who have not tasted death from their birth: and the heart of the inhabitants shall be changed, and turned into another meaning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For evil shall be put out, and deceit shall be quenched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">As for faith, it shall flourish, corruption shall be overcome, and the truth, which hath been so long without fruit, shall be declared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when he talked with me, behold, I looked by little and little upon him before whom I stood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And these words said he unto me; I am come to shew thee the time of the night to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">If thou wilt pray yet more, and fast seven days again, I shall tell thee greater things by day than I have heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For thy voice is heard before the most High: for the Mighty hath seen thy righteous dealing, he hath seen also thy chastity, which thou hast had ever since thy youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And therefore hath he sent me to shew thee all these things, and to say unto thee, Be of good comfort and fear not</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And hasten not with the times that are past, to think vain things, that thou mayest not hasten from the latter times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And it came to pass after this, that I wept again, and fasted seven days in like manner, that I might fulfil the three weeks which he told me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And in the eighth night was my heart vexed within me again, and I began to speak before the most High.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For my spirit was greatly set on fire, and my soul was in distress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And I said, O Lord, thou spakest from the beginning of the creation, even the first day, and saidst thus; Let heaven and earth be made; and thy word was a perfect work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And then was the spirit, and darkness and silence were on every side; the sound of man's voice was not yet formed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then commandedst thou a fair light to come forth of thy treasures, that thy work might appear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Upon the second day thou madest the spirit of the firmament, and commandedst it to part asunder, and to make a division betwixt the waters, that the one part might go up, and the other remain beneath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Upon the third day thou didst command that the waters should be gathered in the seventh part of the earth: six pats hast thou dried up, and kept them, to the intent that of these some being planted of God and tilled might serve thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">For as soon as thy word went forth the work was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For immediately there was great and innumerable fruit, and many and divers pleasures for the taste, and flowers of unchangeable colour, and odours of wonderful smell: and this was done the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Upon the fourth day thou commandedst that the sun should shine, and the moon give her light, and the stars should be in order:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And gavest them a charge to do service unto man, that was to be made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Upon the fifth day thou saidst unto the seventh part, where the waters were gathered that it should bring forth living creatures, fowls and fishes: and so it came to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">For the dumb water and without life brought forth living things at the commandment of God, that all people might praise thy wondrous works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Then didst thou ordain two living creatures, the one thou calledst Enoch, and the other Leviathan;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And didst separate the one from the other: for the seventh part, namely, where the water was gathered together, might not hold them both.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Unto Enoch thou gavest one part, which was dried up the third day, that he should dwell in the same part, wherein are a thousand hills:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">But unto Leviathan thou gavest the seventh part, namely, the moist; and hast kept him to be devoured of whom thou wilt, and when.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Upon the sixth day thou gavest commandment unto the earth, that before thee it should bring forth beasts, cattle, and creeping things:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And after these, Adam also, whom thou madest lord of all thy creatures: of him come we all, and the people also whom thou hast chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">All this have I spoken before thee, O Lord, because thou madest the world for our sakes</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">As for the other people, which also come of Adam, thou hast said that they are nothing, but be like unto spittle: and hast likened the abundance of them unto a drop that falleth from a vessel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And now, O Lord, behold, these heathen, which have ever been reputed as nothing, have begun to be lords over us, and to devour us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">But we thy people, whom thou hast called thy firstborn, thy only begotten, and thy fervent lover, are given into their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">If the world now be made for our sakes, why do we not possess an inheritance with the world? how long shall this endure?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when I had made an end of speaking these words, there was sent unto me the angel which had been sent unto me the nights afore:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said unto me, Up, Esdras, and hear the words that I am come to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I said, Speak on, my God. Then said he unto me, The sea is set in a wide place, that it might be deep and great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But put the case the entrance were narrow, and like a river;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Who then could go into the sea to look upon it, and to rule it? if he went not through the narrow, how could he come into the broad?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There is also another thing; A city is builded, and set upon a broad field, and is full of all good things:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The entrance thereof is narrow, and is set in a dangerous place to fall, like as if there were a fire on the right hand, and on the left a deep water:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And one only path between them both, even between the fire and the water, so small that there could but one man go there at once.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If this city now were given unto a man for an inheritance, if he never shall pass the danger set before it, how shall he receive this inheritance?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I said, It is so, Lord. Then said he unto me, Even so also is Israel's portion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Because for their sakes I made the world: and when Adam transgressed my statutes, then was decreed that now is done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then were the entrances of this world made narrow, full of sorrow and travail: they are but few and evil, full of perils,: and very painful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For the entrances of the elder world were wide and sure, and brought immortal fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If then they that live labour not to enter these strait and vain things, they can never receive those that are laid up for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore why disquietest thou thyself, seeing thou art but a corruptible man? and why art thou moved, whereas thou art but mortal?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Why hast thou not considered in thy mind this thing that is to come, rather than that which is present?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, thou hast ordained in thy law, that the righteous should inherit these things, but that the ungodly should perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Nevertheless the righteous shall suffer strait things, and hope for wide: for they that have done wickedly have suffered the strait things, and yet shall not see the wide.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said unto me. There is no judge above God, and none that hath understanding above the Highest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For there be many that perish in this life, because they despise the law of God that is set before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For God hath given strait commandment to such as came, what they should do to live, even as they came, and what they should observe to avoid punishment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Nevertheless they were not obedient unto him; but spake against him, and imagined vain things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And deceived themselves by their wicked deeds; and said of the most High, that he is not; and knew not his ways:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But his law have they despised, and denied his covenants; in his statutes have they not been faithful, and have not performed his works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And therefore, Esdras, for the empty are empty things, and for the full are the full things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Behold, the time shall come, that these tokens which I have told thee shall come to pass, and the bride shall appear, and she coming forth shall be seen, that now is withdrawn from the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And whosoever is delivered from the foresaid evils shall see my wonders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For my son Jesus shall be revealed with those that be with him, and they that remain shall rejoice within four hundred years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">After these years shall my son Christ die, and all men that have life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the world shall be turned into the old silence seven days, like as in the former judgments: so that no man shall remain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And after seven days the world, that yet awaketh not, shall be raised up, and that shall die that is corrupt</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the earth shall restore those that are asleep in her, and so shall the dust those that dwell in silence, and the secret places shall deliver those souls that were committed unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the most High shall appear upon the seat of judgment, and misery shall pass away, and the long suffering shall have an end:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But judgment only shall remain, truth shall stand, and faith shall wax strong:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the work shall follow, and the reward shall be shewed, and the good deeds shall be of force, and wicked deeds shall bear no rule.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then said I, Abraham prayed first for the Sodomites, and Moses for the fathers that sinned in the wilderness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Jesus after him for Israel in the time of Achan:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Samuel and David for the destruction: and Solomon for them that should come to the sanctuary:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Helias for those that received rain; and for the dead, that he might live:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Ezechias for the people in the time of Sennacherib: and many for many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Even so now, seeing corruption is grown up, and wickedness increased, and the righteous have prayed for the ungodly: wherefore shall it not be so now also?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He answered me, and said, This present life is not the end where much glory doth abide; therefore have they prayed for the weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the day of doom shall be the end of this time, and the beginning of the immortality for to come, wherein corruption is past,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Intemperance is at an end, infidelity is cut off, righteousness is grown, and truth is sprung up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then shall no man be able to save him that is destroyed, nor to oppress him that hath gotten the victory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">I answered then and said, This is my first and last saying, that it had been better not to have given the earth unto Adam: or else, when it was given him, to have restrained him from sinning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">For what profit is it for men now in this present time to live in heaviness, and after death to look for punishment?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">O thou Adam, what hast thou done? for though it was thou that sinned, thou art not fallen alone, but we all that come of thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">For what profit is it unto us, if there be promised us an immortal time, whereas we have done the works that bring death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And that there is promised us an everlasting hope, whereas ourselves being most wicked are made vain?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And that there are laid up for us dwellings of health and safety, whereas we have lived wickedly?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And that the glory of the most High is kept to defend them which have led a wary life, whereas we have walked in the most wicked ways of all?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And that there should be shewed a paradise, whose fruit endureth for ever, wherein is security and medicine, since we shall not enter into it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">(For we have walked in unpleasant places.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And that the faces of them which have used abstinence shall shine above the stars, whereas our faces shall be blacker than darkness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">For while we lived and committed iniquity, we considered not that we should begin to suffer for it after death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Then answered he me, and said, This is the condition of the battle, which man that is born upon the earth shall fight;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">That, if he be overcome, he shall suffer as thou hast said: but if he get the victory, he shall receive the thing that I say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">For this is the life whereof Moses spake unto the people while he lived, saying, Choose thee life, that thou mayest live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Nevertheless they believed not him, nor yet the prophets after him, no nor me which have spoken unto them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">That there should not be such heaviness in their destruction, as shall be joy over them that are persuaded to salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">I answered then, and said, I know, Lord, that the most High is called merciful, in that he hath mercy upon them which are not yet come into the world,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">And upon those also that turn to his law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">And that he is patient, and long suffereth those that have sinned, as his creatures;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And that he is bountiful, for he is ready to give where it needeth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">And that he is of great mercy, for he multiplieth more and more mercies to them that are present, and that are past, and also to them which are to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">For if he shall not multiply his mercies, the world would not continue with them that inherit therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">And he pardoneth; for if he did not so of his goodness, that they which have committed iniquities might be eased of them, the ten thousandth part of men should not remain living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">And being judge, if he should not forgive them that are cured with his word, and put out the multitude of contentions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">There should be very few left peradventure in an innumerable multitude.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he answered me, saying, The most High hath made this world for many, but the world to come for few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I will tell thee a similitude, Esdras; As when thou askest the earth, it shall say unto thee, that it giveth much mould whereof earthen vessels are made, but little dust that gold cometh of: even so is the course of this present world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">There be many created, but few shall be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So answered I and said, Swallow then down, O my soul, understanding, and devour wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For thou hast agreed to give ear, and art willing to prophesy: for thou hast no longer space than only to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">O Lord, if thou suffer not thy servant, that we may pray before thee, and thou give us seed unto our heart, and culture to our understanding, that there may come fruit of it; how shall each man live that is corrupt, who beareth the place of a man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For thou art alone, and we all one workmanship of thine hands, like as thou hast said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For when the body is fashioned now in the mother's womb, and thou givest it members, thy creature is preserved in fire and water, and nine months doth thy workmanship endure thy creature which is created in her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But that which keepeth and is kept shall both be preserved: and when the time cometh, the womb preserved delivereth up the things that grew in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For thou hast commanded out of the parts of the body, that is to say, out of the breasts, milk to be given, which is the fruit of the breasts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">That the thing which is fashioned may be nourished for a time, till thou disposest it to thy mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Thou broughtest it up with thy righteousness, and nurturedst it in thy law, and reformedst it with thy judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And thou shalt mortify it as thy creature, and quicken it as thy work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If therefore thou shalt destroy him which with so great labour was fashioned, it is an easy thing to be ordained by thy commandment, that the thing which was made might be preserved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore, Lord, I will speak; touching man in general, thou knowest best; but touching thy people, for whose sake I am sorry;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And for thine inheritance, for whose cause I mourn; and for Israel, for whom I am heavy; and for Jacob, for whose sake I am troubled;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore will I begin to pray before thee for myself and for them: for I see the falls of us that dwell in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But I have heard the swiftness of the judge which is to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore hear my voice, and understand my words, and I shall speak before thee. This is the beginning of the words of Esdras, before he was taken up: and I said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">O Lord, thou that dwellest in everlastingness which beholdest from above things in the heaven and in the air;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Whose throne is inestimable; whose glory may not be comprehended; before whom the hosts of angels stand with trembling,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Whose service is conversant in wind and fire; whose word is true, and sayings constant; whose commandment is strong, and ordinance fearful;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Whose look drieth up the depths, and indignation maketh the mountains to melt away; which the truth witnesseth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">O hear the prayer of thy servant, and give ear to the petition of thy creature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For while I live I will speak, and so long as I have understanding I will answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">O look not upon the sins of thy people; but on them which serve thee in truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Regard not the wicked inventions of the heathen, but the desire of those that keep thy testimonies in afflictions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Think not upon those that have walked feignedly before thee: but remember them, which according to thy will have known thy fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Let it not be thy will to destroy them which have lived like beasts; but to look upon them that have clearly taught thy law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Take thou no indignation at them which are deemed worse than beasts; but love them that always put their trust in thy righteousness and glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For we and our fathers do languish of such diseases: but because of us sinners thou shalt be called merciful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For if thou hast a desire to have mercy upon us, thou shalt be called merciful, to us namely, that have no works of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For the just, which have many good works laid up with thee, shall out of their own deeds receive reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For what is man, that thou shouldest take displeasure at him? or what is a corruptible generation, that thou shouldest be so bitter toward it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For in truth them is no man among them that be born, but he hath dealt wickedly; and among the faithful there is none which hath not done amiss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For in this, O Lord, thy righteousness and thy goodness shall be declared, if thou be merciful unto them which have not the confidence of good works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then answered he me, and said, Some things hast thou spoken aright, and according unto thy words it shall be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For indeed I will not think on the disposition of them which have sinned before death, before judgment, before destruction:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But I will rejoice over the disposition of the righteous, and I will remember also their pilgrimage, and the salvation, and the reward, that they shall have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Like as I have spoken now, so shall it come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">For as the husbandman soweth much seed upon the ground, and planteth many trees, and yet the thing that is sown good in his season cometh not up, neither doth all that is planted take root: even so is it of them that are sown in the world; they shall not all be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">I answered then and said, If I have found grace, let me speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Like as the husbandman's seed perisheth, if it come not up, and receive not thy rain in due season; or if there come too much rain, and corrupt it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Even so perisheth man also, which is formed with thy hands, and is called thine own image, because thou art like unto him, for whose sake thou hast made all things, and likened him unto the husbandman's seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Be not wroth with us but spare thy people, and have mercy upon thine own inheritance: for thou art merciful unto thy creature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then answered he me, and said, Things present are for the present, and things to cometh for such as be to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">For thou comest far short that thou shouldest be able to love my creature more than I: but I have ofttimes drawn nigh unto thee, and unto it, but never to the unrighteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">In this also thou art marvellous before the most High:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">In that thou hast humbled thyself, as it becometh thee, and hast not judged thyself worthy to be much glorified among the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">For many great miseries shall be done to them that in the latter time shall dwell in the world, because they have walked in great pride.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">But understand thou for thyself, and seek out the glory for such as be like thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">For unto you is paradise opened, the tree of life is planted, the time to come is prepared, plenteousness is made ready, a city is builded, and rest is allowed, yea, perfect goodness and wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">The root of evil is sealed up from you, weakness and the moth is hid from you, and corruption is fled into hell to be forgotten:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Sorrows are passed, and in the end is shewed the treasure of immortality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And therefore ask thou no more questions concerning the multitude of them that perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">For when they had taken liberty, they despised the most High, thought scorn of his law, and forsook his ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Moreover they have trodden down his righteous,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And said in their heart, that there is no God; yea, and that knowing they must die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">For as the things aforesaid shalt receive you, so thirst and pain are prepared for them: for it was not his will that men should come to nought:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">But they which be created have defiled the name of him that made them, and were unthankful unto him which prepared life for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And therefore is my judgment now at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">These things have I not shewed unto all men, but unto thee, and a few like thee. Then answered I and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Behold, O Lord, now hast thou shewed me the multitude of the wonders, which thou wilt begin to do in the last times: but at what time, thou hast not shewed me.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">He answered me then, and said, Measure thou the time diligently in itself: and when thou seest part of the signs past, which I have told thee before,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then shalt thou understand, that it is the very same time, wherein the Highest will begin to visit the world which he made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore when there shall be seen earthquakes and uproars of the people in the world:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then shalt thou well understand, that the most High spake of those things from the days that were before thee, even from the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For like as all that is made in the world hath a beginning and an end, and the end is manifest:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Even so the times also of the Highest have plain beginnings in wonder and powerful works, and endings in effects and signs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And every one that shall be saved, and shall be able to escape by his works, and by faith, whereby ye have believed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Shall be preserved from the said perils, and shall see my salvation in my land, and within my borders: for I have sanctified them for me from the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then shall they be in pitiful case, which now have abused my ways: and they that have cast them away despitefully shall dwell in torments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For such as in their life have received benefits, and have not known me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they that have loathed my law, while they had yet liberty, and, when as yet place of repentance was open unto them, understood not, but despised it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The same must know it after death by pain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And therefore be thou not curious how the ungodly shall be punished, and when: but enquire how the righteous shall be saved, whose the world is, and for whom the world is created.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then answered I and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I have said before, and now do speak, and will speak it also hereafter, that there be many more of them which perish, than of them which shall be saved:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Like as a wave is greater than a drop.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he answered me, saying, Like as the field is, so is also the seed; as the flowers be, such are the colours also; such as the workman is, such also is the work; and as the husbandman ls himself, so is his husbandry also: for it was the time of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And now when I prepared the world, which was not yet made, even for them to dwell in that now live, no man spake against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For then every one obeyed: but now the manners of them which are created in this world that is made are corrupted by a perpetual seed, and by a law which is unsearchable rid themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So I considered the world, and, behold, there was peril because of the devices that were come into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And I saw, and spared it greatly, and have kept me a grape of the cluster, and a plant of a great people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Let the multitude perish then, which was born in vain; and let my grape be kept, and my plant; for with great labour have I made it perfect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Nevertheless, if thou wilt cease yet seven days more, (but thou shalt not fast in them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But go into a field of flowers, where no house is builded, and eat only the flowers of the field; taste no flesh, drink no wine, but eat flowers only;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And pray unto the Highest continually, then will I come and talk with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So I went my way into the field which is called Ardath, like as he commanded me; and there I sat among the flowers, and did eat of the herbs of the field, and the meat of the same satisfied me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">After seven days I sat upon the grass, and my heart was vexed within me, like as before:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And I opened my mouth, and began to talk before the most High, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">O Lord, thou that shewest thyself unto us, thou wast shewed unto our fathers in the wilderness, in a place where no man treadeth, in a barren place, when they came out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And thou spakest saying, Hear me, O Israel; and mark my words, thou seed of Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For, behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring fruit in you, and ye shall be honoured in it for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But our fathers, which received the law, kept it not, and observed not thy ordinances: and though the fruit of thy law did not perish, neither could it, for it was thine;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Yet they that received it perished, because they kept not the thing that was sown in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And, lo, it ls a custom, when the ground hath received seed, or the sea a ship, or any vessel meat or drink, that, that being perished wherein it was sown or cast into,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">That thing also which was sown, or cast therein, or received, doth perish, and remaineth not with us: but with us it hath not happened so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For we that have received the law perish by sin, and our heart also which received it</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Notwithstanding the law perisheth not, but remaineth in his force.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And when I spake these things in my heart, I looked back with mine eyes, and upon the right side I saw a woman, and, behold, she mourned and wept with a loud voice, and was much grieved in heart, and her clothes were rent, and she had ashes upon her head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then let I my thoughts go that I was in, and turned me unto her,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And said unto her, Wherefore weepest thou? why art thou so grieved in thy mind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And she said unto me, Sir, let me alone, that I may bewail myself, and add unto my sorrow, for I am sore vexed in my mind, and brought very low.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And I said unto her, What aileth thee? tell me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">She said unto me, I thy servant have been barren, and had no child, though I had an husband thirty years,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And those thirty years I did nothing else day and night, and every hour, but make my, prayer to the Highest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">After thirty years God heard me thine handmaid, looked upon my misery, considered my trouble, and gave me a son: and I was very glad of him, so was my husband also, and all my neighbours: and we gave great honour unto the Almighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And I nourished him with great travail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">So when he grew up, and came to the time that he should have a wife, I made a feast.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it so came to pass, that when my son was entered into his wedding chamber, he fell down, and died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then we all overthrew the lights, and all my neighbours rose up to comfort me: so I took my rest unto the second day at night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And it came to pass, when they had all left off to comfort me, to the end I might be quiet; then rose I up by night and fled, and came hither into this field, as thou seest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I do now purpose not to return into the city, but here to stay, and neither to eat nor drink, but continually to mourn and to fast until I die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then left I the meditations wherein I was, and spake to her in anger, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Thou foolish woman above all other, seest thou not our mourning, and what happeneth unto us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">How that Sion our mother is full of all heaviness, and much humbled, mourning very sore?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And now, seeing we all mourn and are sad, for we are all in heaviness, art thou grieved for one son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For ask the earth, and she shall tell thee, that it is she which ought to mourn for the fall of so many that grow upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For out of her came all at the first, and out of her shall all others come, and, behold, they walk almost all into destruction, and a multitude of them is utterly rooted out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Who then should make more mourning than she, that hath lost so great a multitude; and not thou, which art sorry but for one?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But if thou sayest unto me, My lamentation is not like the earth's, because I have lost the fruit of my womb, which I brought forth with pains, and bare with sorrows;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the earth not so: for the multitude present in it according to the course of the earth is gone, as it came:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then say I unto thee, Like as thou hast brought forth with labour; even so the earth also hath given her fruit, namely, man, ever since the beginning unto him that made her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore keep thy sorrow to thyself, and bear with a good courage that which hath befallen thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For if thou shalt acknowledge the determination of God to be just, thou shalt both receive thy son in time, and shalt be commended among women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Go thy way then into the city to thine husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And she said unto me, That will I not do: I will not go into the city, but here will I die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So I proceeded to speak further unto her, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Do not so, but be counselled. by me: for how many are the adversities of Sion? be comforted in regard of the sorrow of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For thou seest that our sanctuary is laid waste, our altar broken down, our temple destroyed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Our psaltery is laid on the ground, our song is put to silence, our rejoicing is at an end, the light of our candlestick is put out, the ark of our covenant is spoiled, our holy things are defiled, and the name that is called upon us is almost profaned: our children are put to shame, our priests are burnt, our Levites are gone into captivity, our virgins are defiled, and our wives ravished; our righteous men carried away, our little ones destroyed, our young men are brought in bondage, and our strong men are become weak;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And, which is the greatest of all, the seal of Sion hath now lost her honour; for she is delivered into the hands of them that hate us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And therefore shake off thy great heaviness, and put away the multitude of sorrows, that the Mighty may be merciful unto thee again, and the Highest shall give thee rest and ease from thy labour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And it came to pass while I was talking with her, behold, her face upon a sudden shined exceedingly, and her countenance glistered, so that I was afraid of her, and mused what it might be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And, behold, suddenly she made a great cry very fearful: so that the earth shook at the noise of the woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And I looked, and, behold, the woman appeared unto me no more, but there was a city builded, and a large place shewed itself from the foundations: then was I afraid, and cried with a loud voice, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Where is Uriel the angel, who came unto me at the first? for he hath caused me to fall into many trances, and mine end is turned into corruption, and my prayer to rebuke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And as I was speaking these words behold, he came unto me, and looked upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And, lo, I lay as one that had been dead, and mine understanding was taken from me: and he took me by the right hand, and comforted me, and set me upon my feet, and said unto me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">What aileth thee? and why art thou so disquieted? and why is thine understanding troubled, and the thoughts of thine heart?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And I said, Because thou hast forsaken me, and yet I did according to thy words, and I went into the field, and, lo, I have seen, and yet see, that I am not able to express.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he said unto me, Stand up manfully, and I will advise thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then said I, Speak on, my lord, in me; only forsake me not, lest I die frustrate of my hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For I have seen that I knew not, and hear that I do not know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Or is my sense deceived, or my soul in a dream?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now therefore I beseech thee that thou wilt shew thy servant of this vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He answered me then, and said, Hear me, and I shall inform thee, and tell thee wherefore thou art afraid: for the Highest will reveal many secret things unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He hath seen that thy way is right: for that thou sorrowest continually for thy people, and makest great lamentation for Sion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">This therefore is the meaning of the vision which thou lately sawest:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Thou sawest a woman mourning, and thou begannest to comfort her:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But now seest thou the likeness of the woman no more, but there appeared unto thee a city builded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And whereas she told thee of the death of her son, this is the solution:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">This woman, whom thou sawest is Sion: and whereas she said unto thee, even she whom thou seest as a city builded,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Whereas, I say, she said unto thee, that she hath been thirty years barren: those are the thirty years wherein there was no offering made in her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But after thirty years Solomon builded the city and offered offerings: and then bare the barren a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And whereas she told thee that she nourished him with labour: that was the dwelling in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">But whereas she said unto thee, That my son coming into his marriage chamber happened to have a fail, and died: this was the destruction that came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And, behold, thou sawest her likeness, and because she mourned for her son, thou begannest to comfort her: and of these things which have chanced, these are to be opened unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">For now the most High seeth that thou art grieved unfeignedly, and sufferest from thy whole heart for her, so hath he shewed thee the brightness of her glory, and the comeliness of her beauty:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And therefore I bade thee remain in the field where no house was builded:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">For I knew that the Highest would shew this unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Therefore I commanded thee to go into the field, where no foundation of any building was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">For in the place wherein the Highest beginneth to shew his city, there can no man's building be able to stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And therefore fear not, let not thine heart be affrighted, but go thy way in, and see the beauty and greatness of the building, as much as thine eyes be able to see:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And then shalt thou hear as much as thine ears may comprehend.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">For thou art blessed above many other, and art called with the Highest; and so are but few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">But to morrow at night thou shalt remain here;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And so shall the Highest shew thee visions of the high things, which the most High will do unto them that dwell upon the earth in the last days. So I slept that night and another, like as he commanded me.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then saw I a dream, and, behold, there came up from the sea an eagle, which had twelve feathered wings, and three heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I saw, and, behold, she spread her wings over all the earth, and all the winds of the air blew on her, and were gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I beheld, and out of her feathers there grew other contrary feathers; and they became little feathers and small.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But her heads were at rest: the head in the midst was greater than the other, yet rested it with the residue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover I beheld, and, lo, the eagle flew with her feathers, and reigned upon earth, and over them that dwelt therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I saw that all things under heaven were subject unto her, and no man spake against her, no, not one creature upon earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I beheld, and, lo, the eagle rose upon her talons, and spake to her feathers, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Watch not all at once: sleep every one in his own place, and watch by course:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But let the heads be preserved for the last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I beheld, and, lo, the voice went not out of her heads, but from the midst of her body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I numbered her contrary feathers, and, behold, there were eight of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I looked, and, behold, on the right side there arose one feather, and reigned over all the earth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And so it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, and the place thereof appeared no more: so the next following stood up. and reigned, and had a great time;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And it happened, that when it reigned, the end of it came also, like as the first, so that it appeared no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then came there a voice unto it, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Hear thou that hast borne rule over the earth so long: this I say unto thee, before thou beginnest to appear no more,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">There shall none after thee attain unto thy time, neither unto the half thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then arose the third, and reigned as the other before, and appeared no more also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So went it with all the residue one after another, as that every one reigned, and then appeared no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then I beheld, and, lo, in process of time the feathers that followed stood up upon the right side, that they might rule also; and some of them ruled, but within a while they appeared no more:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For some of them were set up, but ruled not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After this I looked, and, behold, the twelve feathers appeared no more, nor the two little feathers:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there was no more upon the eagle's body, but three heads that rested, and six little wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then saw I also that two little feathers divided themselves from the six, and remained under the head that was upon the right side: for the four continued in their place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And I beheld, and, lo, the feathers that were under the wing thought to set up themselves and to have the rule.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And I beheld, and, lo, there was one set up, but shortly it appeared no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the second was sooner away than the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And I beheld, and, lo, the two that remained thought also in themselves to reign:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when they so thought, behold, there awaked one of the heads that were at rest, namely, it that was in the midst; for that was greater than the two other heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And then I saw that the two other heads were joined with it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And, behold, the head was turned with them that were with it, and did eat up the two feathers under the wing that would have reigned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But this head put the whole earth in fear, and bare rule in it over all those that dwelt upon the earth with much oppression; and it had the governance of the world more than all the wings that had been.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And after this I beheld, and, lo, the head that was in the midst suddenly appeared no more, like as the wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But there remained the two heads, which also in like sort ruled upon the earth, and over those that dwelt therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And I beheld, and, lo, the head upon the right side devoured it that was upon the left side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then I head a voice, which said unto me, Look before thee, and consider the thing that thou seest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And I beheld, and lo, as it were a roaring lion chased out of the wood: and I saw that he sent out a man's voice unto the eagle, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Hear thou, I will talk with thee, and the Highest shall say unto thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Art not thou it that remainest of the four beasts, whom I made to reign in my world, that the end of their times might come through them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And the fourth came, and overcame all the beasts that were past, and had power over the world with great fearfulness, and over the whole compass of the earth with much wicked oppression; and so long time dwelt he upon the earth with deceit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">For the earth hast thou not judged with truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For thou hast afflicted the meek, thou hast hurt the peaceable, thou hast loved liars, and destroyed the dwellings of them that brought forth fruit, and hast cast down the walls of such as did thee no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Therefore is thy wrongful dealing come up unto the Highest, and thy pride unto the Mighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The Highest also hath looked upon the proud times, and, behold, they are ended, and his abominations are fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And therefore appear no more, thou eagle, nor thy horrible wings, nor thy wicked feathers nor thy malicious heads, nor thy hurtful claws, nor all thy vain body:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">That all the earth may be refreshed, and may return, being delivered from thy violence, and that she may hope for the judgment and mercy of him that made her.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, whiles the lion spake these words unto the eagle, I saw,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And, behold, the head that remained and the four wings appeared no more, and the two went unto it and set themselves up to reign, and their kingdom was small, and fill of uproar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I saw, and, behold, they appeared no more, and the whole body of the eagle was burnt so that the earth was in great fear: then awaked I out of the trouble and trance of my mind, and from great fear, and said unto my spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Lo, this hast thou done unto me, in that thou searchest out the ways of the Highest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Lo, yet am I weary in my mind, and very weak in my spirit; and little strength is there in me, for the great fear wherewith I was afflicted this night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore will I now beseech the Highest, that he will comfort me unto the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I said, Lord that bearest rule, if I have found grace before thy sight, and if I am justified with thee before many others, and if my prayer indeed be come up before thy face;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Comfort me then, and shew me thy servant the interpretation and plain difference of this fearful vision, that thou mayest perfectly comfort my soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For thou hast judged me worthy to shew me the last times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said unto me, This is the interpretation of the vision:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The eagle, whom thou sawest come up from the sea, is the kingdom which was seen in the vision of thy brother Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But it was not expounded unto him, therefore now I declare it unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Behold, the days will come, that there shall rise up a kingdom upon earth, and it shall be feared above all the kingdoms that were before it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the same shall twelve kings reign, one after another:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Whereof the second shall begin to reign, and shall have more time than any of the twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And this do the twelve wings signify, which thou sawest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">As for the voice which thou heardest speak, and that thou sawest not to go out from the heads but from the midst of the body thereof, this is the interpretation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">That after the time of that kingdom there shall arise great strivings, and it shall stand in peril of failing: nevertheless it shall not then fall, but shall be restored again to his beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And whereas thou sawest the eight small under feathers sticking to her wings, this is the interpretation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">That in him there shall arise eight kings, whose times shall be but small, and their years swift.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And two of them shall perish, the middle time approaching: four shall be kept until their end begin to approach: but two shall be kept unto the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And whereas thou sawest three heads resting, this is the interpretation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In his last days shall the most High raise up three kingdoms, and renew many things therein, and they shall have the dominion of the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And of those that dwell therein, with much oppression, above all those that were before them: therefore are they called the heads of the eagle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For these are they that shall accomplish his wickedness, and that shall finish his last end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And whereas thou sawest that the great head appeared no more, it signifieth that one of them shall die upon his bed, and yet with pain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the two that remain shall be slain with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the sword of the one shall devour the other: but at the last shall he fall through the sword himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And whereas thou sawest two feathers under the wings passing over the head that is on the right side;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">It signifieth that these are they, whom the Highest hath kept unto their end: this is the small kingdom and full of trouble, as thou sawest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the lion, whom thou sawest rising up out of the wood, and roaring, and speaking to the eagle, and rebuking her for her unrighteousness with all the words which thou hast heard;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This is the anointed, which the Highest hath kept for them and for their wickedness unto the end: he shall reprove them, and shall upbraid them with their cruelty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For he shall set them before him alive in judgment, and shall rebuke them, and correct them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For the rest of my people shall he deliver with mercy, those that have been pressed upon my borders, and he shall make them joyful until the coming of the day of judgment, whereof I have spoken unto thee from the the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">This is the dream that thou sawest, and these are the interpretations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Thou only hast been meet to know this secret of the Highest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Therefore write all these things that thou hast seen in a book, and hide them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And teach them to the wise of the people, whose hearts thou knowest may comprehend and keep these secrets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But wait thou here thyself yet seven days more, that it may be shewed thee, whatsoever it pleaseth the Highest to declare unto thee. And with that he went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And it came to pass, when all the people saw that the seven days were past, and I not come again into the city, they gathered them all together, from the least unto the greatest, and came unto me, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">What have we offended thee? and what evil have we done against thee, that thou forsakest us, and sittest here in this place?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For of all the prophets thou only art left us, as a cluster of the vintage, and as a candle in a dark place, and as a haven or ship preserved from the tempest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Are not the evils which are come to us sufficient?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">If thou shalt forsake us, how much better had it been for us, if we also had been burned in the midst of Sion?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">For we are not better than they that died there. And they wept with a loud voice. Then answered I them, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Be of good comfort, O Israel; and be not heavy, thou house of Jacob:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">For the Highest hath you in remembrance, and the Mighty hath not forgotten you in temptation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">As for me, I have not forsaken you, neither am I departed from you: but am come into this place, to pray for the desolation of Sion, and that I might seek mercy for the low estate of your sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And now go your way home every man, and after these days will I come unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">So the people went their way into the city, like as I commanded them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">But I remained still in the field seven days, as the angel commanded me; and did eat only in those days of the flowers of the field, and had my meat of the herbs</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass after seven days, I dreamed a dream by night:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And, lo, there arose a wind from the sea, that it moved all the waves thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I beheld, and, lo, that man waxed strong with the thousands of heaven: and when he turned his countenance to look, all the things trembled that were seen under him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And whensoever the voice went out of his mouth, all they burned that heard his voice, like as the earth faileth when it feeleth the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And after this I beheld, and, lo, there was gathered together a multitude of men, out of number, from the four winds of the heaven, to subdue the man that came out of the sea</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I beheld, and, lo, he had graved himself a great mountain, and flew up upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But I would have seen the region or place whereout the hill was graven, and I could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And after this I beheld, and, lo, all they which were gathered together to subdue him were sore afraid, and yet durst fight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And, lo, as he saw the violence of the multitude that came, he neither lifted up his hand, nor held sword, nor any instrument of war:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But only I saw that he sent out of his mouth as it had been a blast of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out of his tongue he cast out sparks and tempests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they were all mixed together; the blast of fire, the flaming breath, and the great tempest; and fell with violence upon the multitude which was prepared to fight, and burned them up every one, so that upon a sudden of an innumerable multitude nothing was to be perceived, but only dust and smell of smoke: when I saw this I was afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Afterward saw I the same man come down from the mountain, and call unto him another peaceable Multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there came much people unto him, whereof some were glad, some were sorry, and some of them were bound, and other some brought of them that were offered: then was I sick through great fear, and I awaked, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Thou hast shewed thy servant these wonders from the beginning, and hast counted me worthy that thou shouldest receive my prayer:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Shew me now yet the interpretation of this dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For as I conceive in mine understanding, woe unto them that shall be left in those days and much more woe unto them that are not left behind!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For they that were not left were in heaviness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now understand I the things that are laid up in the latter days, which shall happen unto them, and to those that are left behind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore are they come into great perils and many necessities, like as these dreams declare.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yet is it easier for him that is in danger to come into these things, than to pass away as a cloud out of the world, and not to see the things that happen in the last days. And he answered unto me, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The interpretation of the vision shall I shew thee, and I will open unto thee the thing that thou hast required.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Whereas thou hast spoken of them that are left behind, this is the interpretation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He that shall endure the peril in that time hath kept himself: they that be fallen into danger are such as have works, and faith toward the Almighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Know this therefore, that they which be left behind are more blessed than they that be dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This is the meaning of the vision: Whereas thou sawest a man coming up from the midst of the sea:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The same is he whom God the Highest hath kept a great season, which by his own self shall deliver his creature: and he shall order them that are left behind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And whereas thou sawest, that out of his mouth there came as a blast of wind, and fire, and storm;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And that he held neither sword, nor any instrument of war, but that the rushing in of him destroyed the whole multitude that came to subdue him; this is the interpretation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Behold, the days come, when the most High will begin to deliver them that are upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he shall come to the astonishment of them that dwell on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And one shall undertake to fight against another, one city against another, one place against another, one people against another, and one realm against another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the time shall be when these things shall come to pass, and the signs shall happen which I shewed thee before, and then shall my Son be declared, whom thou sawest as a man ascending.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when all the people hear his voice, every man shall in their own land leave the battle they have one against another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, as thou sawest them, willing to come, and to overcome him by fighting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Sion shall come, and shall be shewed to all men, being prepared and builded, like as thou sawest the hill graven without hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And this my Son shall rebuke the wicked inventions of those nations, which for their wicked life are fallen into the tempest;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And shall lay before them their evil thoughts, and the torments wherewith they shall begin to be tormented, which are like unto a flame: and he shall destroy them without labour by the law which is like unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceable multitude unto him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters, and so came they into another land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But they took this counsel among themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a further country, where never mankind dwelt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">That they might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow places of the river.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For the most High then shewed signs for them, and held still the flood, till they were passed over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">For through that country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half: and the same region is called Arsareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then dwelt they there until the latter time; and now when they shall begin to come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The Highest shall stay the springs of the stream again, that they may go through: therefore sawest thou the multitude with peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">But those that be left behind of thy people are they that are found within my borders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Now when he destroyeth the multitude of the nations that are gathered together, he shall defend his people that remain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And then shall he shew them great wonders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Then said I, O Lord that bearest rule, shew me this: Wherefore have I seen the man coming up from the midst of the sea?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And he said unto me, Like as thou canst neither seek out nor know the things that are in the deep of the sea: even so can no man upon earth see my Son, or those that be with him, but in the day time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">This is the interpretation of the dream which thou sawest, and whereby thou only art here lightened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">For thou hast forsaken thine own way, and applied thy diligence unto my law, and sought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Thy life hast thou ordered in wisdom, and hast called understanding thy mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And therefore have I shewed thee the treasures of the Highest: after other three days I will speak other things unto thee, and declare unto thee mighty and wondrous things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Then went I forth into the field, giving praise and thanks greatly unto the most High because of his wonders which he did in time;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And because he governeth the same, and such things as fall in their seasons: and there I sat three days.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass upon the third day, I sat under an oak, and, behold, there came a voice out of a bush over against me, and said, Esdras, Esdras.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I said, Here am I, Lord And I stood up upon my feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said he unto me, In the bush I did manifestly reveal myself unto Moses, and talked with him, when my people served in Egypt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I sent him and led my people out of Egypt, and brought him up to the mount of where I held him by me a long season,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And told him many wondrous things, and shewed him the secrets of the times, and the end; and commanded him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These words shalt thou declare, and these shalt thou hide.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And now I say unto thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That thou lay up in thy heart the signs that I have shewed, and the dreams that thou hast seen, and the interpretations which thou hast heard:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For thou shalt be taken away from all, and from henceforth thou shalt remain with my Son, and with such as be like thee, until the times be ended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the world hath lost his youth, and the times begin to wax old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the world is divided into twelve parts, and the ten parts of it are gone already, and half of a tenth part:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And there remaineth that which is after the half of the tenth part.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now therefore set thine house in order, and reprove thy people, comfort such of them as be in trouble, and now renounce corruption,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let go from thee mortal thoughts, cast away the burdens of man, put off now the weak nature,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And set aside the thoughts that are most heavy unto thee, and haste thee to flee from these times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For yet greater evils than those which thou hast seen happen shall be done hereafter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For look how much the world shall be weaker through age, so much the more shall evils increase upon them that dwell therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the time is fled far away, and leasing is hard at hand: for now hasteth the vision to come, which thou hast seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then answered I before thee, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Behold, Lord, I will go, as thou hast commanded me, and reprove the people which are present: but they that shall be born afterward, who shall admonish them? thus the world is set in darkness, and they that dwell therein are without light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For thy law is burnt, therefore no man knoweth the things that are done of thee, or the work that shall begin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But if I have found grace before thee, send the Holy Ghost into me, and I shall write all that hath been done in the world since the beginning, which were written in thy law, that men may find thy path, and that they which will live in the latter days may live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he answered me, saying, Go thy way, gather the people together, and say unto them, that they seek thee not for forty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But look thou prepare thee many box trees, and take with thee Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ecanus, and Asiel, these five which are ready to write swiftly;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And come hither, and I shall light a candle of understanding in thine heart, which shall not be put out, till the things be performed which thou shalt begin to write.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when thou hast done, some things shalt thou publish, and some things shalt thou shew secretly to the wise: to morrow this hour shalt thou begin to write.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then went I forth, as he commanded, and gathered all the people together, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Hear these words, O Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Our fathers at the beginning were strangers in Egypt, from whence they were delivered:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And received the law of life, which they kept not, which ye also have transgressed after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then was the land, even the land of Sion, parted among you by lot: but your fathers, and ye yourselves, have done unrighteousness, and have not kept the ways which the Highest commanded you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And forasmuch as he is a righteous judge, he took from you in time the thing that he had given you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="46">While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="48">But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, Bring them hither to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">This is the first and great commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The Son of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And sitting down they watched him there;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And all the city was gathered together at the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="51">And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctines the commandments of men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For with God nothing shall be impossible.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="42">And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="50">And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="47">Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But wisdom is justified of all her children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="48">And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they did so, and made them all sit down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Last of all the woman died also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counseller; and he was a good man, and a just:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they remembered his words,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he took it, and did eat before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And ye are witnesses of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="43">Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="49">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="44">Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="51">And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">This he said, signifying what death he should die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then saith he to Thomas, reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, and hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But God raised him from the dead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="42">And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there they preached the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And there they abode long time with the disciples.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Paul departed from among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he drave them from the judgment seat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And all the men were about twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">These going before tarried for us at Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he wrote a letter after this manner:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appiiforum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Their feet are swift to shed blood:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Destruction and misery are in their ways:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the way of peace have they not known:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For he that is dead is freed from sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But if any man love God, the same is known of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="50">Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they glorified God in me.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For every man shall bear his own burden.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And this will we do, if God permit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And having an high priest over the house of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Use hospitality one to another without grudging.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:</VERS>
