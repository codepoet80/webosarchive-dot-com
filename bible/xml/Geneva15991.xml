    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning God created the heauen and the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the earth was without forme and void, and darkenesse was vpon the deepe, and the Spirit of God mooued vpon the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then God said, Let there be light: And there was light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And God saw the light that it was good, and God separated the light from the darkenes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And God called the Light, Day, and the darkenes, he called Night. So the euening and the morning were the first day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Againe God said, Let there be a firmament in the mids of the waters: and let it separate the waters from the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then God made the firmament, and separated the waters, which were vnder the firmament, from the waters which were aboue the firmament: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God called the firmament Heauen. So the Euening and the morning were the second day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God said againe, Let the waters vnder the heauen be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appeare. and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And God called the dry land, Earth, and he called the gathering together of the waters, Seas: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then God said, Let the earth bud forth the bud of the herbe, that seedeth seed, the fruitfull tree, which beareth fruite according to his kinde, which hath his seede in it selfe vpon the earth: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the earth brought foorth the bud of the herbe, that seedeth seede according to his kind, also the tree that beareth fruit, which hath his seed in it selfe according to his kinde: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So the euening and the morning were the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heauen, to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signes, and for seasons, and for dayes and yeeres.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heauen to giue light vpon the earth: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">God then made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesse light to rule the night: he made also the starres.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And God set them in the firmament of the heauen, to shine vpon the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to rule in the day, and in the night, and to separate the light from the darkenesse: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So the euening and the morning were the fourth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Afterward God said, Let the waters bring foorth in abundance euery creeping thing that hath life: and let the foule flie vpon the earth in the open firmament of the heauen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then God created the great whales, and euery thing liuing and mouing, which the waters brought foorth in abundance according to their kinde, and euery fethered foule according to his kinde: and God sawe that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then God blessed them, saying, Bring foorth fruite and multiplie, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the foule multiplie in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So the euening and the morning were the fifte day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Moreouer God said, Let the earth bring foorth the liuing thing according to his kinde, cattel, and that which creepeth, and the beast of the earth, according to his kinde. and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And God made the beast of the earth according to his kinde, and the cattell according to his kinde, and euery creeping thing of the earth according to his kind: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Furthermore God said, Let vs make man in our image according to our likenes, and let them rule ouer the fish of the sea, and ouer the foule of the heauen, and ouer the beastes, and ouer all the earth, and ouer euery thing that creepeth and moueth on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Thus God created the man in his image: in the image of God created he him: he created them male and female.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And God blessed them, and God said to them, Bring forth fruite and multiplie, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule ouer the fish of the sea, and ouer the foule of the heauen, and ouer euery beast that moueth vpon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And God said, Beholde, I haue giuen vnto you euery herbe bearing seede, which is vpon al the earth, and euery tree, wherein is the fruite of a tree bearing seede: that shall be to you for meate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Likewise to euery beast of the earth, and to euery foule of the heauen, and to euery thing that moueth vpon the earth, which hath life in it selfe, euery greene herbe shall be for meate. and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And God sawe all that he had made, and loe, it was very good. So the euening and the morning were the sixt day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Thus the heauens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For in the seuenth day GOD ended his worke which he had made, and the seuenth day he rested from al his worke, which he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So God blessed the seuenth day, and sanctified it, because that in it he had rested from all his worke, which God had created and made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These are the generations of the heauens and of the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heauens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And euery plant of the fielde, before it was in the earth, and euery herbe of the field, before it grewe: for the Lord God had not caused it to raine vpon the earth, neither was there a man to till the ground,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But a myst went vp from the earth, and watered all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Lord God also made the man of the dust of the grounde, and breathed in his face breath of life, and the man was a liuing soule.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">(For out of the ground made the Lord God to grow euery tree pleasant to the sight, and good for meate: the tree of life also in the mids of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and of euill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And out of Eden went a riuer to water the garden, and from thence it was deuided, and became into foure heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of one is Pishon: the same compasseth the whole land of Hauilah, where is golde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the golde of that land is good: there is Bdelium, and the Onix stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the name of the seconde riuer is Gihon: the same compasseth the whole lande of Cush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The name also of the third riuer is Hiddekel: this goeth toward the Eastside of Asshur: and the fourth riuer is Perath)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the Lord God tooke the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, that he might dresse it and keepe it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Thou shalt eate freely of euery tree of the garden,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But of the tree of knowledge of good and euill, thou shalt not eate of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die the death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Also the Lord God saide, It is not good that the man should be himself alone: I wil make him an helpe meete for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So the Lord God formed of the earth euery beast of the fielde, and euery foule of the heauen, and brought them vnto the man to see howe he would call them: for howsoeuer the man named the liuing creature, so was the name thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The man therefore gaue names vnto all cattell, and to the foule of the heauen, and to euery beast of the fielde: but for Adam founde he not an helpe meete for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore the Lord God caused an heauie sleepe to fall vpon the man, and he slept: and he tooke one of his ribbes, and closed vp the flesh in steade thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the ribbe which the Lord God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her to the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then the man said, This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shalbe called woman, because she was taken out of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore shall man leaue his father and his mother, and shall cleaue to his wife, and they shall be one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the serpent was more subtill then any beast of the fielde, which the Lord God had made: and he said to the woman, Yea, hath God in deede said, Ye shall not eate of euery tree of the garden?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the woman said vnto the serpent, We eate of the fruite of the trees of the garden,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But of the fruite of the tree which is in the middes of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate of it, neither shall ye touche it, lest ye die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not die at all,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But God doeth knowe, that when ye shall eate thereof, your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and euill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the woman (seeing that the tree was good for meate, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to get knowledge) tooke of the fruite thereof, and did eate, and gaue also to her husband with her, and he did eate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then the eyes of them both were opened, and they knewe that they were naked, and they sewed figge tree leaues together, and made them selues breeches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Afterward they heard the voyce of the Lord God walking in the garden in the coole of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselues from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But the Lord God called to the man, and said vnto him, Where art thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Who saide, I heard thy voyce in the garden, and was afraide: because I was naked, therefore I hid my selfe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he saide, Who tolde thee, that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eate?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the man saide, The woman which thou gauest to be with me, she gaue me of the tree, and I did eate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the Lord God saide to the woman, Why hast thou done this? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the Lord God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed aboue all cattell, and aboue euery beast of the fielde: vpon thy belly shalt thou goe, and dust shalt thou eate all the dayes of thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I will also put enimitie betweene thee and the woman, and betweene thy seede and her seede. He shall breake thine head, and thou shalt bruise his heele.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Vnto the woman he said, I will greatly increase thy sorowes, and thy conceptions. In sorowe shalt thou bring foorth children, and thy desire shalbe subiect to thine husband, and he shall rule ouer thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Also to Adam he said, Because thou hast obeyed the voyce of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, (whereof I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eate of it) cursed is the earth for thy sake: in sorowe shalt thou eate of it all the dayes of thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thornes also, and thistles shall it bring foorth to thee, and thou shalt eate the herbe of the fielde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In the sweate of thy face shalt thou eate bread, till thou returne to the earth: for out of it wast thou taken, because thou art dust, and to dust shalt thou returne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">(And the man called his wiues name Heuah, because she was the mother of all liuing)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Vnto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coates of skinnes, and clothed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the Lord God said, Beholde, the man is become as one of vs, to knowe good and euill. And nowe lest he put foorth his hand, and take also of ye tree of life and eate and liue for euer,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore the Lord God sent him foorth from the garden of Eden, to till ye earth, whence he was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Thus he cast out man, and at the East side of the garden of Eden he set the Cherubims, and the blade of a sworde shaken, to keepe the way of the tree of life.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Afterward the man knew Heuah his wife, which conceiued and bare Kain, and said, I haue obteined a man by the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And againe she brought foorth his brother Habel, and Habel was a keeper of sheepe, and Kain was a tiller of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in processe of time it came to passe, that Kain brought an oblation vnto the Lord of the fruite of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Habel also him selfe brought of the first fruites of his sheepe, and of the fat of them, and the Lord had respect vnto Habel, and to his offering,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But vnto Kain and to his offering he had no regarde: wherefore Kain was exceeding wroth, and his countenance fell downe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then ye Lord said vnto Kain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance cast downe?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If thou do well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sinne lieth at the doore: also vnto thee his desire shalbe subiect, and thou shalt rule ouer him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Kain spake to Habel his brother. And when they were in the fielde, Kain rose vp against Habel his brother, and slewe him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the Lord said vnto Kain, Where is Habel thy brother? Who answered, I cannot tell. Am I my brothers keeper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Againe he said, What hast thou done? the voyce of thy brothers blood cryeth vnto me from the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now therefore thou art cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receiue thy brothers blood from thine hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When thou shalt till the grounde, it shall not henceforth yeelde vnto thee her strength: a vagabond and a runnagate shalt thou be in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Kain said to the Lord, My punishment is greater, then I can beare.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, thou hast cast me out this day from the earth, and from thy face shall I be hid, and shalbe a vagabond, and a runnagate in the earth, and whosoeuer findeth me, shall slay me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the Lord said vnto him, Doubtlesse whosoeuer slayeth Kain, he shalbe punished seue folde. And the Lord set a marke vpon Kain, lest any man finding him should kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Kain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod towarde the Eastside of Eden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Kain also knewe his wife, which conceiued and bare Henoch: and he built a citie, and called the name of the citie by ye name of his sonne, Henoch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to Henoch was borne Irad, and Irad begate Mehuiael, and Mehuiael begate Methushael, and Methushael begate Lamech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Lamech tooke him two wiues: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adah bare Iabal, who was the father of such as dwell in the tents, and of such as haue cattell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And his brothers name was Iubal, who was the father of all that play on the harpe and organes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Zillah also bare Tubal-kain, who wrought cunningly euery craft of brasse and of yron: and the sister of Tubal-kain was Naamah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Lamech saide vnto his wiues Adah and Zillah, Heare my voyce, ye wiues of Lamech: hearken vnto my speach: for I would slay a man in my wound, and a yong man in mine hurt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If Kain shalbe auenged seuen folde, truely Lamech, seuentie times seuen folde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Adam knewe his wife againe, and she bare a sonne, and she called his name Sheth: for God, saide she, hath appointed me another seede for Habel, because Kain slewe him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And to ye same Sheth also there was borne a sonne, and he called his name Enosh. Then beganne men to call vpon the name of the Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">This is the booke of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created Adam, in the likenes of God made he him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam in the day that they were created.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Nowe Adam liued an hundred and thirtie yeeres, and begate a childe in his owne likenes after his image, and called his name Sheth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the dayes of Adam, after he had begotten Sheth, were eight hundreth yeeres, and he begate sonnes and daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So all the dayes that Adam liued, were nine hundreth and thirtie yeeres: and he died.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And we will bring againe the Arke of our God to vs: for we sought not vnto it in the dayes of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And all the Congregation answered, Let vs doe so: for the thing seemed good in the eyes of all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Dauid gathered all Israel together from Shihor in Egypt, euen vnto the entring of Hamath, to bring the Arke of God from Kiriath-iearim.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">So they came vp to Baal-perazim, and Dauid smote them there: and Dauid said, God hath deuided mine enemies with mine hande, as waters are deuided: therefore they called the name of that place, Baal-perazim.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For because ye were not there at the first, the Lord our God made a breach among vs: for we sought him not after due order.</VERS>
