    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, [and] fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, [I have given] every green herb for food: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the man called his wife`s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with [the help of] Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire, but do thou rule over it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother`s keeper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother`s blood crieth unto me from the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother`s blood from thy hand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have] cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And his brother`s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth. For, [said she], God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Moses said unto them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was wroth with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said unto them, This is that which Jehovah hath spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath unto Jehovah: bake that which ye will bake, and boil that which ye will boil; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath unto Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather, and they found none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">See, for that Jehovah hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Send thou men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a prince among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Jehovah: all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they went up by the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it upon a staff between two; [they brought] also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us; and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Howbeit the people that dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, [and] very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill-country; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died in this wilderness!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And wherefore doth Jehovah bring us unto this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: were it not better for us to return into Egypt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and they spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If Jehovah delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it unto us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Only rebel not against Jehovah, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is removed from over them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Moses said unto Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear it; for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that thou Jehovah art in the midst of this people; for thou Jehovah art seen face to face, and thy cloud standeth over them, and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now if thou shalt kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; and that will by no means clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Pardon, I pray thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy lovingkindness, and according as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to thy word:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">because all those men that have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that despised me see it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: to-morrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">How long [shall I bear] with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Say unto them, As I live, saith Jehovah, surely as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, that have murmured against me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I, Jehovah, have spoken, surely this will I do unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up unto the place which Jehovah hath promised: for we have sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of Jehovah, seeing it shall not prosper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Go not up, for Jehovah is not among you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned back from following Jehovah, therefore Jehovah will not be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who dwelt in that mountain, and smote them and beat them down, even unto Hormah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Rahab the harlot, and her father`s household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel unto this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for they are but few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them [from] before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do for thy great name?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, There is a devoted thing in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the devoted thing from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah taketh shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near by households; and the household which Jehovah shall take shall come near man by man.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And all the people, [even] the [men of] war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between him and Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers-in-wait that were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and set the city on fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the others came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">So [the lot] was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as hitherto Jehovah hath blessed me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Joshua said unto them, If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the children of Joseph said, The hill-country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power; thou shalt not have one lot only:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">but the hill-country shall be thine; for though it is a forest, thou shalt cut it down, and the goings out thereof shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, [and] in the midst of Manasseh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And it was so, that, when [any of] the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth; for he could not frame to pronounce it right: then they laid hold on him, and slew him at the fords of the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:</VERS>

And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But his father and his mother knew not that it was of Jehovah; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found favor in thy sight, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been showed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jehovah recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly unto thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And at meal-time Boaz said unto her, Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man`s name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yea, he said unto me, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that they meet thee not in any other field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests unto Jehovah, were there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Jehovah had shut up her womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And [as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto Jehovah, and wept sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And she said, Let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat; and her countenance was no more [sad].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Samuel, [saying], Because I have asked him of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, [I will not go up] until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only Jehovah establish his word. So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of Jehovah in Shiloh: and the child was young.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For this child I prayed; and Jehovah hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces; Against them will he thunder in heaven: Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; And he will give strength unto his king, And exalt the horn of his anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto Jehovah before Eli the priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest`s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priest`s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah; for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But Samuel ministered before Jehovah, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah`s people to transgress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because Jehovah was minded to slay them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Jehovah, and also with men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Did I reveal myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt [in bondage] to Pharaoh`s house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Jehovah will work for us; for there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And his armorbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn thee, behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto the men, and we will disclose ourselves unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armorbearer, Come up after me; for Jehovah hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armorbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armorbearer slew them after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armorbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow`s length in an acre of land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went [hither] and thither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Saul said unto Ahijah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was [there] at that time with the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and, behold, every man`s sword was against his fellow, [and there was] a very great discomfiture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as beforetime, and that went up with them into the camp, [from the country] round about, even they also [turned] to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted food.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Saul built an altar unto Jehovah: the same was the first altar that he built unto Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Saul said, Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of the people; and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For, as Jehovah liveth, who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Therefore Saul said unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, Show the right. And Jonathan and Saul were taken [by lot]; but the people escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and, lo, I must die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And Saul said, God do so and more also; for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he put [them] to the worse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that despoiled them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is before Egypt.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what Jehovah hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Samuel said, Though thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jonathan said unto David, Jehovah, the God of Israel, [be witness]: when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow, [or] the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and Jehovah be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Jehovah, that I die not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, not when Jehovah hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, [saying], And Jehovah will require it at the hand of David`s enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Jonathan said unto him, To-morrow is the new moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when thou hast stayed three days, thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And, behold, I will send the lad, [saying], Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as Jehovah liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But if I say thus unto the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for Jehovah hath sent thee away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between thee and me for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul`s side: but David`s place was empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Nevertheless Saul spake not anything that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, [which was] the second [day], that David`s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me [to be there]: and now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king`s table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then Saul`s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother`s nakedness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that is was determined of his father to put David to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he said unto his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan`s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But the lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of [a place] toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Now therefore what is under thy hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatsoever there is present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then to-day shall their vessels be holy?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the priest gave him holy [bread]; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before Jehovah, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</VERS>

If it be Jehovah that hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before Jehovah: for they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah`s anointed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah`s anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">(and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of] the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Tell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Ye mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of       offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan turned not back, And the sword of Saul returned not empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided: They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: Very pleasant hast thou been unto me: Thy love to me was wonderful, Passing the love of women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">How are the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.     And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, that ye have showed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now Jehovah show lovingkindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul`s host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Ish-bosheth, Saul`s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow`s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the battle was very sore that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it thou, Asahel? And he answered, It is I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Joab said, As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed every one his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David`s servants nineteen men and Asahel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner`s men, [so that] three hundred and threescore men died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day brake upon them at Hebron.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David`s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and [Ish-bosheth] said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father`s concubine?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog`s head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David; and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying [also], Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee: that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Saul`s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul`s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return: and he returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">now then do it; for Jehovah hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father`s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dieth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou       fall.     And all the people wept again over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David sware, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me: Jehovah reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when [Ish-bosheth], Saul`s son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And [Ish-bosheth], Saul`s son, [had] two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now Jonathan, Saul`s son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life; and Jehovah hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his tidings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah: and they anointed David king over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither; thinking, David cannot come in hither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David said on that day, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and [smite] the lame and the blind, that are hated of David`s soul. Wherefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel`s sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they left their images there; and David and his men took them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when David inquired of Jehovah, he said, Thou shalt not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is Jehovah gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And David did so, as Jehovah commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Jehovah of hosts that sitteth [above] the cherubim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah with all manner of [instruments made of] fir-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with castanets, and with cymbals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth [his hand] to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-uzzah, unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David was afraid of Jehovah that day; and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come unto me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So David would not remove the ark of Jehovah unto him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and Jehovah blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And it was so, that, when they that bare the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David danced before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David`s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said unto him, Why, O son of the king, art thou thus lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom`s sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, Let her sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon`s house, and dress him food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Tamar went to her brother Amnon`s house; and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And she said unto him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is [worse] than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And she had a garment of divers colors upon her; for with such robes were the king`s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Absalom spake unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king`s sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king`s sons go with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now, when Amnon`s heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king`s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king`s sons, and there is not one of them left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David`s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king`s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king`s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king`s sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king`s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And [the soul of] king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king`s heart was toward Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the woman of Tekoa spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they say, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father`s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king said, Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God take away life, but deviseth means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then thy handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Jehovah thy God be with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favor in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of his servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king`s face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year`s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king`s weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the king`s face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab`s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom`s servants set the field on fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king`s face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that, when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was so, that, when any man came nigh to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto Jehovah, in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David`s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the king`s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king: for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile; [return] to thine own place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And, lo, Zadok also [came], and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">but if he say thus, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art thou [not] a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">See, I will tarry at the fords of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they abode there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And David went up by the ascent of the [mount of] Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And it came to pass, that, when David was come to the top [of the ascent], where God was worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And David said unto him, If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father`s servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king`s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok`s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar`s son; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye shall hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So Hushai, David`s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when David was a little past the top [of the ascent], behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king`s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king said, And where is thy master`s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jehovah hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art [taken] in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it]? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done unto me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for [his] cursing of me this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David`s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, [Long] live the king, [Long] live the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And again, whom should I serve? [should I] not [serve] in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father`s presence, so will I be in thy presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father`s concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father`s concubines in the sight of all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">and I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: [so] all the people shall be in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do [after] his saying? if not, speak thou.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given this time is not good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Hushai said moreover, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some [other] place: and it will come to pass, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And even he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Jehovah had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And the woman took and spread the covering over the well`s mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Absalom`s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They are gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said unto David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan.</VERS>

And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succor us out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between heaven and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest it, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten [pieces of] silver, and a girdle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand [pieces of] silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king`s son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against [me].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And ten young men that bare Joab`s armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king`s dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom`s monument, unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that Jehovah hath avenged him of his enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king`s son is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king`s servant, even me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the king said, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought unto thee: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry a man with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate: and all the people came before the king.     Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Notwithstanding, the king`s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">all this, O king, doth Araunah give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, Jehovah thy God accept thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will verily buy it of thee at a price. Neither will I offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Concerning this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute mine ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house unto the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the walls [of the ceiling]: he built [them] for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the house, that is, the temple before [the oracle], was forty cubits [long].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And there was cedar on the house within, carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And within the oracle was [a space of] twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood: the lintel [and] door-posts were a fifth part [of the wall].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So [he made] two doors of olive-wood; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, out of a fourth part [of the wall];</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">and two doors of fir-wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he carved [thereon] cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Jehovah laid, in the month Ziv.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And it was covered with cedar above over the forty and five beams, that were upon the pillars; fifteen in a row.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And all the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he made the porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And his house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh`s daughter (whom Solomon had taken to wife), like unto this porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar-wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the great court round about had three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and the porch of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits compassed either of them about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">There were nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars: and so did he for the other capital.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon the other capital.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about: the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And it was a handbreadth thick: and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters: beneath the laver were the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were gravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base: the undersetters thereof were of the base itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the panels thereof were of the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the panels thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and every laver was four cubits; and upon very one of the ten bases one laver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of Jehovah, were of burnished brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed], because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Jehovah: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple, of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, [even] the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers` [houses] of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I have surely built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David thy father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jehovah hath established his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="64">The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the king`s house</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of Jehovah, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon`s wife.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">These were the chief officers that were over Solomon`s work, five hundred and fifty, who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Pharaoh`s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which [Solomon] had built for her: then did he build Millo.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hid from the king which he told her not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because Jehovah loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do justice and righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees and precious stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the king made of the almug-trees pillars for the house of Jehovah, and for the king`s house, harps also and psalteries for the singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor were seen, unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Jehovah hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And [Micaiah] said, Therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner; and another said on that manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king`s son;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots washed themselves [there]); according unto the word of Jehovah which he spake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="44">And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now therefore thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the messengers returned unto him, and he said unto them, Why is it that ye are returned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they said unto him, There came up a man to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said unto them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then [the king] sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he spake unto him, O man of God, the king hath said, Come down.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Elijah said unto him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off: and they two stood by the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: [nevertheless], if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, [there appeared] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!     And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided hither and thither; and Elisha went over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they said unto him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest the Spirit of Jehovah hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered unto the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days` journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king of Israel said, Alas! for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israel`s servants answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay; for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, Make this valley full of trenches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this is but a light thing in the sight of Jehovah: he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have smitten each man his fellow: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth [only] they left the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to break through unto the king of Edom; but they could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear Jehovah: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two children to be bondmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me; what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And thou shalt go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and thou shalt set aside that which is full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought [the vessels] to her, and she poured out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons of the rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passeth by us continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said, At this season, when the time cometh round, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thy handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to his servant, Carry him to his mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] upon him, and went out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So she went, and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel.     And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">run, I pray thee, now to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed within her; and Jehovah hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Jehovah had given victory unto Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, [but he was] a leper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman`s wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And she said unto her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then went he down, and dipped [himself] seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray thee, let there be given to thy servant two mules` burden of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant: when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon thy servant in this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Jehovah liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And he said unto him, Went not my heart [with thee], when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid-servants?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow: they were of Saul`s brethren of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The chief was Ahiezer; then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David to the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, that could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the roes upon the mountains;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">These of the sons of Gad were captains of the host: he that was least was equal to a hundred, and the greatest to a thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">These are they that went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold unto David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, my heart shall be knit unto you; but if [ye be come] to betray me to mine adversaries, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, [and he said], Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not; for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall away to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands that were of Manasseh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they helped David against the band of rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the host.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great host, like the host of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And these are the numbers of the heads of them that were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">And of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">All these being men of war, that could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brethren had made preparation for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Moreover they that were nigh unto them, [even] as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, victuals of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David said unto all the assembly of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and if it be of Jehovah our God, let us send abroad every where unto our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we sought not unto it in the days of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And all the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor [the brook] of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, [that is], to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God Jehovah that sitteth [above] the cherubim, that is called by the Name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart, [and brought it] out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when they came unto the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzza; and he called that place Perez-uzza, unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So David removed not the ark unto him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months: and Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel`s sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David begat more sons and daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And David did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And [David] made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath Jehovah chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah unto its place, which he had prepared for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and said unto them, Ye are the heads of the fathers` [houses] of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto [the place] that I have prepared for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For because ye [bare it] not at the first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not according to the ordinance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, [were appointed] with cymbals of brass to sound aloud;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries set to Alamoth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps set to the Sheminith, to lead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song [with] the singers: and David had upon him an ephod of linen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with psalteries and harps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion [of flesh], and a cake of raisins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Jehovah, the God of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">O give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known his doings among the peoples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvellous works.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">He is Jehovah our God; His judgments are in all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Remember his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">[The covenant] which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He also is to be feared above all gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For all the gods of the peoples are idols: But Jehovah made the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and gladness are in his place.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah [dwelleth] under curtains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from [one] tabernacle [to another].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of Jehovah, and his own house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, that were not of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">of their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, of them did Solomon raise a levy [of bondservants] unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And these were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of Jehovah hath come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Solomon offered burnt-offerings unto Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah, which he had built before the porch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, [even] in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah, and until it was finished. [So] the house of Jehovah was completed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hid from Solomon which he told her not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, his cupbearers also, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: thou exceedest the fame that I heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne, to be king for Jehovah thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, that brought gold from Ophir, brought algum-trees and precious stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the king made of the algum-trees terraces for the house of Jehovah, and for the king`s house, and harps and psalteries for the singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">besides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred [shekels] of beaten gold went to one buckler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred [shekels] of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">nd there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And all king Solomon`s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he ruled over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon,) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spake to Rehoboam, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father`s loins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was brought about of God, that Jehovah might establish his word, which he spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So all Israel departed unto their tents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they hearkened unto the words of Jehovah, and returned from going against Jeroboam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He built Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And in every city [he put] shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. And Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest`s office unto Jehovah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, [and of] Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and she bare him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines, and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, [even] the prince among his brethren; for [he was minded] to make him king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fortified city: and he gave them victuals in abundance. And he sought [for them] many wives.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Jehovah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen. And the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came unto Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Ye have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Jehovah is righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king`s house: he took all away: he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the door of the king`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it was so, that, as oft as the king entered into the house of Jehovah, the guard came and bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he humbled himself, the wrath of Jehovah turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and moreover in Judah there were good things [found].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother`s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of [other] lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of [them that are] no gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and [we have] priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also [set they] in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Jehovah came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Jehovah is with you, while ye are with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now for a long season Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when in their distress they turned unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in; but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God did vex them with all adversity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But be ye strong, and let not your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went unto Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and slew him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And the house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king`s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers` [houses] of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath; with those that were to go out on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David`s, which were in the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.</VERS>

Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason! treason!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword: for the priest said, Slay her not in the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they made way for her; and she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king`s house: and they slew her there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Jehovah`s people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of Jehovah under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of Jehovah, to offer the burnt-offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he set the porters at the gates of the house of Jehovah, that none that was unclean in anything should enter in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah: and they came through the upper gate unto the king`s house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Zibiah, of Beer-sheba.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of Jehovah, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of Jehovah did they bestow upon the Baalim.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And it was so, that, at what time the chest was brought unto the king`s officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king`s scribe and the chief priest`s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Jehovah, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of Jehovah, so that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken Jehovah, he hath also forsaken you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established unto him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he put not their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers` houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for Jehovah is not with Israel, [to wit], with all the children of Ephraim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if thou wilt go, do [valiantly], be strong for the battle: God will cast thee down before the enemy; for God hath power to help, and to cast down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah is able to give thee much more than this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Amaziah separated them, [to wit], the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And [other] ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote of them three thousand, and took much spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Wherefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, who said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that [the king] said unto him, Have we made thee of the king`s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten Edom; and thy heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to [thy] hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand [of their enemies], because they had sought after the gods of Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And [he took] all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king`s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following Jehovah they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">For Jehovah brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed sore against Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but it helped him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Jehovah, this same king Ahaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, [therefore] will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of his fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="29">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto Jehovah; come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of Jehovah.

      <VERS vnumber="32">And the number of the burnt-offerings which the assembly brought was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="30">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves unto Jehovah, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever, and serve Jehovah your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if ye turn again unto Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth [day] of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings into the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood [which they received] of the hand of the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For there were many in the assembly that had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Jehovah pardon every one</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">that setteth his heart to seek God, Jehovah, the God of his fathers, though [he be] not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, [singing] with loud instruments unto Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that had good understanding [in the service] of Jehovah. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept [other] seven days with gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even unto heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and brake down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">[He appointed] also the king`s portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings, [to wit], for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times from all places, Ye must return unto us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set [there] the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They all builded the wall and they that bare burdens laded themselves; every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">in what place soever ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us; our God will fight for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one [went with] his weapon [to] the water.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king`s tribute [upon] our fields and our vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage [already]: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold unto the nations; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [one of] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, [O God], strengthen thou my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty and two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard [thereof], that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. [And] Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand [on guard], let them shut the doors, and bar ye them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one [to be] over against his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them that came up at the first, and I found written therein:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews` language, but according to the language of each people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and fourscore days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king`s palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">[There were hangings of] white [cloth], [of] green, and [of] blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and white, and yellow, and black marble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the drinking was according to the law; none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man`s pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king`s commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king`s manner toward all that knew law and judgment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and the next unto him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king`s face, and sat first in the kingdom),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen say [the like] unto all the king`s princes. So [will there arise] much contempt and wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the king`s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">for he sent letters into all the king`s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then said the king`s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king`s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle`s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So it came to pass, when the king`s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king`s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the king`s house: and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women`s house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, [to wit], six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">then in this wise came the maiden unto the king: whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king`s chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king`s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther`s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king`s gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king`s gate, two of the king`s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king [thereof] in Mordecai`s name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And all the king`s servants, that were in the king`s gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the king`s servants, that were in the king`s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king`s commandment?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai`s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, [to] the twelfth [month], which is the month Adar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from [those of] every people; neither keep they the king`s laws: therefore it is not for the king`s profit to suffer them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the [king`s] business, to bring it into the king`s treasuries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews` enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then were the king`s scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof; and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king`s satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king`s ring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And letters were sent by posts into all the king`s provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The posts went forth in haste by the king`s commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and he came even before the king`s gate: for none might enter within the king`s gate clothed with sackcloth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in every province, whithersoever the king`s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Esther`s maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he received it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king`s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king`s gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king`s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Esther spake unto Hathach, and gave him a message unto Mordecai [saying]:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All the king`s servants, and the people of the king`s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they told to Mordecai Esther`s words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Mordecai bade them return answer unto Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king`s house, more than all the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father`s house will perish: and who knoweth whether thou art not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king`s house, over against the king`s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Esther said, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king`s gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by her together with the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king`s gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king`s chamberlains, of those that kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then said the king`s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king`s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king`s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Haman said unto the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on the head of which a crown royal is set:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king`s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">While they were yet talking with him, came the king`s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="18" bname="Job" bsname="Job">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and turned away from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother`s house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and the Sabeans fell [upon them], and took them away: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother`s house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and he said, Naked came I out of my mother`s womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jehovah said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when Job`s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Let that day be darkness; Let not God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine upon it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Lo, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</VERS>
