<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">for attaining wisdom and discipline; for understanding words of insight;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">for acquiring a disciplined and prudent life, doing what is right and just and fair;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">for giving prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">They will be a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">My son, if sinners entice you, do not give in to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">If they say, "Come along with us; let's lie in wait for someone's blood, let's waylay some harmless soul;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">let's swallow them alive, like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">throw in your lot with us, and we will share a common purse"-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">for their feet rush into sin, they are swift to shed blood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">How useless to spread a net in full view of all the birds!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">These men lie in wait for their own blood; they waylay only themselves!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Such is the end of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the lives of those who get it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the public squares;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">at the head of the noisy streets she cries out, in the gateways of the city she makes her speech:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">If you had responded to my rebuke, I would have poured out my heart to you and made my thoughts known to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">But since you rejected me when I called and no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">since you ignored all my advice and would not accept my rebuke,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">I in turn will laugh at your disaster; I will mock when calamity overtakes you-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">"Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">For the LORD gives wisdom, and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He holds victory in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then you will understand what is right and just and fair-every good path.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">It will save you also from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Thus you will walk in the ways of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">for they will prolong your life many years and bring you prosperity.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and shun evil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Honor the LORD with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline and do not resent his rebuke,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">because the LORD disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gains understanding,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who lay hold of her will be blessed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">By wisdom the LORD laid the earth's foundations, by understanding he set the heavens in place;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">by his knowledge the deeps were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">My son, preserve sound judgment and discernment, do not let them out of your sight;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">they will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">when you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Have no fear of sudden disaster or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being snared.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Do not withhold good from those who deserve it, when it is in your power to act.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Do not say to your neighbor, "Come back later; I'll give it tomorrow"- when you now have it with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who lives trustfully near you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Do not accuse a man for no reason- when he has done you no harm.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">for the LORD detests a perverse man but takes the upright into his confidence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">He mocks proud mockers but gives grace to the humble.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">The wise inherit honor, but fools he holds up to shame.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">Listen, my sons, to a father's instruction; pay attention and gain understanding.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I give you sound learning, so do not forsake my teaching.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When I was a boy in my father's house, still tender, and an only child of my mother,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">he taught me and said, "Lay hold of my words with all your heart; keep my commands and you will live.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or swerve from them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Wisdom is supreme; therefore get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Esteem her, and she will exalt you; embrace her, and she will honor you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">She will set a garland of grace on your head and present you with a crown of splendor."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Listen, my son, accept what I say, and the years of your life will be many.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">I guide you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When you walk, your steps will not be hampered; when you run, you will not stumble.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; guard it well, for it is your life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evil men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go on your way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">For they cannot sleep till they do evil; they are robbed of slumber till they make someone fall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn, shining ever brighter till the full light of day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">My son, pay attention to what I say; listen closely to my words.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">for they are life to those who find them and health to a man's whole body.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Put away perversity from your mouth; keep corrupt talk far from your lips.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Let your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Do not swerve to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">My son, pay attention to my wisdom, listen well to my words of insight,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">For the lips of an adulteress drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths are crooked, but she knows it not.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">lest you give your best strength to others and your years to one who is cruel,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich another man's house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">At the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">You will say, "How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned correction!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I would not obey my teachers or listen to my instructors.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">I have come to the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Should your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">A loving doe, a graceful deer- may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be captivated by her love.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another man's wife?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">For a man's ways are in full view of the LORD, and he examines all his paths.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The evil deeds of a wicked man ensnare him; the cords of his sin hold him fast.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">He will die for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have struck hands in pledge for another,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">if you have been trapped by what you said, ensnared by the words of your mouth,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">then do this, my son, to free yourself, since you have fallen into your neighbor's hands: Go and humble yourself; press your plea with your neighbor!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Allow no sleep to your eyes, no slumber to your eyelids.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">It has no commander, no overseer or ruler,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">A scoundrel and villain, who goes about with a corrupt mouth,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">who winks with his eye, signals with his feet and motions with his fingers,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">who plots evil with deceit in his heart- he always stirs up dissension.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant; he will suddenly be destroyed-without remedy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">There are six things the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to him:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">My son, keep your father's commands and do not forsake your mother's teaching.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Bind them upon your heart forever; fasten them around your neck.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">For these commands are a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the corrections of discipline are the way to life,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">keeping you from the immoral woman, from the smooth tongue of the wayward wife.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread, and the adulteress preys upon your very life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">So is he who sleeps with another man's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">But a man who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">for jealousy arouses a husband's fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse the bribe, however great it is.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">My son, keep my words and store up my commands within you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Keep my commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call understanding your kinsman;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">they will keep you from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">At the window of my house I looked out through the lattice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">I saw among the simple, I noticed among the young men, a youth who lacked judgment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He was going down the street near her corner, walking along in the direction of her house</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">at twilight, as the day was fading, as the dark of night set in.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then out came a woman to meet him, dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">(She is loud and defiant, her feet never stay at home;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">now in the street, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"I have fellowship offerings at home; today I fulfilled my vows.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So I came out to meet you; I looked for you and have found you!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Come, let's drink deep of love till morning; let's enjoy ourselves with love!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">My husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">Does not wisdom call out? Does not understanding raise her voice?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">On the heights along the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">beside the gates leading into the city, at the entrances, she cries aloud:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"To you, O men, I call out; I raise my voice to all mankind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">You who are simple, gain prudence; you who are foolish, gain understanding.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Listen, for I have worthy things to say; I open my lips to speak what is right.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">My mouth speaks what is true, for my lips detest wickedness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">All the words of my mouth are just; none of them is crooked or perverse.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">To the discerning all of them are right; they are faultless to those who have knowledge.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Choose my instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice gold,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">for wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can compare with her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence; I possess knowledge and discretion.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have understanding and power.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">By me kings reign and rulers make laws that are just;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">by me princes govern, and all nobles who rule on earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and prosperity.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">My fruit is better than fine gold; what I yield surpasses choice silver.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">bestowing wealth on those who love me and making their treasuries full.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"The LORD brought me forth as the first of his works,, before his deeds of old;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">I was appointed from eternity, from the beginning, before the world began.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">When there were no oceans, I was given birth, when there were no springs abounding with water;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was given birth,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">before he made the earth or its fields or any of the dust of the world.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">when he established the clouds above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">when he gave the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then I was the craftsman at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">"Now then, my sons, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not ignore it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">For whoever finds me finds life and receives favor from the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">But whoever fails to find me harms himself; all who hate me love death."</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out its seven pillars.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">The words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">What does man gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Is there anything of which one can say, "Look! This is something new"? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">There is no remembrance of men of old, and even those who are yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">What is twisted cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">I thought to myself, "Look, I have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">I thought in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good." But that also proved to be meaningless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Laughter," I said, "is foolish. And what does pleasure accomplish?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly-my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women singers, and a harem as well-the delights of the heart of man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king's successor do than what has already been done?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The wise man has eyes in his head, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then I thought in my heart, "The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?" I said in my heart, "This too is meaningless."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered; in days to come both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the wise man too must die!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the work into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">All his days his work is pain and grief; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is meaningless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">A man can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">To the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">What does the worker gain from his toil?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">I have seen the burden God has laid on men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">That everyone may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all his toil-this is the gift of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment-wickedness was there, in the place of justice-wickedness was there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I thought in my heart, "God will bring to judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time for every deed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">I also thought, "As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is meaningless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So I saw that there is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work, because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see what will happen after him?</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed- and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors- and they have no comforter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And I saw that all labor and all achievement spring from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The fool folds his hands and ruins himself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. "For whom am I toiling," he asked, "and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?" This too is meaningless- a miserable business!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take warning.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king's successor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they do wrong.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">As a dream comes when there are many cares, so the speech of a fool when there are many words.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the temple messenger, "My vow was a mistake." Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore stand in awe of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">If you see the poor oppressed in a district, and justice and rights denied, do not be surprised at such things; for one official is eyed by a higher one, and over them both are others higher still.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The increase from the land is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Whoever loves money never has money enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his income. This too is meaningless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">As goods increase, so do those who consume them. And what benefit are they to the owner except to feast his eyes on them?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of a rich man permits him no sleep.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I have seen a grievous evil under the sun: wealth hoarded to the harm of its owner,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">or wealth lost through some misfortune, so that when he has a son there is nothing left for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Naked a man comes from his mother's womb, and as he comes, so he departs. He takes nothing from his labor that he can carry in his hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">This too is a grievous evil: As a man comes, so he departs, and what does he gain, since he toils for the wind?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">All his days he eats in darkness, with great frustration, affliction and anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then I realized that it is good and proper for a man to eat and drink, and to find satisfaction in his toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given him-for this is his lot.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Moreover, when God gives any man wealth and possessions, and enables him to enjoy them, to accept his lot and be happy in his work-this is a gift of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">He seldom reflects on the days of his life, because God keeps him occupied with gladness of heart.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on men:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">God gives a man wealth, possessions and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires, but God does not enable him to enjoy them, and a stranger enjoys them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">All man's efforts are for his mouth, yet his appetite is never satisfied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">What advantage has a wise man over a fool? What does a poor man gain by knowing how to conduct himself before others?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Better what the eye sees than the roving of the appetite. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Whatever exists has already been named, and what man is has been known; no man can contend with one who is stronger than he.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The more the words, the less the meaning, and how does that profit anyone?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">For who knows what is good for a man in life, during the few and meaningless days he passes through like a shadow? Who can tell him what will happen under the sun after he is gone?</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of every man; the living should take this to heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Sorrow is better than laughter, because a sad face is good for the heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">It is better to heed a wise man's rebuke than to listen to the song of fools.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Extortion turns a wise man into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Do not say, "Why were the old days better than these?" For it is not wise to ask such questions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing and benefits those who see the sun.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: that wisdom preserves the life of its possessor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Consider what God has done: Who can straighten what he has made crooked?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, a man cannot discover anything about his future.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these: a righteous man perishing in his righteousness, and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Do not be overrighteous, neither be overwise- why destroy yourself?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Do not be overwicked, and do not be a fool- why die before your time?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other. The man who fears God will avoid all extremes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Wisdom makes one wise man more powerful than ten rulers in a city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">All this I tested by wisdom and I said, "I am determined to be wise"- but this was beyond me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Whatever wisdom may be, it is far off and most profound- who can discover it?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the madness of folly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">"Look," says the Teacher, "this is what I have discovered: "Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">while I was still searching but not finding- I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">This only have I found: God made mankind upright, but men have gone in search of many schemes."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">Who is like the wise man? Who knows the explanation of things? Wisdom brightens a man's face and changes its hard appearance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Obey the king's command, I say, because you took an oath before God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Do not be in a hurry to leave the king's presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Since a king's word is supreme, who can say to him, "What are you doing?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm, and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, though a man's misery weighs heavily upon him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Since no man knows the future, who can tell him what is to come?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">No man has power over the wind to contain it; so no one has power over the day of his death. As no one is discharged in time of war, so wickedness will not release those who practice it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own hurt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then too, I saw the wicked buried-those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise in the city where they did this. This too is meaningless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, the hearts of the people are filled with schemes to do wrong.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Although a wicked man commits a hundred crimes and still lives a long time, I know that it will go better with God-fearing men, who are reverent before God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: righteous men who get what the wicked deserve, and wicked men who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So I commend the enjoyment of life, because nothing is better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany him in his work all the days of the life God has given him under the sun.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe man's labor on earth-his eyes not seeing sleep day or night-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all his efforts to search it out, man cannot discover its meaning. Even if a wise man claims he knows, he cannot really comprehend it.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God's hands, but no man knows whether love or hate awaits him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">All share a common destiny-the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. As it is with the good man, so with the sinner; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of men, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Anyone who is among the living has hope -even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for it is now that God favors what you do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun- all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Moreover, no man knows when his hour will come: As fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare, so men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siegeworks against it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So I said, "Wisdom is better than strength." But the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Even as he walks along the road, the fool lacks sense and shows everyone how stupid he is.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">If a ruler's anger rises against you, do not leave your post; calmness can lay great errors to rest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">There is an evil I have seen under the sun, the sort of error that arises from a ruler:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Fools are put in many high positions, while the rich occupy the low ones.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them; whoever splits logs may be endangered by them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed but skill will bring success.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">If a snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Words from a wise man's mouth are gracious, but a fool is consumed by his own lips.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">At the beginning his words are folly; at the end they are wicked madness-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">and the fool multiplies words. No one knows what is coming- who can tell him what will happen after him?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">A fool's work wearies him; he does not know the way to town.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Woe to you, O land whose king was a servant and whose princes feast in the morning.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Blessed are you, O land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time- for strength and not for drunkenness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">If a man is lazy, the rafters sag; if his hands are idle, the house leaks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich in your bedroom, because a bird of the air may carry your words, and a bird on the wing may report what you say.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
<VERS vnumber="1">Cast your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Give portions to seven, yes to eight, for you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">If clouds are full of water, they pour rain upon the earth. Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where it falls, there will it lie.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Whoever watches the wind will not plant; whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Sow your seed in the morning, and at evening let not your hands be idle, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both will do equally well.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Light is sweet, and it pleases the eyes to see the sun.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">However many years a man may live, let him enjoy them all. But let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. Everything to come is meaningless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Be happy, young man, while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see, but know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So then, banish anxiety from your heart and cast off the troubles of your body, for youth and vigor are meaningless.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
<VERS vnumber="1">Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say, "I find no pleasure in them"-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark, and the clouds return after the rain;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, when the grinders cease because they are few, and those looking through the windows grow dim;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades; when men rise up at the sound of birds, but all their songs grow faint;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">when men are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets; when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags himself along and desire no longer is stirred. Then man goes to his eternal home and mourners go about the streets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Remember him-before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, or the wheel broken at the well,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Everything is meaningless!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Not only was the Teacher wise, but also he imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails-given by one Shepherd.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="2">Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth- for your love is more delightful than wine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Pleasing is the fragrance of your perfumes; your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the maidens love you!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Take me away with you-let us hurry! Let the king bring me into his chambers. We rejoice and delight in you; we will praise your love more than wine. How right they are to adore you!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Dark am I, yet lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, dark like the tents of Kedar, like the tent curtains of Solomon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Do not stare at me because I am dark, because I am darkened by the sun. My mother's sons were angry with me and made me take care of the vineyards; my own vineyard I have neglected.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Tell me, you whom I love, where you graze your flock and where you rest your sheep at midday. Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your friends?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">If you do not know, most beautiful of women, follow the tracks of the sheep and graze your young goats by the tents of the shepherds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I liken you, my darling, to a mare harnessed to one of the chariots of Pharaoh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with strings of jewels.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. "Have you seen the one my heart loves?"</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">If only you were to me like a brother, who was nursed at my mother's breasts! Then, if I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I would lead you and bring you to my mother's house- she who has taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">His left arm is under my head and his right arm embraces me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Who is this coming up from the desert leaning on her lover? Under the apple tree I roused you; there your mother conceived you, there she who was in labor gave you birth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot wash it away. If one were to give all the wealth of his house for love, it would be utterly scorned.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">We have a young sister, and her breasts are not yet grown. What shall we do for our sister for the day she is spoken for?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">If she is a wall, we will build towers of silver on her. If she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. Thus I have become in his eyes like one bringing contentment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon; he let out his vineyard to tenants. Each was to bring for its fruit a thousand shekels of silver.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But my own vineyard is mine to give; the thousand shekels are for you, O Solomon, and two hundred are for those who tend its fruit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">You who dwell in the gardens with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Come away, my lover, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the spice-laden mountains.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: "I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?" says the LORD. "I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- I cannot bear your evil assemblies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"Come now, let us reason together," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her- but now murderers!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: "Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as chief among the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">You have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and clasp hands with pagans.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So man will be brought low and mankind humbled- do not forgive them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Go into the rocks, hide in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The eyes of the arrogant man will be humbled and the pride of men brought low; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The LORD Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted (and they will be humbled),</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty, and all the oaks of Bashan,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">for all the towering mountains and all the high hills,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">for every lofty tower and every fortified wall,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">for every trading ship and every stately vessel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The arrogance of man will be brought low and the pride of men humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">and the idols will totally disappear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Men will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">In that day men will throw away to the rodents and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">They will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhanging crags from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Stop trusting in man, who has but a breath in his nostrils. Of what account is he?</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">See now, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: all supplies of food and all supplies of water,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">the hero and warrior, the judge and prophet, the soothsayer and elder,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">the captain of fifty and man of rank, the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever enchanter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I will make boys their officials; mere children will govern them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">People will oppress each other- man against man, neighbor against neighbor. The young will rise up against the old, the base against the honorable.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">A man will seize one of his brothers at his father's home, and say, "You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But in that day he will cry out, "I have no remedy. I have no food or clothing in my house; do not make me the leader of the people."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Jerusalem staggers, Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them! They will be paid back for what their hands have done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Youths oppress my people, women rule over them. O my people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The LORD takes his place in court; he rises to judge the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: "It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?" declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The LORD says, "The women of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, tripping along with mincing steps, with ornaments jingling on their ankles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion; the LORD will make their scalps bald."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">the earrings and bracelets and veils,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">the headdresses and ankle chains and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">the signet rings and nose rings,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, "We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">In that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over all the glory will be a canopy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard: My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines. He built a watchtower in it and cut out a winepress as well. Then he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">What more could have been done for my vineyard than I have done for it? When I looked for good grapes, why did it yield only bad?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Now I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it will be destroyed; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">I will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated, and briers and thorns will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The vineyard of the LORD Almighty is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the garden of his delight. And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard cries of distress.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The LORD Almighty has declared in my hearing: "Surely the great houses will become desolate, the fine mansions left without occupants.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine, a homer of seed only an ephah of grain."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after their drinks, who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They have harps and lyres at their banquets, tambourines and flutes and wine, but they have no regard for the deeds of the LORD, no respect for the work of his hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding; their men of rank will die of hunger and their masses will be parched with thirst.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Therefore the grave enlarges its appetite and opens its mouth without limit; into it will descend their nobles and masses with all their brawlers and revelers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So man will be brought low and mankind humbled, the eyes of the arrogant humbled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But the LORD Almighty will be exalted by his justice, and the holy God will show himself holy by his righteousness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture; lambs will feed among the ruins of the rich.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit, and wickedness as with cart ropes,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">to those who say, "Let God hurry, let him hasten his work so we may see it. Let it approach, let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come, so we may know it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice to the innocent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw and as dry grass sinks down in the flames, so their roots will decay and their flowers blow away like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD Almighty and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Therefore the LORD's anger burns against his people; his hand is raised and he strikes them down. The mountains shake, and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He lifts up a banner for the distant nations, he whistles for those at the ends of the earth. Here they come, swiftly and speedily!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Not one of them grows tired or stumbles, not one slumbers or sleeps; not a belt is loosened at the waist, not a sandal thong is broken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Their arrows are sharp, all their bows are strung; their horses' hoofs seem like flint, their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Their roar is like that of the lion, they roar like young lions; they growl as they seize their prey and carry it off with no one to rescue.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">In that day they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea. And if one looks at the land, he will see darkness and distress; even the light will be darkened by the clouds.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, and the train of his robe filled the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Above him were seraphs, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">And they were calling to one another: "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Woe to me!" I cried. "I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">With it he touched my mouth and said, "See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?" And I said, "Here am I. Send me!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He said, "Go and tell this people: "'Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Make the heart of this people calloused; make their ears dull and close their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then I said, "For how long, O Lord?" And he answered: "Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant, until the houses are left deserted and the fields ruined and ravaged,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">until the LORD has sent everyone far away and the land is utterly forsaken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And though a tenth remains in the land, it will again be laid waste. But as the terebinth and oak leave stumps when they are cut down, so the holy seed will be the stump in the land."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Now the house of David was told, "Aram has allied itself with Ephraim"; so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go out, you and your son Shear-Jashub, to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Say to him, 'Be careful, keep calm and don't be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood-because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah's son have plotted your ruin, saying,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'It will not take place, it will not happen,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">for the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is only Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah's son. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Ask the LORD your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But Ahaz said, "I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then Isaiah said, "Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God also?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah-he will bring the king of Assyria."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">In that day the LORD will whistle for flies from the distant streams of Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">In that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the River -the king of Assyria-to shave your head and the hair of your legs, and to take off your beards also.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">In that day, a man will keep alive a young cow and two goats.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">And because of the abundance of the milk they give, he will have curds to eat. All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">In that day, in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, there will be only briers and thorns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Men will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">As for all the hills once cultivated by the hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and thorns; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD said to me, "Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary pen: Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And I will call in Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as reliable witnesses for me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the LORD said to me, "Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Before the boy knows how to say 'My father' or 'My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The LORD spoke to me again:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices over Rezin and the son of Remaliah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">therefore the Lord is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the River - the king of Assyria with all his pomp. It will overflow all its channels, run over all its banks</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">and sweep on into Judah, swirling over it, passing through it and reaching up to the neck. Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land, O Immanuel!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Raise the war cry, you nations, and be shattered! Listen, all you distant lands. Prepare for battle, and be shattered! Prepare for battle, and be shattered!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted; propose your plan, but it will not stand, for God is with us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The LORD spoke to me with his strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people. He said:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"Do not call conspiracy everything that these people call conspiracy; do not fear what they fear, and do not dread it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The LORD Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, he is the one you are to fear, he is the one you are to dread,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">and he will be a sanctuary; but for both houses of Israel he will be a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Many of them will stumble; they will fall and be broken, they will be snared and captured."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Bind up the testimony and seal up the law among my disciples.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob. I will put my trust in him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the Gentiles, by the way of the sea, along the Jordan-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy; they rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest, as men rejoice when dividing the plunder.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">For as in the day of Midian's defeat, you have shattered the yoke that burdens them, the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Every warrior's boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning, will be fuel for the fire.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The Lord has sent a message against Jacob; it will fall on Israel.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">In the year that the supreme commander, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">at that time the LORD spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz. He said to him, "Take off the sackcloth from your body and the sandals from your feet." And he did so, going around stripped and barefoot.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then the LORD said, "Just as my servant Isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot for three years, as a sign and portent against Egypt and Cush,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">so the king of Assyria will lead away stripped and barefoot the Egyptian captives and Cushite exiles, young and old, with buttocks bared-to Egypt's shame.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Those who trusted in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be afraid and put to shame.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">In that day the people who live on this coast will say, 'See what has happened to those we relied on, those we fled to for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?'"</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
<VERS vnumber="1">An oracle concerning the Desert by the Sea: Like whirlwinds sweeping through the southland, an invader comes from the desert, from a land of terror.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">A dire vision has been shown to me: The traitor betrays, the looter takes loot. Elam, attack! Media, lay siege! I will bring to an end all the groaning she caused.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">At this my body is racked with pain, pangs seize me, like those of a woman in labor; I am staggered by what I hear, I am bewildered by what I see.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">My heart falters, fear makes me tremble; the twilight I longed for has become a horror to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">They set the tables, they spread the rugs, they eat, they drink! Get up, you officers, oil the shields!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">This is what the Lord says to me: "Go, post a lookout and have him report what he sees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When he sees chariots with teams of horses, riders on donkeys or riders on camels, let him be alert, fully alert."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And the lookout shouted, "Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower; every night I stay at my post.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Look, here comes a man in a chariot with a team of horses. And he gives back the answer: 'Babylon has fallen, has fallen! All the images of its gods lie shattered on the ground!'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">O my people, crushed on the threshing floor, I tell you what I have heard from the LORD Almighty, from the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">An oracle concerning Dumah: Someone calls to me from Seir, "Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The watchman replies, "Morning is coming, but also the night. If you would ask, then ask; and come back yet again."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">An oracle concerning Arabia: You caravans of Dedanites, who camp in the thickets of Arabia,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">bring water for the thirsty; you who live in Tema, bring food for the fugitives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">They flee from the sword, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow and from the heat of battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">This is what the Lord says to me: "Within one year, as a servant bound by contract would count it, all the pomp of Kedar will come to an end.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The survivors of the bowmen, the warriors of Kedar, will be few." The LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
<VERS vnumber="1">An oracle concerning the Valley of Vision: What troubles you now, that you have all gone up on the roofs,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">O town full of commotion, O city of tumult and revelry? Your slain were not killed by the sword, nor did they die in battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">All your leaders have fled together; they have been captured without using the bow. All you who were caught were taken prisoner together, having fled while the enemy was still far away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Therefore I said, "Turn away from me; let me weep bitterly. Do not try to console me over the destruction of my people."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord, the LORD Almighty, has a day of tumult and trampling and terror in the Valley of Vision, a day of battering down walls and of crying out to the mountains.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Elam takes up the quiver, with her charioteers and horses; Kir uncovers the shield.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Your choicest valleys are full of chariots, and horsemen are posted at the city gates;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">the defenses of Judah are stripped away. And you looked in that day to the weapons in the Palace of the Forest;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">you saw that the City of David had many breaches in its defenses; you stored up water in the Lower Pool.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">You counted the buildings in Jerusalem and tore down houses to strengthen the wall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">You built a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the Old Pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or have regard for the One who planned it long ago.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The Lord, the LORD Almighty, called you on that day to weep and to wail, to tear out your hair and put on sackcloth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But see, there is joy and revelry, slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine! "Let us eat and drink," you say, "for tomorrow we die!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The LORD Almighty has revealed this in my hearing: "Till your dying day this sin will not be atoned for," says the Lord, the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">This is what the Lord, the LORD Almighty, says: "Go, say to this steward, to Shebna, who is in charge of the palace:</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="17">"Beware, the LORD is about to take firm hold of you and hurl you away, O you mighty man.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="20">"In that day I will summon my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to those who live in Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will be a seat of honor for the house of his father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">All the glory of his family will hang on him: its offspring and offshoots-all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"In that day," declares the LORD Almighty, "the peg driven into the firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and will fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut down." The LORD has spoken.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
<VERS vnumber="1">An oracle concerning Tyre: Wail, O ships of Tarshish! For Tyre is destroyed and left without house or harbor. From the land of Cyprus word has come to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Be silent, you people of the island and you merchants of Sidon, whom the seafarers have enriched.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">On the great waters came the grain of the Shihor; the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre, and she became the marketplace of the nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Be ashamed, O Sidon, and you, O fortress of the sea, for the sea has spoken: "I have neither been in labor nor given birth; I have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When word comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report from Tyre.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Cross over to Tarshish; wail, you people of the island.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Is this your city of revelry, the old, old city, whose feet have taken her to settle in far-off lands?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are renowned in the earth?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The LORD Almighty planned it, to bring low the pride of all glory and to humble all who are renowned on the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Till your land as along the Nile, O Daughter of Tarshish, for you no longer have a harbor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The LORD has stretched out his hand over the sea and made its kingdoms tremble. He has given an order concerning Phoenicia that her fortresses be destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He said, "No more of your reveling, O Virgin Daughter of Sidon, now crushed! "Up, cross over to Cyprus; even there you will find no rest."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Look at the land of the Babylonians, this people that is now of no account! The Assyrians have made it a place for desert creatures; they raised up their siege towers, they stripped its fortresses bare and turned it into a ruin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Wail, you ships of Tarshish; your fortress is destroyed!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the span of a king's life. But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Take up a harp, walk through the city, O prostitute forgotten; play the harp well, sing many a song, so that you will be remembered."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">At the end of seventy years, the LORD will deal with Tyre. She will return to her hire as a prostitute and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the LORD; they will not be stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothes.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">See, the LORD is going to lay waste the earth and devastate it; he will ruin its face and scatter its inhabitants-</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">The earth will be completely laid waste and totally plundered. The LORD has spoken this word.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The earth dries up and withers, the world languishes and withers, the exalted of the earth languish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Therefore a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt. Therefore earth's inhabitants are burned up, and very few are left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The new wine dries up and the vine withers; all the merrymakers groan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The gaiety of the tambourines is stilled, the noise of the revelers has stopped, the joyful harp is silent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">No longer do they drink wine with a song; the beer is bitter to its drinkers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The ruined city lies desolate; the entrance to every house is barred.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">In the streets they cry out for wine; all joy turns to gloom, all gaiety is banished from the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The city is left in ruins, its gate is battered to pieces.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So will it be on the earth and among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They raise their voices, they shout for joy; from the west they acclaim the LORD's majesty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Therefore in the east give glory to the LORD; exalt the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">From the ends of the earth we hear singing: "Glory to the Righteous One." But I said, "I waste away, I waste away! Woe to me! The treacherous betray! With treachery the treacherous betray!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Terror and pit and snare await you, O people of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Whoever flees at the sound of terror will fall into a pit; whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare. The floodgates of the heavens are opened, the foundations of the earth shake.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The earth is broken up, the earth is split asunder, the earth is thoroughly shaken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The earth reels like a drunkard, it sways like a hut in the wind; so heavy upon it is the guilt of its rebellion that it falls-never to rise again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">In that day the LORD will punish the powers in the heavens above and the kings on the earth below.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">They will be herded together like prisoners bound in a dungeon; they will be shut up in prison and be punished after many days.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">O LORD, you are my God; I will exalt you and praise your name, for in perfect faithfulness you have done marvelous things, things planned long ago.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">You have made the city a heap of rubble, the fortified town a ruin, the foreigners' stronghold a city no more; it will never be rebuilt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Therefore strong peoples will honor you; cities of ruthless nations will revere you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">You have been a refuge for the poor, a refuge for the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like a storm driving against a wall</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">and like the heat of the desert. You silence the uproar of foreigners; as heat is reduced by the shadow of a cloud, so the song of the ruthless is stilled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">On this mountain the LORD Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine- the best of meats and the finest of wines.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">On this mountain he will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">he will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the tears from all faces; he will remove the disgrace of his people from all the earth. The LORD has spoken.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="10">The hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain; but Moab will be trampled under him as straw is trampled down in the manure.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">They will spread out their hands in it, as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim. God will bring down their pride despite the cleverness of their hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He will bring down your high fortified walls and lay them low; he will bring them down to the ground, to the very dust.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="9">By this, then, will Jacob's guilt be atoned for, and this will be the full fruitage of the removal of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones to be like chalk stones crushed to pieces, no Asherah poles or incense altars will be left standing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The fortified city stands desolate, an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the desert; there the calves graze, there they lie down; they strip its branches bare.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When its twigs are dry, they are broken off and women come and make fires with them. For this is a people without understanding; so their Maker has no compassion on them, and their Creator shows them no favor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">In that day the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, O Israelites, will be gathered up one by one.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">That wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, will be trampled underfoot.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">That fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley, will be like a fig ripe before harvest- as soon as someone sees it and takes it in his hand, he swallows it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">In that day the LORD Almighty will be a glorious crown, a beautiful wreath for the remnant of his people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He will be a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer: Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="9">"Who is it he is trying to teach? To whom is he explaining his message? To children weaned from their milk, to those just taken from the breast?</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="11">Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues God will speak to this people,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">to whom he said, "This is the resting place, let the weary rest"; and, "This is the place of repose"- but they would not listen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So then, the word of the LORD to them will become: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule; a little here, a little there- so that they will go and fall backward, be injured and snared and captured.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">You boast, "We have entered into a covenant with death, with the grave we have made an agreement. When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it cannot touch us, for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood our hiding place."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who trusts will never be dismayed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and water will overflow your hiding place.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="24">When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and harrowing the soil?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cummin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, barley in its plot, and spelt in its field?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">His God instructs him and teaches him the right way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a stick.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. Though he drives the wheels of his threshing cart over it, his horses do not grind it.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="8">as when a hungry man dreams that he is eating, but he awakens, and his hunger remains; as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking, but he awakens faint, with his thirst unquenched. So will it be with the hordes of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="10">The LORD has brought over you a deep sleep: He has sealed your eyes (the prophets); he has covered your heads (the seers).</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">For you this whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll. And if you give the scroll to someone who can read, and say to him, "Read this, please," he will answer, "I can't; it is sealed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Or if you give the scroll to someone who cannot read, and say, "Read this, please," he will answer, "I don't know how to read."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The Lord says: "These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="17">In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field and the fertile field seem like a forest?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Once more the humble will rejoice in the LORD; the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The ruthless will vanish, the mockers will disappear, and all who have an eye for evil will be cut down-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">those who with a word make a man out to be guilty, who ensnare the defender in court and with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="36">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The field commander said to them, "Tell Hezekiah, "'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">You say you have strategy and military strength-but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Look now, you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces a man's hand and wounds him if he leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And if you say to me, "We are depending on the LORD our God"-isn't he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar"?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"'Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses-if you can put riders on them!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master's officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this land without the LORD? The LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But the commander replied, "Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the men sitting on the wall-who, like you, will have to eat their own filth and drink their own urine?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, 'The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">until I come and take you to a land like your own-a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, 'The LORD will deliver us.' Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="20">Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, "Do not answer him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="37">
<VERS vnumber="1">When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the LORD.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">They told him, "This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the LORD your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When King Hezekiah's officials came to Isaiah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, 'This is what the LORD says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard-those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Listen! I am going to put a spirit in him so that when he hears a certain report, he will return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the Cushite king of Egypt, was marching out to fight against him. When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, 'Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver them-the gods of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivvah?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"O LORD Almighty, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Give ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"It is true, O LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Now, O LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone, O LORD, are God. "</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">this is the word the LORD has spoken against him: "The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises and mocks you. The Daughter of Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="24">By your messengers you have heaped insults on the Lord. And you have said, 'With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its pines. I have reached its remotest heights, the finest of its forests.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">I have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">"Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="29">Because you rage against me and because your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">"This will be the sign for you, O Hezekiah: "This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Once more a remnant of the house of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">"Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria: "He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="6">The idols among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion; they, they are your lot. Yes, to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings. In the light of these things, should I relent?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill; there you went up to offer your sacrifices.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Behind your doors and your doorposts you have put your pagan symbols. Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed, you climbed into it and opened it wide; you made a pact with those whose beds you love, and you looked on their nakedness.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="6">Their cobwebs are useless for clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are evil deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Their feet rush into sin; they are swift to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are evil thoughts; ruin and destruction mark their ways.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The way of peace they do not know; there is no justice in their paths. They have turned them into crooked roads; no one who walks in them will know peace.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="13">rebellion and treachery against the LORD, turning our backs on our God, fomenting oppression and revolt, uttering lies our hearts have conceived.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So justice is driven back, and righteousness stands at a distance; truth has stumbled in the streets, honesty cannot enter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey. The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He saw that there was no one, he was appalled that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm worked salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He put on righteousness as his breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on his head; he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="14">When you see this, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass; the hand of the LORD will be made known to his servants, but his fury will be shown to his foes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">See, the LORD is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">For with fire and with his sword the LORD will execute judgment upon all men, and many will be those slain by the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following the one in the midst of those who eat the flesh of pigs and rats and other abominable things-they will meet their end together," declares the LORD.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="19">"I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations-to Tarshish, to the Libyans and Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And they will bring all your brothers, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the LORD -on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels," says the LORD.

<VERS vnumber="4">The word of the LORD came to me, saying,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Ah, Sovereign LORD," I said, "I do not know how to speak; I am only a child."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am only a child.' You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you," declares the LORD.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="4">Have you not just called to me: 'My Father, my friend from my youth,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">"Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture!" declares the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Therefore this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to the shepherds who tend my people: "Because you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not bestowed care on them, I will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done," declares the LORD.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
<VERS vnumber="1">After Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the officials, the craftsmen and the artisans of Judah were carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the LORD showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the LORD.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
<VERS vnumber="1">The word came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those living in Jerusalem:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">For twenty-three years-from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day-the word of the LORD has come to me and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And though the LORD has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again, you have not listened or paid any attention.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">They said, "Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil practices, and you can stay in the land the LORD gave to you and your fathers for ever and ever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them; do not provoke me to anger with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"But you did not listen to me," declares the LORD, "and you have provoked me with what your hands have made, and you have brought harm to yourselves."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Therefore the LORD Almighty says this: "Because you have not listened to my words,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon," declares the LORD, "and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations. I will completely destroy them and make them an object of horror and scorn, and an everlasting ruin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"But when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation, the land of the Babylonians, for their guilt," declares the LORD, "and will make it desolate forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I will bring upon that land all the things I have spoken against it, all that are written in this book and prophesied by Jeremiah against all the nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings; I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: "Take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When they drink it, they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I will send among them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So I took the cup from the LORD's hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a ruin and an object of horror and scorn and cursing, as they are today;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Pharaoh king of Egypt, his attendants, his officials and all his people,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="26">and all the kings of the north, near and far, one after the other-all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshach will drink it too.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">"Then tell them, 'This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk and vomit, and fall to rise no more because of the sword I will send among you.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">But if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, tell them, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says: You must drink it!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">See, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears my Name, and will you indeed go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling down a sword upon all who live on the earth, declares the LORD Almighty.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">"Now prophesy all these words against them and say to them: "'The LORD will roar from on high; he will thunder from his holy dwelling and roar mightily against his land. He will shout like those who tread the grapes, shout against all who live on the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">The tumult will resound to the ends of the earth, for the LORD will bring charges against the nations; he will bring judgment on all mankind and put the wicked to the sword,'" declares the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Look! Disaster is spreading from nation to nation; a mighty storm is rising from the ends of the earth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">At that time those slain by the LORD will be everywhere-from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned or gathered up or buried, but will be like refuse lying on the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Weep and wail, you shepherds; roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock. For your time to be slaughtered has come; you will fall and be shattered like fine pottery.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="36">Hear the cry of the shepherds, the wailing of the leaders of the flock, for the LORD is destroying their pasture.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
<VERS vnumber="1">Early in the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came from the LORD:</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="7">The priests, the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speak these words in the house of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But as soon as Jeremiah finished telling all the people everything the LORD had commanded him to say, the priests, the prophets and all the people seized him and said, "You must die!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Why do you prophesy in the LORD's name that this house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate and deserted?" And all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When the officials of Judah heard about these things, they went up from the royal palace to the house of the LORD and took their places at the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD's house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people, "This man should be sentenced to death because he has prophesied against this city. You have heard it with your own ears!"</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="28">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people:</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="2">The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, "Why do you prophesy as you do? You say, 'This is what the LORD says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="10">I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the silver on the scales.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">I took the deed of purchase-the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed copy-</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="8">The word came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Everyone was to free his Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Jew in bondage.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your forefathers when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">'Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrew who has sold himself to you. After he has served you six years, you must let him go free.' Your fathers, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to his countrymen. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Therefore, this is what the LORD says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom for your fellow countrymen. So I now proclaim 'freedom' for you, declares the LORD -'freedom' to fall by the sword, plague and famine. I will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The men who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests and all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">I will hand over to their enemies who seek their lives. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"I will hand Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials over to their enemies who seek their lives, to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">I am going to give the order, declares the LORD, and I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, take it and burn it down. And I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there."</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="35">
<VERS vnumber="1">This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD during the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Go to the Recabite family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the house of the LORD and give them wine to drink."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons-the whole family of the Recabites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the room of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God. It was next to the room of the officials, which was over that of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the men of the Recabite family and said to them, "Drink some wine."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But they replied, "We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jonadab son of Recab gave us this command: 'Neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Also you must never build houses, sow seed or plant vineyards; you must never have any of these things, but must always live in tents. Then you will live a long time in the land where you are nomads.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">We have obeyed everything our forefather Jonadab son of Recab commanded us. Neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters have ever drunk wine</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">or built houses to live in or had vineyards, fields or crops.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything our forefather Jonadab commanded us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this land, we said, 'Come, we must go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian and Aramean armies.' So we have remained in Jerusalem."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem, 'Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words?' declares the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">'Jonadab son of Recab ordered his sons not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather's command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, "Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your fathers." But you have not paid attention or listened to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The descendants of Jonadab son of Recab have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not obeyed me.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Therefore, this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'Listen! I am going to bring on Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem every disaster I pronounced against them. I spoke to them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Recabites, "This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'You have obeyed the command of your forefather Jonadab and have followed all his instructions and have done everything he ordered.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Therefore, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'Jonadab son of Recab will never fail to have a man to serve me.'"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="36">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, each of them will turn from his wicked way; then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the LORD had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then Jeremiah told Baruch, "I am restricted; I cannot go to the LORD's temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So you go to the house of the LORD on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the LORD that you wrote as I dictated. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Perhaps they will bring their petition before the LORD, and each will turn from his wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the LORD are great."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the LORD's temple he read the words of the LORD from the scroll.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a time of fasting before the LORD was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the LORD's temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">he went down to the secretary's room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Acbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, "Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come." So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">They said to him, "Sit down, please, and read it to us." So Baruch read it to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, "We must report all these words to the king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then they asked Baruch, "Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"Yes," Baruch replied, "he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on the scroll."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then the officials said to Baruch, "You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don't let anyone know where you are."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe's knife and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the LORD had hidden them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">"Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, 'This is what the LORD says: You burned that scroll and said, "Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and cut off both men and animals from it?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Therefore, this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="37">
<VERS vnumber="1">Zedekiah son of Josiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; he reigned in place of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the LORD had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">King Zedekiah, however, sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message: "Please pray to the LORD our God for us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Pharaoh's army had marched out of Egypt, and when the Babylonians who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of me, 'Pharaoh's army, which has marched out to support you, will go back to its own land, to Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then the Babylonians will return and attack this city; they will capture it and burn it down.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"This is what the LORD says: Do not deceive yourselves, thinking, 'The Babylonians will surely leave us.' They will not!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian army that is attacking you and only wounded men were left in their tents, they would come out and burn this city down."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">After the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin to get his share of the property among the people there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But when he reached the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him and said, "You are deserting to the Babylonians!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"That's not true!" Jeremiah said. "I am not deserting to the Babylonians." But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they had made into a prison.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained a long time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace, where he asked him privately, "Is there any word from the LORD?Yes," Jeremiah replied, "you will be handed over to the king of Babylon."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, "What crime have I committed against you or your officials or this people, that you have put me in prison?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, 'The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land'?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">But now, my lord the king, please listen. Let me bring my petition before you: Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, or I will die there."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="38">
<VERS vnumber="1">Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people when he said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"This is what the LORD says: 'Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague, but whoever goes over to the Babylonians will live. He will escape with his life; he will live.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">And this is what the LORD says: 'This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the officials said to the king, "This man should be put to death. He is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, as well as all the people, by the things he is saying to them. This man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"He is in your hands," King Zedekiah answered. "The king can do nothing to oppose you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah, the king's son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern; it had no water in it, only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But Ebed-Melech, a Cushite, an official in the royal palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Ebed-Melech went out of the palace and said to him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern, where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech the Cushite, "Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Ebed-Melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, "Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes." Jeremiah did so,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the LORD. "I am going to ask you something," the king said to Jeremiah. "Do not hide anything from me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I give you an answer, will you not kill me? Even if I did give you counsel, you would not listen to me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah: "As surely as the LORD lives, who has given us breath, I will neither kill you nor hand you over to those who are seeking your life."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "This is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down; you and your family will live.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But if you will not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Babylonians and they will burn it down; you yourself will not escape from their hands.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Jews who have gone over to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians may hand me over to them and they will mistreat me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"They will not hand you over," Jeremiah replied. "Obey the LORD by doing what I tell you. Then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the LORD has revealed to me:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you: "'They misled you and overcame you- those trusted friends of yours. Your feet are sunk in the mud; your friends have deserted you.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians. You yourself will not escape from their hands but will be captured by the king of Babylon; and this city will be burned down."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Do not let anyone know about this conversation, or you may die.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">If the officials hear that I talked with you, and they come to you and say, 'Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us or we will kill you,'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">then tell them, 'I was pleading with the king not to send me back to Jonathan's house to die there.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">All the officials did come to Jeremiah and question him, and he told them everything the king had ordered him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had heard his conversation with the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="39">
<VERS vnumber="1">This is how Jerusalem was taken: In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah's eleventh year, the city wall was broken through.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and took seats in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officials of the king of Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled; they left the city at night by way of the king's garden, through the gate between the two walls, and headed toward the Arabah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But the Babylonian army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and also killed all the nobles of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then he put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The Babylonians set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard carried into exile to Babylon the people who remained in the city, along with those who had gone over to him, and the rest of the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people, who owned nothing; and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given these orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"Take him and look after him; don't harm him but do for him whatever he asks."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard, Nebushazban a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officers of the king of Babylon</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">sent and had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard. They turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him back to his home. So he remained among his own people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">While Jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD came to him:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Go and tell Ebed-Melech the Cushite, 'This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill my words against this city through disaster, not prosperity. At that time they will be fulfilled before your eyes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But I will rescue you on that day, declares the LORD; you will not be handed over to those you fear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">I will save you; you will not fall by the sword but will escape with your life, because you trust in me, declares the LORD.'"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="40">
<VERS vnumber="1">The word came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had released him at Ramah. He had found Jeremiah bound in chains among all the captives from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried into exile to Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">When the commander of the guard found Jeremiah, he said to him, "The LORD your God decreed this disaster for this place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">And now the LORD has brought it about; he has done just as he said he would. All this happened because you people sinned against the LORD and did not obey him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But today I am freeing you from the chains on your wrists. Come with me to Babylon, if you like, and I will look after you; but if you do not want to, then don't come. Look, the whole country lies before you; go wherever you please."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">However, before Jeremiah turned to go, Nebuzaradan added, "Go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns of Judah, and live with him among the people, or go anywhere else you please." Then the commander gave him provisions and a present and let him go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the land and had put him in charge of the men, women and children who were the poorest in the land and who had not been carried into exile to Babylon,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah-Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, and their men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath to reassure them and their men. "Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians, "he said. "Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">I myself will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to us, but you are to harvest the wine, summer fruit and oil, and put them in your storage jars, and live in the towns you have taken over."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When all the Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom and all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as governor over them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">they all came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, from all the countries where they had been scattered. And they harvested an abundance of wine and summer fruit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">and said to him, "Don't you know that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?" But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Johanan son of Kareah said privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah, "Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life and cause all the Jews who are gathered around you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, "Don't do such a thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="41">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood and had been one of the king's officers, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating together there,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Babylonian soldiers who were there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The day after Gedaliah's assassination, before anyone knew about it,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">eighty men who had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes and cut themselves came from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria, bringing grain offerings and incense with them to the house of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, "Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When they went into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But ten of them said to Ishmael, "Don't kill us! We have wheat and barley, oil and honey, hidden in a field." So he let them alone and did not kill them with the others.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had made as part of his defense against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Ishmael made captives of all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah-the king's daughters along with all the others who were left there, over whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the crimes Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the great pool in Gibeon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">When all the people Ishmael had with him saw Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers who were with him, they were glad.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">All the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and fled to the Ammonites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led away all the survivors from Mizpah whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after he had assassinated Gedaliah son of Ahikam: the soldiers, women, children and court officials he had brought from Gibeon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">And they went on, stopping at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem on their way to Egypt</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">to escape the Babylonians. They were afraid of them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="42">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then all the army officers, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest approached</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Jeremiah the prophet and said to him, "Please hear our petition and pray to the LORD your God for this entire remnant. For as you now see, though we were once many, now only a few are left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Pray that the LORD your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"I have heard you," replied Jeremiah the prophet. "I will certainly pray to the LORD your God as you have requested; I will tell you everything the LORD says and will keep nothing back from you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then they said to Jeremiah, "May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the LORD your God sends you to tell us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Whether it is favorable or unfavorable, we will obey the LORD our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it will go well with us, for we will obey the LORD our God."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Ten days later the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So he called together Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition, says:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">'If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I am grieved over the disaster I have inflicted on you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him, declares the LORD, for I am with you and will save you and deliver you from his hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">I will show you compassion so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your land.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"However, if you say, 'We will not stay in this land,' and so disobey the LORD your God,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">and if you say, 'No, we will go and live in Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the trumpet or be hungry for bread,'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">then hear the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'If you are determined to go to Egypt and you do go to settle there,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow you into Egypt, and there you will die.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Indeed, all who are determined to go to Egypt to settle there will die by the sword, famine and plague; not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'As my anger and wrath have been poured out on those who lived in Jerusalem, so will my wrath be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You will be an object of cursing and horror, of condemnation and reproach; you will never see this place again.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"O remnant of Judah, the LORD has told you, 'Do not go to Egypt.' Be sure of this: I warn you today</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">that you made a fatal mistake when you sent me to the LORD your God and said, 'Pray to the LORD our God for us; tell us everything he says and we will do it.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">I have told you today, but you still have not obeyed the LORD your God in all he sent me to tell you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So now, be sure of this: You will die by the sword, famine and plague in the place where you want to go to settle."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="43">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Jeremiah finished telling the people all the words of the LORD their God-everything the LORD had sent him to tell them-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, "You are lying! The LORD our God has not sent you to say, 'You must not go to Egypt to settle there.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Babylonians, so they may kill us or carry us into exile to Babylon."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed the LORD's command to stay in the land of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led away all the remnant of Judah who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">They also led away all the men, women and children and the king's daughters whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So they entered Egypt in disobedience to the LORD and went as far as Tahpanhes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">In Tahpanhes the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"While the Jews are watching, take some large stones with you and bury them in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then say to them, 'This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here; he will spread his royal canopy above them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He will come and attack Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn their temples and take their gods captive. As a shepherd wraps his garment around him, so will he wrap Egypt around himself and depart from there unscathed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">There in the temple of the sun in Egypt he will demolish the sacred pillars and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.'"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="44">
<VERS vnumber="1">This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt-in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis -and in Upper Egypt:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">because of the evil they have done. They provoked me to anger by burning incense and by worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your fathers ever knew.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, 'Do not do this detestable thing that I hate!'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Now this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why bring such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women, the children and infants, and so leave yourselves without a remnant?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Why provoke me to anger with what your hands have made, burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves an object of cursing and reproach among all the nations on earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your fathers and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Therefore, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or die from famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine. They will become an object of cursing and horror, of condemnation and reproach.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine and plague, as I punished Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and live; none will return except a few fugitives."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present-a large assembly-and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt, said to Jeremiah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our fathers, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The women added, "When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did not our husbands know that we were making cakes like her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"Did not the LORD remember and think about the incense burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your fathers, your kings and your officials and the people of the land?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">When the LORD could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did, your land became an object of cursing and a desolate waste without inhabitants, as it is today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations, this disaster has come upon you, as you now see."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah in Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have shown by your actions what you promised when you said, 'We will certainly carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven.'"Go ahead then, do what you promised! Keep your vows!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">But hear the word of the LORD, all Jews living in Egypt: 'I swear by my great name,' says the LORD, 'that no one from Judah living anywhere in Egypt will ever again invoke my name or swear, "As surely as the Sovereign LORD lives."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">For I am watching over them for harm, not for good; the Jews in Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Those who escape the sword and return to the land of Judah from Egypt will be very few. Then the whole remnant of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know whose word will stand-mine or theirs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">"'This will be the sign to you that I will punish you in this place,' declares the LORD, 'so that you will know that my threats of harm against you will surely stand.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">This is what the LORD says: 'I am going to hand Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt over to his enemies who seek his life, just as I handed Zedekiah king of Judah over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the enemy who was seeking his life.'"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="45">
<VERS vnumber="1">This is what Jeremiah the prophet told Baruch son of Neriah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, after Baruch had written on a scroll the words Jeremiah was then dictating:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">You said, 'Woe to me! The LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The LORD said, "Say this to him: 'This is what the LORD says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Should you then seek great things for yourself? Seek them not. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the LORD, but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life.'"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="46">
<VERS vnumber="1">This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Concerning Egypt: This is the message against the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"Prepare your shields, both large and small, and march out for battle!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Harness the horses, mount the steeds! Take your positions with helmets on! Polish your spears, put on your armor!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">What do I see? They are terrified, they are retreating, their warriors are defeated. They flee in haste without looking back, and there is terror on every side," declares the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"The swift cannot flee nor the strong escape. In the north by the River Euphrates they stumble and fall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Who is this that rises like the Nile, like rivers of surging waters?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Egypt rises like the Nile, like rivers of surging waters. She says, 'I will rise and cover the earth; I will destroy cities and their people.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Charge, O horses! Drive furiously, O charioteers! March on, O warriors- men of Cush and Put who carry shields, men of Lydia who draw the bow.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But that day belongs to the LORD, the Lord Almighty- a day of vengeance, for vengeance on his foes. The sword will devour till it is satisfied, till it has quenched its thirst with blood. For the Lord, the LORD Almighty, will offer sacrifice in the land of the north by the River Euphrates.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Go up to Gilead and get balm, O Virgin Daughter of Egypt. But you multiply remedies in vain; there is no healing for you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The nations will hear of your shame; your cries will fill the earth. One warrior will stumble over another; both will fall down together."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">This is the message the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to attack Egypt:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"Announce this in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol; proclaim it also in Memphis and Tahpanhes: 'Take your positions and get ready, for the sword devours those around you.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Why will your warriors be laid low? They cannot stand, for the LORD will push them down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">They will stumble repeatedly; they will fall over each other. They will say, 'Get up, let us go back to our own people and our native lands, away from the sword of the oppressor.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">There they will exclaim, 'Pharaoh king of Egypt is only a loud noise; he has missed his opportunity.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"As surely as I live," declares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty, "one will come who is like Tabor among the mountains, like Carmel by the sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Pack your belongings for exile, you who live in Egypt, for Memphis will be laid waste and lie in ruins without inhabitant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"Egypt is a beautiful heifer, but a gadfly is coming against her from the north.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The mercenaries in her ranks are like fattened calves. They too will turn and flee together, they will not stand their ground, for the day of disaster is coming upon them, the time for them to be punished.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Egypt will hiss like a fleeing serpent as the enemy advances in force; they will come against her with axes, like men who cut down trees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">They will chop down her forest," declares the LORD, "dense though it be. They are more numerous than locusts, they cannot be counted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The Daughter of Egypt will be put to shame, handed over to the people of the north."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "I am about to bring punishment on Amon god of Thebes, on Pharaoh, on Egypt and her gods and her kings, and on those who rely on Pharaoh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">I will hand them over to those who seek their lives, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. Later, however, Egypt will be inhabited as in times past," declares the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">"Do not fear, O Jacob my servant; do not be dismayed, O Israel. I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Do not fear, O Jacob my servant, for I am with you," declares the LORD. "Though I completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you, I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you but only with justice; I will not let you go entirely unpunished."</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="47">
<VERS vnumber="1">This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked Gaza:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">This is what the LORD says: "See how the waters are rising in the north; they will become an overflowing torrent. They will overflow the land and everything in it, the towns and those who live in them. The people will cry out; all who dwell in the land will wail</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">at the sound of the hoofs of galloping steeds, at the noise of enemy chariots and the rumble of their wheels. Fathers will not turn to help their children; their hands will hang limp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">For the day has come to destroy all the Philistines and to cut off all survivors who could help Tyre and Sidon. The LORD is about to destroy the Philistines, the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Gaza will shave her head in mourning; Ashkelon will be silenced. O remnant on the plain, how long will you cut yourselves?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"'Ah, sword of the LORD,' you cry, 'how long till you rest? Return to your scabbard; cease and be still.'</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="48">
<VERS vnumber="1">Concerning Moab: This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "Woe to Nebo, for it will be ruined. Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured; the stronghold will be disgraced and shattered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Moab will be praised no more; in Heshbon men will plot her downfall: 'Come, let us put an end to that nation.' You too, O Madmen, will be silenced; the sword will pursue you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Listen to the cries from Horonaim, cries of great havoc and destruction.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Moab will be broken; her little ones will cry out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">They go up the way to Luhith, weeping bitterly as they go; on the road down to Horonaim anguished cries over the destruction are heard.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Flee! Run for your lives; become like a bush in the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Since you trust in your deeds and riches, you too will be taken captive, and Chemosh will go into exile, together with his priests and officials.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The destroyer will come against every town, and not a town will escape. The valley will be ruined and the plateau destroyed, because the LORD has spoken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Put salt on Moab, for she will be laid waste; her towns will become desolate, with no one to live in them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"A curse on him who is lax in doing the LORD's work! A curse on him who keeps his sword from bloodshed!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Moab has been at rest from youth, like wine left on its dregs, not poured from one jar to another- she has not gone into exile. So she tastes as she did, and her aroma is unchanged.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will send men who pour from jars, and they will pour her out; they will empty her jars and smash her jugs.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">"Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is destroyed! Cry out, O inhabitants of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth and mourn; rush here and there inside the walls, for Molech will go into exile, together with his priests and officials.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Why do you boast of your valleys, boast of your valleys so fruitful? O unfaithful daughter, you trust in your riches and say, 'Who will attack me?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I will bring terror on you from all those around you," declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty. "Every one of you will be driven away, and no one will gather the fugitives.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="52">
<VERS vnumber="1">Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">It was because of the LORD's anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence. Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So in the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They camped outside the city and built siege works all around it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled. They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the king's garden, though the Babylonians were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">but the Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">and he was captured. He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he also killed all the officials of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then he put out Zedekiah's eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon, where he put him in prison till the day of his death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He set fire to the temple of the LORD, the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The whole Babylonian army under the commander of the imperial guard broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="16">But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the LORD and they carried all the bronze to Babylon.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="19">The commander of the imperial guard took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands, dishes and bowls used for drink offerings-all that were made of pure gold or silver.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the temple of the LORD, was more than could be weighed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Each of the pillars was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference; each was four fingers thick, and hollow.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The bronze capital on top of the one pillar was five cubits high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its pomegranates, was similar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; the total number of pomegranates above the surrounding network was a hundred.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Of those still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men, and seven royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land and sixty of his men who were found in the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed. So Judah went into captivity, away from her land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">This is the number of the people Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">in Nebuchadnezzar's eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">in his twenty-third year, 745 Jews taken into exile by Nebuzaradan the commander of the imperial guard. There were 4,600 people in all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year Evil-Merodach became king of Babylon, he released Jehoiachin king of Judah and freed him from prison on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king's table.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Day by day the king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived, till the day of his death.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="2">Without pity the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob; in his wrath he has torn down the strongholds of the Daughter of Judah. He has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">In fierce anger he has cut off every horn of Israel. He has withdrawn his right hand at the approach of the enemy. He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Like an enemy he has strung his bow; his right hand is ready. Like a foe he has slain all who were pleasing to the eye; he has poured out his wrath like fire on the tent of the Daughter of Zion.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The Lord is like an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for the Daughter of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden; he has destroyed his place of meeting. The LORD has made Zion forget her appointed feasts and her Sabbaths; in his fierce anger he has spurned both king and priest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The Lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his sanctuary. He has handed over to the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have raised a shout in the house of the LORD as on the day of an appointed feast.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The LORD determined to tear down the wall around the Daughter of Zion. He stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying. He made ramparts and walls lament; together they wasted away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Her gates have sunk into the ground; their bars he has broken and destroyed. Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations, the law is no more, and her prophets no longer find visions from the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The elders of the Daughter of Zion sit on the ground in silence; they have sprinkled dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">My eyes fail from weeping, I am in torment within, my heart is poured out on the ground because my people are destroyed, because children and infants faint in the streets of the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They say to their mothers, "Where is bread and wine?" as they faint like wounded men in the streets of the city, as their lives ebb away in their mothers' arms.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">What can I say for you? With what can I compare you, O Daughter of Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, that I may comfort you, O Virgin Daughter of Zion? Your wound is as deep as the sea. Who can heal you?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The visions of your prophets were false and worthless; they did not expose your sin to ward off your captivity. The oracles they gave you were false and misleading.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">All who pass your way clap their hands at you; they scoff and shake their heads at the Daughter of Jerusalem: "Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">All your enemies open their mouths wide against you; they scoff and gnash their teeth and say, "We have swallowed her up. This is the day we have waited for; we have lived to see it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The LORD has done what he planned; he has fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown you without pity, he has let the enemy gloat over you, he has exalted the horn of your foes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The hearts of the people cry out to the Lord. O wall of the Daughter of Zion, let your tears flow like a river day and night; give yourself no relief, your eyes no rest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Arise, cry out in the night, as the watches of the night begin; pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord. Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint from hunger at the head of every street.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"Look, O LORD, and consider: Whom have you ever treated like this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets; my young men and maidens have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered them without pity.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"As you summon to a feast day, so you summoned against me terrors on every side. In the day of the LORD's anger no one escaped or survived; those I cared for and reared, my enemy has destroyed."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness rather than light;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">indeed, he has turned his hand against me again and again, all day long.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He has made my skin and my flesh grow old and has broken my bones.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He has walled me in so I cannot escape; he has weighed me down with chains.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Even when I call out or cry for help, he shuts out my prayer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He has barred my way with blocks of stone; he has made my paths crooked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Like a bear lying in wait, like a lion in hiding,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">he dragged me from the path and mangled me and left me without help.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He pierced my heart with arrows from his quiver.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">I became the laughingstock of all my people; they mock me in song all day long.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He has filled me with bitter herbs and sated me with gall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He has broken my teeth with gravel; he has trampled me in the dust.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I have been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">So I say, "My splendor is gone and all that I had hoped from the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">I remember my affliction and my wandering, the bitterness and the gall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">I well remember them, and my soul is downcast within me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">I say to myself, "The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Let him sit alone in silence, for the LORD has laid it on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Let him bury his face in the dust- there may yet be hope.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him, and let him be filled with disgrace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">For men are not cast off by the Lord forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to the children of men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">to deny a man his rights before the Most High,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">to deprive a man of justice- would not the Lord see such things?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">Why should any living man complain when punished for his sins?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven, and say:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">"We have sinned and rebelled and you have not forgiven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">"You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us; you have slain without pity.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">You have made us scum and refuse among the nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">"All our enemies have opened their mouths wide against us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">We have suffered terror and pitfalls, ruin and destruction."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">My eyes will flow unceasingly, without relief,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="52">Those who were my enemies without cause hunted me like a bird.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="53">They tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="54">the waters closed over my head, and I thought I was about to be cut off.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="55">I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="56">You heard my plea: "Do not close your ears to my cry for relief."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="57">You came near when I called you, and you said, "Do not fear."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="58">O Lord, you took up my case; you redeemed my life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="59">You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me. Uphold my cause!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="60">You have seen the depth of their vengeance, all their plots against me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="61">O LORD, you have heard their insults, all their plots against me-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="62">what my enemies whisper and mutter against me all day long.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="63">Look at them! Sitting or standing, they mock me in their songs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="64">Pay them back what they deserve, O LORD, for what their hands have done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="65">Put a veil over their hearts, and may your curse be on them!</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">How the gold has lost its luster, the fine gold become dull! The sacred gems are scattered at the head of every street.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">How the precious sons of Zion, once worth their weight in gold, are now considered as pots of clay, the work of a potter's hands!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but my people have become heartless like ostriches in the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Because of thirst the infant's tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth; the children beg for bread, but no one gives it to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets. Those nurtured in purple now lie on ash heaps.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The punishment of my people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment without a hand turned to help her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Their princes were brighter than snow and whiter than milk, their bodies more ruddy than rubies, their appearance like sapphires.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But now they are blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as a stick.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Those killed by the sword are better off than those who die of famine; racked with hunger, they waste away for lack of food from the field.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">With their own hands compassionate women have cooked their own children, who became their food when my people were destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The LORD has given full vent to his wrath; he has poured out his fierce anger. He kindled a fire in Zion that consumed her foundations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did any of the world's people, that enemies and foes could enter the gates of Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But it happened because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed within her the blood of the righteous.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Now they grope through the streets like men who are blind. They are so defiled with blood that no one dares to touch their garments.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"Go away! You are unclean!" men cry to them. "Away! Away! Don't touch us!" When they flee and wander about, people among the nations say, "They can stay here no longer."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The LORD himself has scattered them; he no longer watches over them. The priests are shown no honor, the elders no favor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Moreover, our eyes failed, looking in vain for help; from our towers we watched for a nation that could not save us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Men stalked us at every step, so we could not walk in our streets. Our end was near, our days were numbered, for our end had come.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the sky; they chased us over the mountains and lay in wait for us in the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The LORD's anointed, our very life breath, was caught in their traps. We thought that under his shadow we would live among the nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Rejoice and be glad, O Daughter of Edom, you who live in the land of Uz. But to you also the cup will be passed; you will be drunk and stripped naked.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us; look, and see our disgrace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Our inheritance has been turned over to aliens, our homes to foreigners.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="4">We must buy the water we drink; our wood can be had only at a price.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Those who pursue us are at our heels; we are weary and find no rest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Our fathers sinned and are no more, and we bear their punishment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Slaves rule over us, and there is none to free us from their hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Our skin is hot as an oven, feverish from hunger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Women have been ravished in Zion, and virgins in the towns of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Princes have been hung up by their hands; elders are shown no respect.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Young men toil at the millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The elders are gone from the city gate; the young men have stopped their music.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Joy is gone from our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Because of this our hearts are faint, because of these things our eyes grow dim</VERS>

<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="26" bname="Ezekiel" bsname="Ezek">
<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">On the fifth of the month-it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. There the hand of the LORD was upon him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north-an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">but each of them had four faces and four wings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about as the creatures went.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">He said to me, "Son of man, stand up on your feet and I will speak to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He said: "Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their fathers have been in revolt against me to this very day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">And whether they listen or fail to listen-for they are a rebellious house-they will know that a prophet has been among them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">And he said to me, "Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the house of Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then he said to me, "Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it." So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He then said to me: "Son of man, go now to the house of Israel and speak my words to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and difficult language, but to the house of Israel-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">not to many peoples of obscure speech and difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But the house of Israel is not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for the whole house of Israel is hardened and obstinate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious house."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And he said to me, "Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Go now to your countrymen in exile and speak to them. Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says,' whether they listen or fail to listen."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound-May the glory of the LORD be praised in his dwelling place!-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the LORD upon me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Abib near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days-overwhelmed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When I say to a wicked man, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak out to dissuade him from his evil ways in order to save his life, that wicked man will die for his sin, and I will hold you accountable for his blood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">But if you do warn the wicked man and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his evil ways, he will die for his sin; but you will have saved yourself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before him, he will die. Since you did not warn him, he will die for his sin. The righteous things he did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for his blood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But if you do warn the righteous man not to sin and he does not sin, he will surely live because he took warning, and you will have saved yourself."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The hand of the LORD was upon me there, and he said to me, "Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: "Go, shut yourself inside your house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, though they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says.' Whoever will listen let him listen, and whoever will refuse let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">"Now, son of man, take a clay tablet, put it in front of you and draw the city of Jerusalem on it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then lay siege to it: Erect siege works against it, build a ramp up to it, set up camps against it and put battering rams around it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then take an iron pan, place it as an iron wall between you and the city and turn your face toward it. It will be under siege, and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the house of Israel upon yourself. You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin. So for 390 days you will bear the sin of the house of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"After you have finished this, lie down again, this time on your right side, and bear the sin of the house of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">I will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the 390 days you lie on your side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Weigh out twenty shekels of food to eat each day and eat it at set times.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Also measure out a sixth of a hin of water and drink it at set times.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Eat the food as you would a barley cake; bake it in the sight of the people, using human excrement for fuel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The LORD said, "In this way the people of Israel will eat defiled food among the nations where I will drive them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then I said, "Not so, Sovereign LORD! I have never defiled myself. From my youth until now I have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals. No unclean meat has ever entered my mouth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"Very well," he said, "I will let you bake your bread over cow manure instead of human excrement."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He then said to me: "Son of man, I will cut off the supply of food in Jerusalem. The people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed water in despair,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">for food and water will be scarce. They will be appalled at the sight of each other and will waste away because of their sin.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="2">When the days of your siege come to an end, burn a third of the hair with fire inside the city. Take a third and strike it with the sword all around the city. And scatter a third to the wind. For I will pursue them with drawn sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But take a few strands of hair and tuck them away in the folds of your garment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Again, take a few of these and throw them into the fire and burn them up. A fire will spread from there to the whole house of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: This is Jerusalem, which I have set in the center of the nations, with countries all around her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Yet in her wickedness she has rebelled against my laws and decrees more than the nations and countries around her. She has rejected my laws and has not followed my decrees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: You have been more unruly than the nations around you and have not followed my decrees or kept my laws. You have not even conformed to the standards of the nations around you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself am against you, Jerusalem, and I will inflict punishment on you in the sight of the nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Because of all your detestable idols, I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Therefore in your midst fathers will eat their children, and children will eat their fathers. I will inflict punishment on you and will scatter all your survivors to the winds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your vile images and detestable practices, I myself will withdraw my favor; I will not look on you with pity or spare you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">A third of your people will die of the plague or perish by famine inside you; a third will fall by the sword outside your walls; and a third I will scatter to the winds and pursue with drawn sword.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="14">"I will make you a ruin and a reproach among the nations around you, in the sight of all who pass by.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">You will be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and an object of horror to the nations around you when I inflict punishment on you in anger and in wrath and with stinging rebuke. I the LORD have spoken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When I shoot at you with my deadly and destructive arrows of famine, I will shoot to destroy you. I will bring more and more famine upon you and cut off your supply of food.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">The word of the LORD came to me:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Son of man, set your face against the mountains of Israel; prophesy against them</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and say: 'O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign LORD. This is what the Sovereign LORD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Your altars will be demolished and your incense altars will be smashed; and I will slay your people in front of your idols.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I will lay the dead bodies of the Israelites in front of their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Wherever you live, the towns will be laid waste and the high places demolished, so that your altars will be laid waste and devastated, your idols smashed and ruined, your incense altars broken down, and what you have made wiped out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Your people will fall slain among you, and you will know that I am the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"'But I will spare some, for some of you will escape the sword when you are scattered among the lands and nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then in the nations where they have been carried captive, those who escape will remember me-how I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts, which have turned away from me, and by their eyes, which have lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their detestable practices.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="13">And they will know that I am the LORD, when their people lie slain among their idols around their altars, on every high hill and on all the mountaintops, under every spreading tree and every leafy oak-places where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="13">The seller will not recover the land he has sold as long as both of them live, for the vision concerning the whole crowd will not be reversed. Because of their sins, not one of them will preserve his life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Though they blow the trumpet and get everything ready, no one will go into battle, for my wrath is upon the whole crowd.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"Outside is the sword, inside are plague and famine; those in the country will die by the sword, and those in the city will be devoured by famine and plague.</VERS>

</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the sixth year, in the sixth month on the fifth day, while I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, the hand of the Sovereign LORD came upon me there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man. From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance to the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel, as in the vision I had seen in the plain.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then he said to me, "Son of man, look toward the north." So I looked, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">And he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing-the utterly detestable things the house of Israel is doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in the wall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He said to me, "Son of man, now dig into the wall." So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">And he said to me, "Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and detestable animals and all the idols of the house of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">In front of them stood seventy elders of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He said to me, "Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? They say, 'The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the land.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Again, he said, "You will see them doing things that are even more detestable."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then he brought me to the entrance to the north gate of the house of the LORD, and I saw women sitting there, mourning for Tammuz.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He said to me, "Do you see this, son of man? You will see things that are even more detestable than this."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD, and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men. With their backs toward the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east, they were bowing down to the sun in the east.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He said to me, "Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the house of Judah to do the detestable things they are doing here? Must they also fill the land with violence and continually provoke me to anger? Look at them putting the branch to their nose!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Therefore I will deal with them in anger; I will not look on them with pity or spare them. Although they shout in my ears, I will not listen to them."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then I heard him call out in a loud voice, "Bring the guards of the city here, each with a weapon in his hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside the bronze altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then the LORD called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">and said to him, "Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">As I listened, he said to the others, "Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity or compassion.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Slaughter old men, young men and maidens, women and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary." So they began with the elders who were in front of the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then he said to them, "Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!" So they went out and began killing throughout the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">While they were killing and I was left alone, I fell facedown, crying out, "Ah, Sovereign LORD! Are you going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel in this outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He answered me, "The sin of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is full of bloodshed and the city is full of injustice. They say, 'The LORD has forsaken the land; the LORD does not see.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So I will not look on them with pity or spare them, but I will bring down on their own heads what they have done."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then the man in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back word, saying, "I have done as you commanded."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">I looked, and I saw the likeness of a throne of sapphire above the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The LORD said to the man clothed in linen, "Go in among the wheels beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city." And as I watched, he went in.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the glory of the LORD rose from above the cherubim and moved to the threshold of the temple. The cloud filled the temple, and the court was full of the radiance of the glory of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far away as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When the LORD commanded the man in linen, "Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim," the man went in and stood beside a wheel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took up some of it and put it into the hands of the man in linen, who took it and went out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">(Under the wings of the cherubim could be seen what looked like the hands of a man.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I looked, and I saw beside the cherubim four wheels, one beside each of the cherubim; the wheels sparkled like chrysolite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">As for their appearance, the four of them looked alike; each was like a wheel intersecting a wheel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the cherubim faced; the wheels did not turn about as the cherubim went. The cherubim went in whatever direction the head faced, without turning as they went.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Their entire bodies, including their backs, their hands and their wings, were completely full of eyes, as were their four wheels.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I heard the wheels being called "the whirling wheels."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Each of the cherubim had four faces: One face was that of a cherub, the second the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When the cherubim moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not leave their side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When the cherubim stood still, they also stood still; and when the cherubim rose, they rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then the glory of the LORD departed from over the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">While I watched, the cherubim spread their wings and rose from the ground, and as they went, the wheels went with them. They stopped at the entrance to the east gate of the LORD 's house, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the Kebar River, and I realized that they were cherubim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Each had four faces and four wings, and under their wings was what looked like the hands of a man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Their faces had the same appearance as those I had seen by the Kebar River. Each one went straight ahead.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the LORD that faces east. There at the entrance to the gate were twenty-five men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The LORD said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">They say, 'Will it not soon be time to build houses? This city is a cooking pot, and we are the meat.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon me, and he told me to say: "This is what the LORD says: That is what you are saying, O house of Israel, but I know what is going through your mind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: The bodies you have thrown there are the meat and this city is the pot, but I will drive you out of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">You fear the sword, and the sword is what I will bring against you, declares the Sovereign LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I will drive you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners and inflict punishment on you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">You will fall by the sword, and I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat in it; I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">And you will know that I am the LORD, for you have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, "Ah, Sovereign LORD! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The word of the LORD came to me:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"Son of man, your brothers-your brothers who are your blood relatives and the whole house of Israel-are those of whom the people of Jerusalem have said, 'They are far away from the LORD; this land was given to us as our possession.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Therefore say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Therefore say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel again.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The glory of the LORD went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Babylonia in the vision given by the Spirit of God. Then the vision I had seen went up from me,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">and I told the exiles everything the LORD had shown me.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
<VERS vnumber="1">The word of the LORD came to me:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Son of man, you are living among a rebellious people. They have eyes to see but do not see and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"Therefore, son of man, pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime, as they watch, set out and go from where you are to another place. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">During the daytime, while they watch, bring out your belongings packed for exile. Then in the evening, while they are watching, go out like those who go into exile.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">While they watch, dig through the wall and take your belongings out through it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Put them on your shoulder as they are watching and carry them out at dusk. Cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So I did as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my things packed for exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I took my belongings out at dusk, carrying them on my shoulders while they watched.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">In the morning the word of the LORD came to me:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Son of man, did not that rebellious house of Israel ask you, 'What are you doing?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: This oracle concerns the prince in Jerusalem and the whole house of Israel who are there.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Say to them, 'I am a sign to you.'"As I have done, so it will be done to them. They will go into exile as captives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"The prince among them will put his things on his shoulder at dusk and leave, and a hole will be dug in the wall for him to go through. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare; I will bring him to Babylonia, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and there he will die.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">I will scatter to the winds all those around him-his staff and all his troops-and I will pursue them with drawn sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"They will know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine and plague, so that in the nations where they go they may acknowledge all their detestable practices. Then they will know that I am the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The word of the LORD came to me:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"Son of man, tremble as you eat your food, and shudder in fear as you drink your water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Say to the people of the land: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says about those living in Jerusalem and in the land of Israel: They will eat their food in anxiety and drink their water in despair, for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The inhabited towns will be laid waste and the land will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The word of the LORD came to me:</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="23">Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am going to put an end to this proverb, and they will no longer quote it in Israel.' Say to them, 'The days are near when every vision will be fulfilled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">For there will be no more false visions or flattering divinations among the people of Israel.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="26">The word of the LORD came to me:</VERS>

</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
<VERS vnumber="1">The word of the LORD came to me:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: 'Hear the word of the LORD!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Your prophets, O Israel, are like jackals among ruins.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">You have not gone up to the breaks in the wall to repair it for the house of Israel so that it will stand firm in the battle on the day of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Their visions are false and their divinations a lie. They say, "The LORD declares," when the LORD has not sent them; yet they expect their words to be fulfilled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Have you not seen false visions and uttered lying divinations when you say, "The LORD declares," though I have not spoken?</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="10">"'Because they lead my people astray, saying, "Peace," when there is no peace, and because, when a flimsy wall is built, they cover it with whitewash,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. In that land their breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The older was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; and she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians-warriors</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, and mounted horsemen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">She gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when during her youth men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Therefore I handed her over to her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she lusted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters and killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women, and punishment was inflicted on her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">She too lusted after the Assyrians-governors and commanders, warriors in full dress, mounted horsemen, all handsome young men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"But she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed on a wall, figures of Chaldeans portrayed in red,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side-</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="24">They will come against you with weapons, chariots and wagons and with a throng of people; they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over to them for punishment, and they will punish you according to their standards.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those of you who are left will fall by the sword.

<VERS vnumber="38">They have also done this to me: At that same time they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">"They even sent messengers for men who came from far away, and when they arrived you bathed yourself for them, painted your eyes and put on your jewelry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">You sat on an elegant couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed the incense and oil that belonged to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">"The noise of a carefree crowd was around her; Sabeans were brought from the desert along with men from the rabble, and they put bracelets on the arms of the woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">Then I said about the one worn out by adultery, 'Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">And they slept with her. As men sleep with a prostitute, so they slept with those lewd women, Oholah and Oholibah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">But righteous men will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood, because they are adulterous and blood is on their hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Bring a mob against them and give them over to terror and plunder.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">The mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">"So I will put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not imitate you.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">On the mountains of Israel you will fall, you and all your troops and the nations with you. I will give you as food to all kinds of carrion birds and to the wild animals.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">You will fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in safety in the coastlands, and they will know that I am the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"'I will make known my holy name among my people Israel. I will no longer let my holy name be profaned, and the nations will know that I the LORD am the Holy One in Israel.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="10">They will not need to gather wood from the fields or cut it from the forests, because they will use the weapons for fuel. And they will plunder those who plundered them and loot those who looted them, declares the Sovereign LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"'On that day I will give Gog a burial place in Israel, in the valley of those who travel east toward the Sea. It will block the way of travelers, because Gog and all his hordes will be buried there. So it will be called the Valley of Hamon Gog.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="17">"Son of man, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Call out to every kind of bird and all the wild animals: 'Assemble and come together from all around to the sacrifice I am preparing for you, the great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel.

<VERS vnumber="29">I will no longer hide my face from them, for I will pour out my Spirit on the house of Israel, declares the Sovereign LORD."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="40">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the fall of the city-on that very day the hand of the LORD was upon me and he took me there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He took me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze; he was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The man said to me, "Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been brought here. Tell the house of Israel everything you see."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I saw a wall completely surrounding the temple area. The length of the measuring rod in the man's hand was six long cubits, each of which was a cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the wall; it was one measuring rod thick and one rod high.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then he went to the gate facing east. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold of the gate; it was one rod deep.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The alcoves for the guards were one rod long and one rod wide, and the projecting walls between the alcoves were five cubits thick. And the threshold of the gate next to the portico facing the temple was one rod deep.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then he measured the portico of the gateway;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">it was eight cubits deep and its jambs were two cubits thick. The portico of the gateway faced the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Inside the east gate were three alcoves on each side; the three had the same measurements, and the faces of the projecting walls on each side had the same measurements.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then he measured the width of the entrance to the gateway; it was ten cubits and its length was thirteen cubits.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">In front of each alcove was a wall one cubit high, and the alcoves were six cubits square.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then he measured the gateway from the top of the rear wall of one alcove to the top of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits from one parapet opening to the opposite one.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He measured along the faces of the projecting walls all around the inside of the gateway-sixty cubits. The measurement was up to the portico facing the courtyard.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of its portico was fifty cubits.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The alcoves and the projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted by narrow parapet openings all around, as was the portico; the openings all around faced inward. The faces of the projecting walls were decorated with palm trees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then he brought me into the outer court. There I saw some rooms and a pavement that had been constructed all around the court; there were thirty rooms along the pavement.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">It abutted the sides of the gateways and was as wide as they were long; this was the lower pavement.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then he measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; it was a hundred cubits on the east side as well as on the north.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then he measured the length and width of the gate facing north, leading into the outer court.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Its alcoves-three on each side-its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as those of the first gateway. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Its openings, its portico and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there was on the east. He measured from one gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred cubits.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then he led me to the south side and I saw a gate facing south. He measured its jambs and its portico, and they had the same measurements as the others.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The gateway and its portico had narrow openings all around, like the openings of the others. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them; it had palm tree decorations on the faces of the projecting walls on each side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured from this gate to the outer gate on the south side; it was a hundred cubits.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then he brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">(The porticoes of the gateways around the inner court were twenty-five cubits wide and five cubits deep.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated its jambs, and eight steps led up to it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it. It had the same measurements as the others,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">as did its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico, and it had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">A room with a doorway was by the portico in each of the inner gateways, where the burnt offerings were washed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">In the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings and guilt offerings were slaughtered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">By the outside wall of the portico of the gateway, near the steps at the entrance to the north gateway were two tables, and on the other side of the steps were two tables.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other-eight tables in all-on which the sacrifices were slaughtered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings, each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit high. On them were placed the utensils for slaughtering the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">And double-pronged hooks, each a handbreadth long, were attached to the wall all around. The tables were for the flesh of the offerings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, were two rooms, one at the side of the north gate and facing south, and another at the side of the south gate and facing north.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">He said to me, "The room facing south is for the priests who have charge of the temple,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">and the room facing north is for the priests who have charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who are the only Levites who may draw near to the LORD to minister before him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">Then he measured the court: It was square-a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in front of the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">He brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of the portico; they were five cubits wide on either side. The width of the entrance was fourteen cubits and its projecting walls were three cubits wide on either side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">The portico was twenty cubits wide, and twelve cubits from front to back. It was reached by a flight of stairs, and there were pillars on each side of the jambs.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="41">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the man brought me to the outer sanctuary and measured the jambs; the width of the jambs was six cubits on each side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The entrance was ten cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were five cubits wide. He also measured the outer sanctuary; it was forty cubits long and twenty cubits wide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance; each was two cubits wide. The entrance was six cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were seven cubits wide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And he measured the length of the inner sanctuary; it was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits across the end of the outer sanctuary. He said to me, "This is the Most Holy Place."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was six cubits thick, and each side room around the temple was four cubits wide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The side rooms were on three levels, one above another, thirty on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports were not inserted into the wall of the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The side rooms all around the temple were wider at each successive level. The structure surrounding the temple was built in ascending stages, so that the rooms widened as one went upward. A stairway went up from the lowest floor to the top floor through the middle floor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it, forming the foundation of the side rooms. It was the length of the rod, six long cubits.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. The open area between the side rooms of the temple</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">and the priests' rooms was twenty cubits wide all around the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">There were entrances to the side rooms from the open area, one on the north and another on the south; and the base adjoining the open area was five cubits wide all around.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The building facing the temple courtyard on the west side was seventy cubits wide. The wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then he measured the temple; it was a hundred cubits long, and the temple courtyard and the building with its walls were also a hundred cubits long.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The width of the temple courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was a hundred cubits.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple, including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred cubits. The outer sanctuary, the inner sanctuary and the portico facing the court,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">as well as the thresholds and the narrow windows and galleries around the three of them-everything beyond and including the threshold was covered with wood. The floor, the wall up to the windows, and the windows were covered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary and on the walls at regular intervals all around the inner and outer sanctuary</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">were carved cherubim and palm trees. Palm trees alternated with cherubim. Each cherub had two faces:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">the face of a man toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other. They were carved all around the whole temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">From the floor to the area above the entrance, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall of the outer sanctuary.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The outer sanctuary had a rectangular doorframe, and the one at the front of the Most Holy Place was similar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">There was a wooden altar three cubits high and two cubits square; its corners, its base and its sides were of wood. The man said to me, "This is the table that is before the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Both the outer sanctuary and the Most Holy Place had double doors.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Each door had two leaves-two hinged leaves for each door.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">And on the doors of the outer sanctuary were carved cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls, and there was a wooden overhang on the front of the portico.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">On the sidewalls of the portico were narrow windows with palm trees carved on each side. The side rooms of the temple also had overhangs.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="42">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the man led me northward into the outer court and brought me to the rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on the north side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Both in the section twenty cubits from the inner court and in the section opposite the pavement of the outer court, gallery faced gallery at the three levels.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">In front of the rooms was an inner passageway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long. Their doors were on the north.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Now the upper rooms were narrower, for the galleries took more space from them than from the rooms on the lower and middle floors of the building.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The rooms on the third floor had no pillars, as the courts had; so they were smaller in floor space than those on the lower and middle floors.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">There was an outer wall parallel to the rooms and the outer court; it extended in front of the rooms for fifty cubits.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">While the row of rooms on the side next to the outer court was fifty cubits long, the row on the side nearest the sanctuary was a hundred cubits long.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The lower rooms had an entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">On the south side along the length of the wall of the outer court, adjoining the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall, were rooms</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">with a passageway in front of them. These were like the rooms on the north; they had the same length and width, with similar exits and dimensions. Similar to the doorways on the north</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">were the doorways of the rooms on the south. There was a doorway at the beginning of the passageway that was parallel to the corresponding wall extending eastward, by which one enters the rooms.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then he said to me, "The north and south rooms facing the temple courtyard are the priests' rooms, where the priests who approach the LORD will eat the most holy offerings. There they will put the most holy offerings-the grain offerings, the sin offerings and the guilt offerings-for the place is holy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Once the priests enter the holy precincts, they are not to go into the outer court until they leave behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they go near the places that are for the people."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When he had finished measuring what was inside the temple area, he led me out by the east gate and measured the area all around:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He measured the east side with the measuring rod; it was five hundred cubits.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He measured the north side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He measured the south side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then he turned to the west side and measured; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall around it, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate the holy from the common.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="43">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the man brought me to the gate facing east,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the roar of rushing waters, and the land was radiant with his glory.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when he came to destroy the city and like the visions I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The glory of the LORD entered the temple through the gate facing east.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He said: "Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet. This is where I will live among the Israelites forever. The house of Israel will never again defile my holy name-neither they nor their kings-by their prostitution and the lifeless idols of their kings at their high places.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by their detestable practices. So I destroyed them in my anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Now let them put away from me their prostitution and the lifeless idols of their kings, and I will live among them forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Son of man, describe the temple to the people of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their sins. Let them consider the plan,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">and if they are ashamed of all they have done, make known to them the design of the temple-its arrangement, its exits and entrances-its whole design and all its regulations and laws. Write these down before them so that they may be faithful to its design and follow all its regulations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"This is the law of the temple: All the surrounding area on top of the mountain will be most holy. Such is the law of the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits, that cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth: Its gutter is a cubit deep and a cubit wide, with a rim of one span around the edge. And this is the height of the altar:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">From the gutter on the ground up to the lower ledge it is two cubits high and a cubit wide, and from the smaller ledge up to the larger ledge it is four cubits high and a cubit wide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The altar hearth is four cubits high, and four horns project upward from the hearth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The altar hearth is square, twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The upper ledge also is square, fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide, with a rim of half a cubit and a gutter of a cubit all around. The steps of the altar face east."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then he said to me, "Son of man, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: These will be the regulations for sacrificing burnt offerings and sprinkling blood upon the altar when it is built:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">You are to give a young bull as a sin offering to the priests, who are Levites, of the family of Zadok, who come near to minister before me, declares the Sovereign LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the upper ledge and all around the rim, and so purify the altar and make atonement for it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">You are to take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the designated part of the temple area outside the sanctuary.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"On the second day you are to offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering, and the altar is to be purified as it was purified with the bull.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">When you have finished purifying it, you are to offer a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">You are to offer them before the LORD, and the priests are to sprinkle salt on them and sacrifice them as a burnt offering to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"For seven days you are to provide a male goat daily for a sin offering; you are also to provide a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">For seven days they are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; thus they will dedicate it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">At the end of these days, from the eighth day on, the priests are to present your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar. Then I will accept you, declares the Sovereign LORD."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="44">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the man brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, the one facing east, and it was shut.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The LORD said to me, "This gate is to remain shut. It must not be opened; no one may enter through it. It is to remain shut because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered through it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The prince himself is the only one who may sit inside the gateway to eat in the presence of the LORD. He is to enter by way of the portico of the gateway and go out the same way."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the man brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple. I looked and saw the glory of the LORD filling the temple of the LORD, and I fell facedown.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The LORD said to me, "Son of man, look carefully, listen closely and give attention to everything I tell you concerning all the regulations regarding the temple of the LORD. Give attention to the entrance of the temple and all the exits of the sanctuary.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Say to the rebellious house of Israel, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Enough of your detestable practices, O house of Israel!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">In addition to all your other detestable practices, you brought foreigners uncircumcised in heart and flesh into my sanctuary, desecrating my temple while you offered me food, fat and blood, and you broke my covenant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Instead of carrying out your duty in regard to my holy things, you put others in charge of my sanctuary.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">This is what the Sovereign LORD says: No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and flesh is to enter my sanctuary, not even the foreigners who live among the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"'The Levites who went far from me when Israel went astray and who wandered from me after their idols must bear the consequences of their sin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">They may serve in my sanctuary, having charge of the gates of the temple and serving in it; they may slaughter the burnt offerings and sacrifices for the people and stand before the people and serve them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But because they served them in the presence of their idols and made the house of Israel fall into sin, therefore I have sworn with uplifted hand that they must bear the consequences of their sin, declares the Sovereign LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">They are not to come near to serve me as priests or come near any of my holy things or my most holy offerings; they must bear the shame of their detestable practices.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Yet I will put them in charge of the duties of the temple and all the work that is to be done in it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"'But the priests, who are Levites and descendants of Zadok and who faithfully carried out the duties of my sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from me, are to come near to minister before me; they are to stand before me to offer sacrifices of fat and blood, declares the Sovereign LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">They alone are to enter my sanctuary; they alone are to come near my table to minister before me and perform my service.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"'When they enter the gates of the inner court, they are to wear linen clothes; they must not wear any woolen garment while ministering at the gates of the inner court or inside the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">They are to wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments around their waists. They must not wear anything that makes them perspire.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When they go out into the outer court where the people are, they are to take off the clothes they have been ministering in and are to leave them in the sacred rooms, and put on other clothes, so that they do not consecrate the people by means of their garments.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"'They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long, but they are to keep the hair of their heads trimmed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">No priest is to drink wine when he enters the inner court.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">They must not marry widows or divorced women; they may marry only virgins of Israelite descent or widows of priests.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">They are to teach my people the difference between the holy and the common and show them how to distinguish between the unclean and the clean.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"'In any dispute, the priests are to serve as judges and decide it according to my ordinances. They are to keep my laws and my decrees for all my appointed feasts, and they are to keep my Sabbaths holy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"'A priest must not defile himself by going near a dead person; however, if the dead person was his father or mother, son or daughter, brother or unmarried sister, then he may defile himself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">After he is cleansed, he must wait seven days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">On the day he goes into the inner court of the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary, he is to offer a sin offering for himself, declares the Sovereign LORD.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the articles from the temple of God. These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia and put in the treasure house of his god.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring in some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">young men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king's palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king's table. They were to be trained for three years, and after that they were to enter the king's service.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Among these were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Now God had caused the official to show favor and sympathy to Daniel,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">but the official told Daniel, "I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would then have my head because of you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">At the end of the time set by the king to bring them in, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king's service.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">he said to them, "I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means. "</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic, "O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The king replied to the astrologers, "This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Once more they replied, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then the king answered, "I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">If you do not tell me the dream, there is just one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The astrologers answered the king, "There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among men."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">When Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He asked the king's officer, "Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?" Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">and said: "Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He changes times and seasons; he sets up kings and deposes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">I thank and praise you, O God of my fathers: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, "Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, "I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), "Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Daniel replied, "No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">"As you were lying there, O king, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O king, may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">"You looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue-an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">"This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">in your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">"After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron-for iron breaks and smashes everything-and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">"In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands-a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. "The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">The king said to Daniel, "Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">Moreover, at Daniel's request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, ninety feet high and nine feet wide, and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the herald loudly proclaimed, "This is what you are commanded to do, O peoples, nations and men of every language:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">At this time some astrologers came forward and denounced the Jews.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">You have issued a decree, O king, that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon-Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego-who pay no attention to you, O king. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The king's command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, "Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?" They replied, "Certainly, O king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">He said, "Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, "Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!" So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then Nebuchadnezzar said, "Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king's command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">King Nebuchadnezzar, To the peoples, nations and men of every language, who live in all the world: May you prosper greatly!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; his dominion endures from generation to generation.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my palace, contented and prosperous.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I had a dream that made me afraid. As I was lying in my bed, the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So I commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners came, I told them the dream, but they could not interpret it for me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Finally, Daniel came into my presence and I told him the dream. (He is called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I said, "Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you. Here is my dream; interpret it for me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">These are the visions I saw while lying in my bed: I looked, and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its height was enormous.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky; it was visible to the ends of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all. Under it the beasts of the field found shelter, and the birds of the air lived in its branches; from it every creature was fed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"In the visions I saw while lying in my bed, I looked, and there before me was a messenger, a holy one, coming down from heaven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He called in a loud voice: 'Cut down the tree and trim off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But let the stump and its roots, bound with iron and bronze, remain in the ground, in the grass of the field. "'Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal, till seven times pass by for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"'The decision is announced by messengers, the holy ones declare the verdict, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the lowliest of men.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means, for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was greatly perplexed for a time, and his thoughts terrified him. So the king said, "Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you." Belteshazzar answered, "My lord, if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, with its top touching the sky, visible to the whole earth,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit, providing food for all, giving shelter to the beasts of the field, and having nesting places in its branches for the birds of the air-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">you, O king, are that tree! You have become great and strong; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"You, O king, saw a messenger, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, 'Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump, bound with iron and bronze, in the grass of the field, while its roots remain in the ground. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven; let him live like the wild animals, until seven times pass by for him.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Therefore, O king, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">he said, "Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">The words were still on his lips when a voice came from heaven, "This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like cattle. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like cattle. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion; his kingdom endures from generation to generation.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him: "What have you done?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything he does is right and all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride he is able to humble.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So they brought in the gold goblets that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The king called out for the enchanters, astrologers and diviners to be brought and said to these wise men of Babylon, "Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The queen, hearing the voices of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet hall. "O king, live forever!" she said. "Don't be alarmed! Don't look so pale!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar your father-your father the king, I say-appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">This man Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, "Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not explain it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Now I have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel answered the king, "You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"O king, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Because of the high position he gave him, all the peoples and nations and men of every language dreaded and feared him. Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to death; those he wanted to spare, he spared; those he wanted to promote, he promoted; and those he wanted to humble, he humbled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like cattle; and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone he wishes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"But you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"This is the inscription that was written: Mene, Mene, Tekel, Parsin</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">"This is what these words mean: Mene: God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Tekel: You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Peres: Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Then at Belshazzar's command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">That very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians, was slain,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Finally these men said, "We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So the administrators and the satraps went as a group to the king and said: "O King Darius, live forever!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or man during the next thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be thrown into the lions' den.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Now, O king, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered-in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So King Darius put the decree in writing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: "Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or man except to you, O king, would be thrown into the lions' den?" The king answered, "The decree stands-in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then they said to the king, "Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then the men went as a group to the king and said to him, "Remember, O king, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions' den. The king said to Daniel, "May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel's situation might not be changed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions' den.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, "Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Daniel answered, "O king, live forever!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, O king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">At the king's command, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions' den, along with their wives and children. And before they reached the floor of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations and men of every language throughout the land: "May you prosper greatly!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">"I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel. "For he is the living God and he endures forever; his kingdom will not be destroyed, his dominion will never end.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">He rescues and he saves; he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth. He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Daniel said: "In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of flesh!'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast-terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"As I looked, "thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">(The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. "So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">'The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever-yes, for ever and ever.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws-the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell-the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">"'But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.'</VERS>

</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I watched the ram as he charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against him, and none could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at him in great rage.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">I saw him attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering his two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against him; the goat knocked him to the ground and trampled on him, and none could rescue the ram from his power.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The goat became very great, but at the height of his power his large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">It set itself up to be as great as the Prince of the host; it took away the daily sacrifice from him, and the place of his sanctuary was brought low.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Because of rebellion, the host of the saints and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, "How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled-the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host that will be trampled underfoot?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He said to me, "It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">And I heard a man's voice from the Ulai calling, "Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. "Son of man," he said to me, "understand that the vision concerns the time of the end."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He said: "I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between his eyes is the first king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a stern-faced king, a master of intrigue, will arise.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the mighty men and the holy people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">"The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for several days. Then I got up and went about the king's business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus (a Mede by descent), who was made ruler over the Babylonian kingdom-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the LORD given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed: "O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with all who love him and obey his commands,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Lord, you are righteous, but this day we are covered with shame-the men of Judah and people of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far, in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">O LORD, we and our kings, our princes and our fathers are covered with shame because we have sinned against you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">we have not obeyed the LORD our God or kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away, refusing to obey you. "Therefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing upon us great disaster. Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us, yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The LORD did not hesitate to bring the disaster upon us, for the LORD our God is righteous in everything he does; yet we have not obeyed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"Now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">O Lord, in keeping with all your righteous acts, turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem, your city, your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our fathers have made Jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to all those around us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, O Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Give ear, O God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">O Lord, listen! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, hear and act! For your sake, O my God, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your Name."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and making my request to the LORD my God for his holy hill-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">while I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">He instructed me and said to me, "Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">As soon as you began to pray, an answer was given, which I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed. Therefore, consider the message and understand the vision:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"Seventy 'sevens' are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"Know and understand this: From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven 'sevens,' and sixty-two 'sevens.' It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">After the sixty-two 'sevens,' the Anointed One will be cut off and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">He will confirm a covenant with many for one 'seven.' In the middle of the 'seven' he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on a wing of the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him. "</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel (who was called Belteshazzar). Its message was true and it concerned a great war. The understanding of the message came to him in a vision.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of the finest gold around his waist.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">His body was like chrysolite, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; the men with me did not see it, but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then I heard him speaking, and as I listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">A hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He said, "Daniel, you who are highly esteemed, consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you, and stand up, for I have now been sent to you." And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then he continued, "Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">While he was saying this to me, I bowed with my face toward the ground and was speechless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then one who looked like a man touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and began to speak. I said to the one standing before me, "I am overcome with anguish because of the vision, my lord, and I am helpless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">How can I, your servant, talk with you, my lord? My strength is gone and I can hardly breathe."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Do not be afraid, O man highly esteemed," he said. "Peace! Be strong now; be strong." When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, "Speak, my lord, since you have given me strength."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So he said, "Do you know why I have come to you? Soon I will return to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I go, the prince of Greece will come;</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">And in the first year of Darius the Mede, I took my stand to support and protect him.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Now then, I tell you the truth: Three more kings will appear in Persia, and then a fourth, who will be far richer than all the others. When he has gained power by his wealth, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then a mighty king will appear, who will rule with great power and do as he pleases.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">After he has appeared, his empire will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven. It will not go to his descendants, nor will it have the power he exercised, because his empire will be uprooted and given to others.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"The king of the South will become strong, but one of his commanders will become even stronger than he and will rule his own kingdom with great power.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">After some years, they will become allies. The daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to make an alliance, but she will not retain her power, and he and his power will not last. In those days she will be handed over, together with her royal escort and her father and the one who supported her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"One from her family line will arise to take her place. He will attack the forces of the king of the North and enter his fortress; he will fight against them and be victorious.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He will also seize their gods, their metal images and their valuable articles of silver and gold and carry them off to Egypt. For some years he will leave the king of the North alone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then the king of the North will invade the realm of the king of the South but will retreat to his own country.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">His sons will prepare for war and assemble a great army, which will sweep on like an irresistible flood and carry the battle as far as his fortress.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Then the king of the South will march out in a rage and fight against the king of the North, who will raise a large army, but it will be defeated.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When the army is carried off, the king of the South will be filled with pride and will slaughter many thousands, yet he will not remain triumphant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">For the king of the North will muster another army, larger than the first; and after several years, he will advance with a huge army fully equipped.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"In those times many will rise against the king of the South. The violent men among your own people will rebel in fulfillment of the vision, but without success.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then the king of the North will come and build up siege ramps and will capture a fortified city. The forces of the South will be powerless to resist; even their best troops will not have the strength to stand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The invader will do as he pleases; no one will be able to stand against him. He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land and will have the power to destroy it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He will determine to come with the might of his entire kingdom and will make an alliance with the king of the South. And he will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom, but his plans will not succeed or help him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then he will turn his attention to the coastlands and will take many of them, but a commander will put an end to his insolence and will turn his insolence back upon him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">After this, he will turn back toward the fortresses of his own country but will stumble and fall, to be seen no more.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. In a few years, however, he will be destroyed, yet not in anger or in battle.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="22">Then an overwhelming army will be swept away before him; both it and a prince of the covenant will be destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">After coming to an agreement with him, he will act deceitfully, and with only a few people he will rise to power.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">When the richest provinces feel secure, he will invade them and will achieve what neither his fathers nor his forefathers did. He will distribute plunder, loot and wealth among his followers. He will plot the overthrow of fortresses-but only for a time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"With a large army he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will wage war with a large and very powerful army, but he will not be able to stand because of the plots devised against him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Those who eat from the king's provisions will try to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall in battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but to no avail, because an end will still come at the appointed time.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="29">"At the appointed time he will invade the South again, but this time the outcome will be different from what it was before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Ships of the western coastlands will oppose him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and vent his fury against the holy covenant. He will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">The word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But Jonah ran away from the LORD and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, where he found a ship bound for that port. After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the LORD sent a great wind on the sea, and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The captain went to him and said, "How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Maybe he will take notice of us, and we will not perish."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then the sailors said to each other, "Come, let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity." They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So they asked him, "Tell us, who is responsible for making all this trouble for us? What do you do? Where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He answered, "I am a Hebrew and I worship the LORD, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the land."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">This terrified them and they asked, "What have you done?" (They knew he was running away from the LORD, because he had already told them so.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The sea was getting rougher and rougher. So they asked him, "What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"Pick me up and throw me into the sea," he replied, "and it will become calm. I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Instead, the men did their best to row back to land. But they could not, for the sea grew even wilder than before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then they cried to the LORD, "O LORD, please do not let us die for taking this man's life. Do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man, for you, O LORD, have done as you pleased."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the raging sea grew calm.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">At this the men greatly feared the LORD, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But the LORD provided a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the LORD his God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He said: "In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. From the depths of the grave I called for help, and you listened to my cry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">You hurled me into the deep, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me; all your waves and breakers swept over me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I said, 'I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The engulfing waters threatened me, the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But you brought my life up from the pit, O LORD my God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, LORD, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But I, with a song of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will make good. Salvation comes from the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Jonah obeyed the word of the LORD and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very important city-a visit required three days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">On the first day, Jonah started into the city. He proclaimed: "Forty more days and Nineveh will be overturned."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The Ninevites believed God. They declared a fast, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then he issued a proclamation in Nineveh: "By the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let any man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">But Jonah was greatly displeased and became angry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He prayed to the LORD, "O LORD, is this not what I said when I was still at home? That is why I was so quick to flee to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now, O LORD, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But the LORD replied, "Have you any right to be angry?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Jonah went out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then the LORD God provided a vine and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was very happy about the vine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But at dawn the next day God provided a worm, which chewed the vine so that it withered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die, and said, "It would be better for me to die than to live."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But God said to Jonah, "Do you have a right to be angry about the vine?I do," he said. "I am angry enough to die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But the LORD said, "You have been concerned about this vine, though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But Nineveh has more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left, and many cattle as well. Should I not be concerned about that great city?"</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">The word of the LORD that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah-the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Hear, O peoples, all of you, listen, O earth and all who are in it, that the Sovereign LORD may witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Look! The LORD is coming from his dwelling place; he comes down and treads the high places of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The mountains melt beneath him and the valleys split apart, like wax before the fire, like water rushing down a slope.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">All this is because of Jacob's transgression, because of the sins of the house of Israel. What is Jacob's transgression? Is it not Samaria? What is Judah's high place? Is it not Jerusalem?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble, a place for planting vineyards. I will pour her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">All her idols will be broken to pieces; all her temple gifts will be burned with fire; I will destroy all her images. Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes, as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Because of this I will weep and wail; I will go about barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">For her wound is incurable; it has come to Judah. It has reached the very gate of my people, even to Jerusalem itself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Tell it not in Gath; weep not at all. In Beth Ophrah roll in the dust.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Pass on in nakedness and shame, you who live in Shaphir. Those who live in Zaanan will not come out. Beth Ezel is in mourning; its protection is taken from you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Those who live in Maroth writhe in pain, waiting for relief, because disaster has come from the LORD, even to the gate of Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">You who live in Lachish, harness the team to the chariot. You were the beginning of sin to the Daughter of Zion, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Therefore you will give parting gifts to Moresheth Gath. The town of Aczib will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">I will bring a conqueror against you who live in Mareshah. He who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Shave your heads in mourning for the children in whom you delight; make yourselves as bald as the vulture, for they will go from you into exile.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">Woe to those who plan iniquity, to those who plot evil on their beds! At morning's light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them. They defraud a man of his home, a fellowman of his inheritance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Therefore, the LORD says: "I am planning disaster against this people, from which you cannot save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">In that day men will ridicule you; they will taunt you with this mournful song: 'We are utterly ruined; my people's possession is divided up. He takes it from me! He assigns our fields to traitors.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the LORD to divide the land by lot.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Do not prophesy," their prophets say. "Do not prophesy about these things; disgrace will not overtake us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Should it be said, O house of Jacob: "Is the Spirit of the LORD angry? Does he do such things?Do not my words do good to him whose ways are upright?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Lately my people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care, like men returning from battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes. You take away my blessing from their children forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Get up, go away! For this is not your resting place, because it is defiled, it is ruined, beyond all remedy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">If a liar and deceiver comes and says, 'I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,' he would be just the prophet for this people!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will throng with people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their king will pass through before them, the LORD at their head."</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then I said, "Listen, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel. Should you not know justice,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">who eat my people's flesh, strip off their skin and break their bones in pieces; who chop them up like meat for the pan, like flesh for the pot?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then they will cry out to the LORD, but he will not answer them. At that time he will hide his face from them because of the evil they have done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">This is what the LORD says: "As for the prophets who lead my people astray, if one feeds them, they proclaim 'peace'; if he does not, they prepare to wage war against him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Therefore night will come over you, without visions, and darkness, without divination. The sun will set for the prophets, and the day will go dark for them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The seers will be ashamed and the diviners disgraced. They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the LORD, and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, to Israel his sin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Hear this, you leaders of the house of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel, who despise justice and distort all that is right;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">who build Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with wickedness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Her leaders judge for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, and her prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet they lean upon the LORD and say, "Is not the LORD among us? No disaster will come upon us."</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="10">Writhe in agony, O Daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you must leave the city to camp in the open field. You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued. There the LORD will redeem you out of the hand of your enemies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But now many nations are gathered against you. They say, "Let her be defiled, let our eyes gloat over Zion!"</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrong? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Look at the nations and watch- and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">I am raising up the Babylonians, that ruthless and impetuous people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwelling places not their own.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They are a feared and dreaded people; they are a law to themselves and promote their own honor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong; their horsemen come from afar. They fly like a vulture swooping to devour;</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="12">O LORD, are you not from everlasting? My God, my Holy One, we will not die. O LORD, you have appointed them to execute judgment; O Rock, you have ordained them to punish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrong. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="7">On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">During the night I had a vision-and there before me was a man riding a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I asked, "What are these, my lord?" The angel who was talking with me answered, "I will show you what they are."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, "They are the ones the LORD has sent to go throughout the earth."</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="12">Then the angel of the LORD said, "LORD Almighty, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and from the towns of Judah, which you have been angry with these seventy years?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So the LORD spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then the angel who was speaking to me said, "Proclaim this word: This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="18">Then I looked up-and there before me were four horns!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">I asked the angel who was speaking to me, "What are these?" He answered me, "These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">I asked, "What are these coming to do?" He answered, "These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise his head, but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter its people."</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">A day of the LORD is coming when your plunder will be divided among you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to fight against it; the city will be captured, the houses ransacked, and the women raped. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then the LORD will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights in the day of battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">You will flee by my mountain valley, for it will extend to Azel. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">On that day there will be no light, no cold or frost.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">It will be a unique day, without daytime or nighttime-a day known to the LORD. When evening comes, there will be light.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half to the eastern sea and half to the western sea, in summer and in winter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The LORD will be king over the whole earth. On that day there will be one LORD, and his name the only name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah. But Jerusalem will be raised up and remain in its place, from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">It will be inhabited; never again will it be destroyed. Jerusalem will be secure.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">This is the plague with which the LORD will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">On that day men will be stricken by the LORD with great panic. Each man will seize the hand of another, and they will attack each other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Judah too will fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected-great quantities of gold and silver and clothing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">A similar plague will strike the horses and mules, the camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD Almighty, and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">If any of the peoples of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD Almighty, they will have no rain.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">If the Egyptian people do not go up and take part, they will have no rain. The LORD will bring on them the plague he inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">On that dayHOLY TO THE LORD will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the LORD's house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the LORD Almighty, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of the pots and cook in them. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD Almighty.</VERS>

<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="39" bname="Malachi" bsname="Mal">
<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">An oracle: The word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"I have loved you," says the LORD. "But you ask, 'How have you loved us?'"Was not Esau Jacob's brother?" the LORD says. "Yet I have loved Jacob,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">but Esau I have hated, and I have turned his mountains into a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Edom may say, "Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins." But this is what the LORD Almighty says: "They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land, a people always under the wrath of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">You will see it with your own eyes and say, 'Great is the LORD -even beyond the borders of Israel!'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, where is the honor due me? If I am a master, where is the respect due me?" says the LORD Almighty. "It is you, O priests, who show contempt for my name. "But you ask, 'How have we shown contempt for your name?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"You place defiled food on my altar. "But you ask, 'How have we defiled you?'"By saying that the LORD's table is contemptible.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When you bring blind animals for sacrifice, is that not wrong? When you sacrifice crippled or diseased animals, is that not wrong? Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you?" says the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Now implore God to be gracious to us. With such offerings from your hands, will he accept you?"-says the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Oh, that one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would not light useless fires on my altar! I am not pleased with you," says the LORD Almighty, "and I will accept no offering from your hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">My name will be great among the nations, from the rising to the setting of the sun. In every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to my name, because my name will be great among the nations," says the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"But you profane it by saying of the Lord's table, 'It is defiled,' and of its food, 'It is contemptible.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And you say, 'What a burden!' and you sniff at it contemptuously," says the LORD Almighty. "When you bring injured, crippled or diseased animals and offer them as sacrifices, should I accept them from your hands?" says the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"Cursed is the cheat who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it, but then sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord. For I am a great king," says the LORD Almighty, "and my name is to be feared among the nations.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">"And now this admonition is for you, O priests.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">If you do not listen, and if you do not set your heart to honor my name," says the LORD Almighty, "I will send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have already cursed them, because you have not set your heart to honor me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"Because of you I will rebuke your descendants; I will spread on your faces the offal from your festival sacrifices, and you will be carried off with it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And you will know that I have sent you this admonition so that my covenant with Levi may continue," says the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"My covenant was with him, a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him; this called for reverence and he revered me and stood in awe of my name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">True instruction was in his mouth and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many from sin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, and from his mouth men should seek instruction-because he is the messenger of the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But you have turned from the way and by your teaching have caused many to stumble; you have violated the covenant with Levi," says the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people, because you have not followed my ways but have shown partiality in matters of the law."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Have we not all one Father? Did not one God create us? Why do we profane the covenant of our fathers by breaking faith with one another?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Judah has broken faith. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem: Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the LORD loves, by marrying the daughter of a foreign god.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, may the LORD cut him off from the tents of Jacob -even though he brings offerings to the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Another thing you do: You flood the LORD's altar with tears. You weep and wail because he no longer pays attention to your offerings or accepts them with pleasure from your hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">You ask, "Why?" It is because the LORD is acting as the witness between you and the wife of your youth, because you have broken faith with her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Has not the LORD made them one? In flesh and spirit they are his. And why one? Because he was seeking godly offspring. So guard yourself in your spirit, and do not break faith with the wife of your youth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"I hate divorce," says the LORD God of Israel, "and I hate a man's covering himself with violence as well as with his garment," says the LORD Almighty. So guard yourself in your spirit, and do not break faith.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">You have wearied the LORD with your words. "How have we wearied him?" you ask. By saying, "All who do evil are good in the eyes of the LORD, and he is pleased with them" or "Where is the God of justice?"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">"See, I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come," says the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">But who can endure the day of his coming? Who can stand when he appears? For he will be like a refiner's fire or a launderer's soap.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then the LORD will have men who will bring offerings in righteousness,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">and the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to the LORD, as in days gone by, as in former years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"So I will come near to you for judgment. I will be quick to testify against sorcerers, adulterers and perjurers, against those who defraud laborers of their wages, who oppress the widows and the fatherless, and deprive aliens of justice, but do not fear me," says the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"I the LORD do not change. So you, O descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Ever since the time of your forefathers you have turned away from my decrees and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you," says the LORD Almighty. "But you ask, 'How are we to return?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me. "But you ask, 'How do we rob you?'"In tithes and offerings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">You are under a curse-the whole nation of you-because you are robbing me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this," says the LORD Almighty, "and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">I will prevent pests from devouring your crops, and the vines in your fields will not cast their fruit," says the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"Then all the nations will call you blessed, for yours will be a delightful land," says the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"You have said harsh things against me," says the LORD. "Yet you ask, 'What have we said against you?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"You have said, 'It is futile to serve God. What did we gain by carrying out his requirements and going about like mourners before the LORD Almighty?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But now we call the arrogant blessed. Certainly the evildoers prosper, and even those who challenge God escape.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then those who feared the LORD talked with each other, and the LORD listened and heard. A scroll of remembrance was written in his presence concerning those who feared the LORD and honored his name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"They will be mine," says the LORD Almighty, "in the day when I make up my treasured possession. I will spare them, just as in compassion a man spares his son who serves him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And you will again see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">"Surely the day is coming; it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble, and that day that is coming will set them on fire," says the LORD Almighty. "Not a root or a branch will be left to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. And you will go out and leap like calves released from the stall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then you will trample down the wicked; they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I do these things," says the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"Remember the law of my servant Moses, the decrees and laws I gave him at Horeb for all Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"See, I will send you the prophet Elijah before that great and dreadful day of the LORD comes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers; or else I will come and strike the land with a curse."</VERS>
