<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">After the death of Saul, David returned from defeating the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">On the third day a man arrived from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and with dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"Where have you come from?" David asked him. He answered, "I have escaped from the Israelite camp."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"What happened?" David asked. "Tell me." He said, "The men fled from the battle. Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"I happened to be on Mount Gilboa," the young man said, "and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and riders almost upon him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, 'What can I do?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"He asked me, 'Who are you?'"'An Amalekite,' I answered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Then he said to me, 'Stand over me and kill me! I am in the throes of death, but I'm still alive.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">David said to the young man who brought him the report, "Where are you from?I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite," he answered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">David asked him, "Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then David called one of his men and said, "Go, strike him down!" So he struck him down, and he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">For David had said to him, "Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, 'I killed the LORD's anointed.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">and ordered that the men of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar):</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"O mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, nor fields that yield offerings of grain. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul-no longer rubbed with oil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"Saul and Jonathan- in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">"How the mighty have fallen! The weapons of war have perished!"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the course of time, David inquired of the LORD. "Shall I go up to one of the towns of Judah?" he asked. The LORD said, "Go up." David asked, "Where shall I go?To Hebron," the LORD answered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">David also took the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in Hebron and its towns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the men of Judah came to Hebron and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. When David was told that it was the men of Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">he sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead to say to them, "The LORD bless you for showing this kindness to Saul your master by burying him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">May the LORD now show you kindness and faithfulness, and I too will show you the same favor because you have done this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now then, be strong and brave, for Saul your master is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul's army, had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He made him king over Gilead, Ashuri and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The length of time David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Abner son of Ner, together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Joab son of Zeruiah and David's men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then Abner said to Joab, "Let's have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us.All right, let them do it," Joab said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So they stood up and were counted off-twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent's side, and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by David's men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He chased Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Abner looked behind him and asked, "Is that you, Asahel?It is," he answered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Abner said to him, "Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons." But Asahel would not stop chasing him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Again Abner warned Asahel, "Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel's stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Abner called out to Joab, "Must the sword devour forever? Don't you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their brothers?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Joab answered, "As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued the pursuit of their brothers until morning. "</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, continued through the whole Bithron and came to Mahanaim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then Joab returned from pursuing Abner and assembled all his men. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David's men were found missing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">But David's men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">They took Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">his second, Kileab the son of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; the third, Absalom the son of Maacah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">and the sixth, Ithream the son of David's wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had been strengthening his own position in the house of Saul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now Saul had had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, "Why did you sleep with my father's concubine?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said and he answered, "Am I a dog's head-on Judah's side? This very day I am loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I haven't handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">May God deal with Abner, be it ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the LORD promised him on oath</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David's throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, "Whose land is it? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you bring all Israel over to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"Good," said David. "I will make an agreement with you. But I demand one thing of you: Do not come into my presence unless you bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, "Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Her husband, however, went with her, weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go back home!" So he went back.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, "For some time you have wanted to make David your king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Now do it! For the LORD promised David, 'By my servant David I will rescue my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Abner also spoke to the Benjamites in person. Then he went to Hebron to tell David everything that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin wanted to do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">When Abner, who had twenty men with him, came to David at Hebron, David prepared a feast for him and his men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Abner said to David, "Let me go at once and assemble all Israel for my lord the king, so that they may make a compact with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires." So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Just then David's men and Joab returned from a raid and brought with them a great deal of plunder. But Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived, he was told that Abner son of Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and that he had gone in peace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">So Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you let him go? Now he is gone!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">You know Abner son of Ner; he came to deceive you and observe your movements and find out everything you are doing."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Joab then left David and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Now when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the gateway, as though to speak with him privately. And there, to avenge the blood of his brother Asahel, Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Later, when David heard about this, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">May his blood fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house! May Joab's house never be without someone who has a running sore or leprosy or who leans on a crutch or who falls by the sword or who lacks food."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">(Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Then David said to Joab and all the people with him, "Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and walk in mourning in front of Abner." King David himself walked behind the bier.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wept aloud at Abner's tomb. All the people wept also.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">The king sang this lament for Abner: "Should Abner have died as the lawless die?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered. You fell as one falls before wicked men." And all the people wept over him again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Then they all came and urged David to eat something while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">All the people took note and were pleased; indeed, everything the king did pleased them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">So on that day all the people and all Israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Then the king said to his men, "Do you not realize that a prince and a great man has fallen in Israel this day?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">And today, though I am the anointed king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil deeds!"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Ish-Bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel became alarmed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Now Saul's son had two men who were leaders of raiding bands. One was named Baanah and the other Recab; they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the tribe of Benjamin-Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">because the people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and have lived there as aliens to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">(Jonathan son of Saul had a son who was lame in both feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she hurried to leave, he fell and became crippled. His name was Mephibosheth.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Now Recab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out for the house of Ish-Bosheth, and they arrived there in the heat of the day while he was taking his noonday rest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">They went into the inner part of the house as if to get some wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Recab and his brother Baanah slipped away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They had gone into the house while he was lying on the bed in his bedroom. After they stabbed and killed him, they cut off his head. Taking it with them, they traveled all night by way of the Arabah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, "Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy, who tried to take your life. This day the LORD has avenged my lord the king against Saul and his offspring."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">David answered Recab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out of all trouble,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">when a man told me, 'Saul is dead,' and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and put him to death in Ziklag. That was the reward I gave him for his news!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">How much more-when wicked men have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed-should I not now demand his blood from your hand and rid the earth of you!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">So David gave an order to his men, and they killed them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung the bodies by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-Bosheth and buried it in Abner's tomb at Hebron.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "We are your own flesh and blood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">In the past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the LORD said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, the king made a compact with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The king and his men marched to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived there. The Jebusites said to David, "You will not get in here; even the blind and the lame can ward you off." They thought, "David cannot get in here."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion, the City of David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">On that day, David said, "Anyone who conquers the Jebusites will have to use the water shaft to reach those 'lame and blind' who are David's enemies. "That is why they say, "The 'blind and lame' will not enter the palace."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">David then took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built up the area around it, from the supporting terraces inward.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And he became more and more powerful, because the LORD God Almighty was with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">And David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">After he left Hebron, David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">so David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" The LORD answered him, "Go, for I will surely hand the Philistines over to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So David went to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, "As waters break out, the LORD has broken out against my enemies before me." So that place was called Baal Perazim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them off.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Once more the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">so David inquired of the LORD, and he answered, "Do not go straight up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move quickly, because that will mean the LORD has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">So David did as the LORD commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">David again brought together out of Israel chosen men, thirty thousand in all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He and all his men set out from Baalah of Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, the name of the LORD Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim that are on the ark.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">with the ark of God on it, and Ahio was walking in front of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">David and the whole house of Israel were celebrating with all their might before the LORD, with songs and with harps, lyres, tambourines, sistrums and cymbals.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The LORD's anger burned against Uzzah because of his irreverent act; therefore God struck him down and he died there beside the ark of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then David was angry because the LORD's wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">David was afraid of the LORD that day and said, "How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He was not willing to take the ark of the LORD to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed him and his entire household.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Now King David was told, "The LORD has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and everything he has, because of the ark of God." So David went down and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with rejoicing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">When those who were carrying the ark of the LORD had taken six steps, he sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">David, wearing a linen ephod, danced before the LORD with all his might,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">while he and the entire house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouts and the sound of trumpets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">As the ark of the LORD was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, she despised him in her heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They brought the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">After he had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each person in the whole crowd of Israelites, both men and women. And all the people went to their homes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">When David returned home to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him and said, "How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, disrobing in the sight of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">David said to Michal, "It was before the LORD, who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house when he appointed me ruler over the LORD's people Israel-I will celebrate before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you spoke of, I will be held in honor."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">And Michal daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">After the king was settled in his palace and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">he said to Nathan the prophet, "Here I am, living in a palace of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Nathan replied to the king, "Whatever you have in mind, go ahead and do it, for the LORD is with you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">That night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD says: Are you the one to build me a house to dwell in?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this day. I have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their rulers whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Now then, tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says: I took you from the pasture and from following the flock to be ruler over my people Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the greatest men of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also give you rest from all your enemies. "'The LORD declares to you that the LORD himself will establish a house for you:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When your days are over and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, who will come from your own body, and I will establish his kingdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with the rod of men, with floggings inflicted by men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said: "Who am I, O Sovereign LORD, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">And as if this were not enough in your sight, O Sovereign LORD, you have also spoken about the future of the house of your servant. Is this your usual way of dealing with man, O Sovereign LORD?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, O Sovereign LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">For the sake of your word and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made it known to your servant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"How great you are, O Sovereign LORD! There is no one like you, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">And who is like your people Israel-the one nation on earth that God went out to redeem as a people for himself, and to make a name for himself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">You have established your people Israel as your very own forever, and you, O LORD, have become their God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"And now, LORD God, keep forever the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house. Do as you promised,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">so that your name will be great forever. Then men will say, 'The LORD Almighty is God over Israel!' And the house of your servant David will be established before you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">"O LORD Almighty, God of Israel, you have revealed this to your servant, saying, 'I will build a house for you.' So your servant has found courage to offer you this prayer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">O Sovereign LORD, you are God! Your words are trustworthy, and you have promised these good things to your servant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Now be pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, O Sovereign LORD, have spoken, and with your blessing the house of your servant will be blessed forever."</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Metheg Ammah from the control of the Philistines.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">David also defeated the Moabites. He made them lie down on the ground and measured them off with a length of cord. Every two lengths of them were put to death, and the third length was allowed to live. So the Moabites became subject to David and brought tribute.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Moreover, David fought Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to restore his control along the Euphrates River.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand charioteers and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot horses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand of them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He put garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to him and brought tribute. The LORD gave David victory wherever he went.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">From Tebah and Berothai, towns that belonged to Hadadezer, King David took a great quantity of bronze.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">he sent his son Joram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Joram brought with him articles of silver and gold and bronze.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">King David dedicated these articles to the LORD, as he had done with the silver and gold from all the nations he had subdued:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Edom and Moab, the Ammonites and the Philistines, and Amalek. He also dedicated the plunder taken from Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And David became famous after he returned from striking down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He put garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites became subject to David. The LORD gave David victory wherever he went.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was secretary;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David's sons were royal advisers.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">David asked, "Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan's sake?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Now there was a servant of Saul's household named Ziba. They called him to appear before David, and the king said to him, "Are you Ziba?Your servant," he replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The king asked, "Is there no one still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show God's kindness?" Ziba answered the king, "There is still a son of Jonathan; he is crippled in both feet."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"Where is he?" the king asked. Ziba answered, "He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So King David had him brought from Lo Debar, from the house of Makir son of Ammiel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he bowed down to pay him honor. David said, "Mephibosheth!Your servant," he replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Don't be afraid," David said to him, "for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Mephibosheth bowed down and said, "What is your servant, that you should notice a dead dog like me?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, "I have given your master's grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">You and your sons and your servants are to farm the land for him and bring in the crops, so that your master's grandson may be provided for. And Mephibosheth, grandson of your master, will always eat at my table." (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then Ziba said to the king, "Your servant will do whatever my lord the king commands his servant to do." So Mephibosheth ate at David's table like one of the king's sons.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica, and all the members of Ziba's household were servants of Mephibosheth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king's table, and he was crippled in both feet.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the course of time, the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">David thought, "I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me." So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When David's men came to the land of the Ammonites,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun their lord, "Do you think David is honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy? Hasn't David sent them to you to explore the city and spy it out and overthrow it?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So Hanun seized David's men, shaved off half of each man's beard, cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks, and sent them away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When David was told about this, he sent messengers to meet the men, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, "Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in David's nostrils, they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth Rehob and Zobah, as well as the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and also twelve thousand men from Tob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city gate, while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother and deployed them against the Ammonites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Joab said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to come to my rescue; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to rescue you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The LORD will do what is good in his sight."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were fleeing, they fled before Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab returned from fighting the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they regrouped.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Hadadezer had Arameans brought from beyond the River; they went to Helam, with Shobach the commander of Hadadezer's army leading them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan and went to Helam. The Arameans formed their battle lines to meet David and fought against him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven hundred of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also struck down Shobach the commander of their army, and he died there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When all the kings who were vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with the Israelites and became subject to them. So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab out with the king's men and the whole Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, "Isn't this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. (She had purified herself from her uncleanness.) Then she went back home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, "I am pregnant."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So David sent this word to Joab: "Send me Uriah the Hittite." And Joab sent him to David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were and how the war was going.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master's servants and did not go down to his house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When David was told, "Uriah did not go home," he asked him, "Haven't you just come from a distance? Why didn't you go home?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Uriah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my master Joab and my lord's men are camped in the open fields. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then David said to him, "Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">At David's invitation, he ate and drank with him, and David made him drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his master's servants; he did not go home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">In it he wrote, "Put Uriah in the front line where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So while Joab had the city under siege, he put Uriah at a place where he knew the strongest defenders were.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of the men in David's army fell; moreover, Uriah the Hittite died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Joab sent David a full account of the battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He instructed the messenger: "When you have finished giving the king this account of the battle,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">the king's anger may flare up, and he may ask you, 'Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Didn't you know they would shoot arrows from the wall?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Who killed Abimelech son of Jerub-Besheth? Didn't a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?' If he asks you this, then say to him, 'Also, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The messenger set out, and when he arrived he told David everything Joab had sent him to say.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The messenger said to David, "The men overpowered us and came out against us in the open, but we drove them back to the entrance to the city gate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then the archers shot arrows at your servants from the wall, and some of the king's men died. Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">David told the messenger, "Say this to Joab: 'Don't let this upset you; the sword devours one as well as another. Press the attack against the city and destroy it.' Say this to encourage Joab."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">When Uriah's wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">After the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing David had done displeased the LORD.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD sent Nathan to David. When he came to him, he said, "There were two men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, "As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then Nathan said to David, "You are the man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">I gave your master's house to you, and your master's wives into your arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Why did you despise the word of the LORD by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"This is what the LORD says: 'Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity upon you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">You did it in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." Nathan replied, "The LORD has taken away your sin. You are not going to die.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">But because by doing this you have made the enemies of the LORD show utter contempt, the son born to you will die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">After Nathan had gone home, the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife had borne to David, and he became ill.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and went into his house and spent the nights lying on the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food with them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">On the seventh day the child died. David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, "While the child was still living, we spoke to David but he would not listen to us. How can we tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">David noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves and he realized the child was dead. "Is the child dead?" he asked. "Yes," they replied, "he is dead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request they served him food, and he ate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">His servants asked him, "Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">He answered, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, 'Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me and let the child live.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and lay with her. She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. The LORD loved him;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">and because the LORD loved him, he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Meanwhile Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal citadel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Joab then sent messengers to David, saying, "I have fought against Rabbah and taken its water supply.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Now muster the rest of the troops and besiege the city and capture it. Otherwise I will take the city, and it will be named after me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">So David mustered the entire army and went to Rabbah, and attacked and captured it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">He took the crown from the head of their king -its weight was a talent of gold, and it was set with precious stones-and it was placed on David's head. He took a great quantity of plunder from the city</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes, and he made them work at brickmaking. He did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Amnon became frustrated to the point of illness on account of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He asked Amnon, "Why do you, the king's son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won't you tell me?" Amnon said to him, "I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Go to bed and pretend to be ill," Jonadab said. "When your father comes to see you, say to him, 'I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, "I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">David sent word to Tamar at the palace: "Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat. "Send everyone out of here," Amnon said. So everyone left him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand." And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, "Come to bed with me, my sister."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"Don't, my brother!" she said to him. "Don't force me. Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don't do this wicked thing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">What about me? Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king; he will not keep me from being married to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, "Get up and get out!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"No!" she said to him. "Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me." But he refused to listen to her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He called his personal servant and said, "Get this woman out of here and bolt the door after her."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing a richly ornamented robe, for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornamented robe she was wearing. She put her hand on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Her brother Absalom said to her, "Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet now, my sister; he is your brother. Don't take this thing to heart." And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom's house, a desolate woman.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When King David heard all this, he was furious.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Two years later, when Absalom's sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king's sons to come there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Absalom went to the king and said, "Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his officials please join me?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"No, my son," the king replied. "All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you." Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go, but gave him his blessing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us." The king asked him, "Why should he go with you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king's sons.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Absalom ordered his men, "Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you, 'Strike Amnon down,' then kill him. Don't be afraid. Have not I given you this order? Be strong and brave."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">So Absalom's men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king's sons got up, mounted their mules and fled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">While they were on their way, the report came to David: "Absalom has struck down all the king's sons; not one of them is left."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">The king stood up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, "My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom's expressed intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king's sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the hill. The watchman went and told the king, "I see men in the direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Jonadab said to the king, "See, the king's sons are here; it has happened just as your servant said."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">As he finished speaking, the king's sons came in, wailing loudly. The king, too, and all his servants wept very bitterly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But King David mourned for his son every day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">And the spirit of the king longed to go to Absalom, for he was consoled concerning Amnon's death.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
<VERS vnumber="1">Joab son of Zeruiah knew that the king's heart longed for Absalom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So Joab sent someone to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there. He said to her, "Pretend you are in mourning. Dress in mourning clothes, and don't use any cosmetic lotions. Act like a woman who has spent many days grieving for the dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then go to the king and speak these words to him." And Joab put the words in her mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When the woman from Tekoa went to the king, she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honor, and she said, "Help me, O king!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The king asked her, "What is troubling you?" She said, "I am indeed a widow; my husband is dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">I your servant had two sons. They got into a fight with each other in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant; they say, 'Hand over the one who struck his brother down, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed; then we will get rid of the heir as well.' They would put out the only burning coal I have left, leaving my husband neither name nor descendant on the face of the earth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The king said to the woman, "Go home, and I will issue an order in your behalf."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But the woman from Tekoa said to him, "My lord the king, let the blame rest on me and on my father's family, and let the king and his throne be without guilt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The king replied, "If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he will not bother you again."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">She said, "Then let the king invoke the LORD his God to prevent the avenger of blood from adding to the destruction, so that my son will not be destroyed.As surely as the LORD lives," he said, "not one hair of your son's head will fall to the ground."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then the woman said, "Let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.Speak," he replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The woman said, "Why then have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict himself, for the king has not brought back his banished son?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be recovered, so we must die. But God does not take away life; instead, he devises ways so that a banished person may not remain estranged from him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"And now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought, 'I will speak to the king; perhaps he will do what his servant asks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Perhaps the king will agree to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who is trying to cut off both me and my son from the inheritance God gave us.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"And now your servant says, 'May the word of my lord the king bring me rest, for my lord the king is like an angel of God in discerning good and evil. May the LORD your God be with you.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then the king said to the woman, "Do not keep from me the answer to what I am going to ask you.Let my lord the king speak," the woman said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The king asked, "Isn't the hand of Joab with you in all this?" The woman answered, "As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king says. Yes, it was your servant Joab who instructed me to do this and who put all these words into the mouth of your servant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Your servant Joab did this to change the present situation. My lord has wisdom like that of an angel of God-he knows everything that happens in the land."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The king said to Joab, "Very well, I will do it. Go, bring back the young man Absalom."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Joab fell with his face to the ground to pay him honor, and he blessed the king. Joab said, "Today your servant knows that he has found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, because the king has granted his servant's request."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">But the king said, "He must go to his own house; he must not see my face." So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the face of the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">In all Israel there was not a man so highly praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the top of his head to the sole of his foot there was no blemish in him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Whenever he cut the hair of his head-he used to cut his hair from time to time when it became too heavy for him-he would weigh it, and its weight was two hundred shekels by the royal standard.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Three sons and a daughter were born to Absalom. The daughter's name was Tamar, and she became a beautiful woman.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king's face.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Then Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. So he sent a second time, but he refused to come.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then he said to his servants, "Look, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire." So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Then Joab did go to Absalom's house and he said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Absalom said to Joab, "Look, I sent word to you and said, 'Come here so I can send you to the king to ask, "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there!"' Now then, I want to see the king's face, and if I am guilty of anything, let him put me to death."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">So Joab went to the king and told him this. Then the king summoned Absalom, and he came in and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the course of time, Absalom provided himself with a chariot and horses and with fifty men to run ahead of him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He would get up early and stand by the side of the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone came with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out to him, "What town are you from?" He would answer, "Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then Absalom would say to him, "Look, your claims are valid and proper, but there is no representative of the king to hear you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And Absalom would add, "If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a complaint or case could come to me and I would see that he gets justice."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Also, whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him and kiss him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Absalom behaved in this way toward all the Israelites who came to the king asking for justice, and so he stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">At the end of four years, Absalom said to the king, "Let me go to Hebron and fulfill a vow I made to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">While your servant was living at Geshur in Aram, I made this vow: 'If the LORD takes me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the LORD in Hebron. '"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The king said to him, "Go in peace." So he went to Hebron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel to say, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets, then say, 'Absalom is king in Hebron.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Two hundred men from Jerusalem had accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and went quite innocently, knowing nothing about the matter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, to come from Giloh, his hometown. And so the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom's following kept on increasing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">A messenger came and told David, "The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, "Come! We must flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom. We must leave immediately, or he will move quickly to overtake us and bring ruin upon us and put the city to the sword."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The king's officials answered him, "Your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king chooses."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The king set out, with his entire household following him; but he left ten concubines to take care of the palace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So the king set out, with all the people following him, and they halted at a place some distance away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">All his men marched past him, along with all the Kerethites and Pelethites; and all the six hundred Gittites who had accompanied him from Gath marched before the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why should you come along with us? Go back and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner, an exile from your homeland.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">You came only yesterday. And today shall I make you wander about with us, when I do not know where I am going? Go back, and take your countrymen. May kindness and faithfulness be with you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But Ittai replied to the king, "As surely as the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">David said to Ittai, "Go ahead, march on." So Ittai the Gittite marched on with all his men and the families that were with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people moved on toward the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Zadok was there, too, and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then the king said to Zadok, "Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the LORD's eyes, he will bring me back and let me see it and his dwelling place again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">But if he says, 'I am not pleased with you,' then I am ready; let him do to me whatever seems good to him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The king also said to Zadok the priest, "Aren't you a seer? Go back to the city in peace, with your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan son of Abiathar. You and Abiathar take your two sons with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">I will wait at the fords in the desert until word comes from you to inform me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">But David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went; his head was covered and he was barefoot. All the people with him covered their heads too and were weeping as they went up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Now David had been told, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." So David prayed, "O LORD, turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">When David arrived at the summit, where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him, his robe torn and dust on his head.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">David said to him, "If you go with me, you will be a burden to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; I was your father's servant in the past, but now I will be your servant,' then you can help me by frustrating Ahithophel's advice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Won't the priests Zadok and Abiathar be there with you? Tell them anything you hear in the king's palace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with anything you hear."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">So David's friend Hushai arrived at Jerusalem as Absalom was entering the city.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
<VERS vnumber="1">When David had gone a short distance beyond the summit, there was Ziba, the steward of Mephibosheth, waiting to meet him. He had a string of donkeys saddled and loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred cakes of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs and a skin of wine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The king asked Ziba, "Why have you brought these?" Ziba answered, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the desert."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The king then asked, "Where is your master's grandson?" Ziba said to him, "He is staying in Jerusalem, because he thinks, 'Today the house of Israel will give me back my grandfather's kingdom.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the king said to Ziba, "All that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.I humbly bow," Ziba said. "May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the same clan as Saul's family came out from there. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and he cursed as he came out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He pelted David and all the king's officials with stones, though all the troops and the special guard were on David's right and left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">As he cursed, Shimei said, "Get out, get out, you man of blood, you scoundrel!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The LORD has repaid you for all the blood you shed in the household of Saul, in whose place you have reigned. The LORD has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom. You have come to ruin because you are a man of blood!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But the king said, "What do you and I have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD said to him, 'Curse David,' who can ask, 'Why do you do this?'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">David then said to Abishai and all his officials, "My son, who is of my own flesh, is trying to take my life. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the LORD has told him to.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">It may be that the LORD will see my distress and repay me with good for the cursing I am receiving today."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So David and his men continued along the road while Shimei was going along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went and throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted. And there he refreshed himself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Meanwhile, Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then Hushai the Arkite, David's friend, went to Absalom and said to him, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Absalom asked Hushai, "Is this the love you show your friend? Why didn't you go with your friend?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Hushai said to Absalom, "No, the one chosen by the LORD, by these people, and by all the men of Israel-his I will be, and I will remain with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve the son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give us your advice. What should we do?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Ahithophel answered, "Lie with your father's concubines whom he left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench in your father's nostrils, and the hands of everyone with you will be strengthened."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he lay with his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Now in those days the advice Ahithophel gave was like that of one who inquires of God. That was how both David and Absalom regarded all of Ahithophel's advice.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
<VERS vnumber="1">Ahithophel said to Absalom, "I would choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I would attack him while he is weary and weak. I would strike him with terror, and then all the people with him will flee. I would strike down only the king</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and bring all the people back to you. The death of the man you seek will mean the return of all; all the people will be unharmed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But Absalom said, "Summon also Hushai the Arkite, so we can hear what he has to say."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When Hushai came to him, Absalom said, "Ahithophel has given this advice. Should we do what he says? If not, give us your opinion."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Hushai replied to Absalom, "The advice Ahithophel has given is not good this time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">You know your father and his men; they are fighters, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Besides, your father is an experienced fighter; he will not spend the night with the troops.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Even now, he is hidden in a cave or some other place. If he should attack your troops first, whoever hears about it will say, 'There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then even the bravest soldier, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a fighter and that those with him are brave.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"So I advise you: Let all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba-as numerous as the sand on the seashore-be gathered to you, with you yourself leading them into battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then we will attack him wherever he may be found, and we will fall on him as dew settles on the ground. Neither he nor any of his men will be left alive.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley until not even a piece of it can be found."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than that of Ahithophel." For the LORD had determined to frustrate the good advice of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, "Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel to do such and such, but I have advised them to do so and so.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Now send a message immediately and tell David, 'Do not spend the night at the fords in the desert; cross over without fail, or the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel. A servant girl was to go and inform them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they could not risk being seen entering the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So the two of them left quickly and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">His wife took a covering and spread it out over the opening of the well and scattered grain over it. No one knew anything about it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">When Absalom's men came to the woman at the house, they asked, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" The woman answered them, "They crossed over the brook." The men searched but found no one, so they returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">After the men had gone, the two climbed out of the well and went to inform King David. They said to him, "Set out and cross the river at once; Ahithophel has advised such and such against you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So David and all the people with him set out and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, no one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his house in order and then hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father's tomb.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Jether, an Israelite who had married Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The Israelites and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Makir son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">brought bedding and bowls and articles of pottery. They also brought wheat and barley, flour and roasted grain, beans and lentils,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">honey and curds, sheep, and cheese from cows' milk for David and his people to eat. For they said, "The people have become hungry and tired and thirsty in the desert."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
<VERS vnumber="1">David mustered the men who were with him and appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">David sent the troops out-a third under the command of Joab, a third under Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The king told the troops, "I myself will surely march out with you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But the men said, "You must not go out; if we are forced to flee, they won't care about us. Even if half of us die, they won't care; but you are worth ten thousand of us. It would be better now for you to give us support from the city."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The king answered, "I will do whatever seems best to you." So the king stood beside the gate while all the men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The king commanded Joab, Abishai and Ittai, "Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake." And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The army marched into the field to fight Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">There the army of Israel was defeated by David's men, and the casualties that day were great-twenty thousand men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and the forest claimed more lives that day than the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Now Absalom happened to meet David's men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom's head got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When one of the men saw this, he told Joab, "I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Joab said to the man who had told him this, "What! You saw him? Why didn't you strike him to the ground right there? Then I would have had to give you ten shekels of silver and a warrior's belt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But the man replied, "Even if a thousand shekels were weighed out into my hands, I would not lift my hand against the king's son. In our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, 'Protect the young man Absalom for my sake. '</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And if I had put my life in jeopardy -and nothing is hidden from the king-you would have kept your distance from me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Joab said, "I'm not going to wait like this for you." So he took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absalom's heart while Absalom was still alive in the oak tree.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And ten of Joab's armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him and killed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops stopped pursuing Israel, for Joab halted them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They took Absalom, threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up a large heap of rocks over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled to their homes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King's Valley as a monument to himself, for he thought, "I have no son to carry on the memory of my name." He named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom's Monument to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, "Let me run and take the news to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"You are not the one to take the news today," Joab told him. "You may take the news another time, but you must not do so today, because the king's son is dead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Joab said to a Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen." The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Ahimaaz son of Zadok again said to Joab, "Come what may, please let me run behind the Cushite." But Joab replied, "My son, why do you want to go? You don't have any news that will bring you a reward."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">He said, "Come what may, I want to run." So Joab said, "Run!" Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked out, he saw a man running alone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The watchman called out to the king and reported it. The king said, "If he is alone, he must have good news." And the man came closer and closer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then the watchman saw another man running, and he called down to the gatekeeper, "Look, another man running alone!" The king said, "He must be bringing good news, too."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The watchman said, "It seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.He's a good man," the king said. "He comes with good news."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, "All is well!" He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said, "Praise be to the LORD your God! He has delivered up the men who lifted their hands against my lord the king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">The king asked, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Ahimaaz answered, "I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king's servant and me, your servant, but I don't know what it was."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">The king said, "Stand aside and wait here." So he stepped aside and stood there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Then the Cushite arrived and said, "My lord the king, hear the good news! The LORD has delivered you today from all who rose up against you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The king asked the Cushite, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" The Cushite replied, "May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: "O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you-O Absalom, my son, my son!"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
<VERS vnumber="1">Joab was told, "The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And for the whole army the victory that day was turned into mourning, because on that day the troops heard it said, "The king is grieving for his son."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The men stole into the city that day as men steal in who are ashamed when they flee from battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The king covered his face and cried aloud, "O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, "Today you have humiliated all your men, who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">You love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that the commanders and their men mean nothing to you. I see that you would be pleased if Absalom were alive today and all of us were dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now go out and encourage your men. I swear by the LORD that if you don't go out, not a man will be left with you by nightfall. This will be worse for you than all the calamities that have come upon you from your youth till now."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So the king got up and took his seat in the gateway. When the men were told, "The king is sitting in the gateway," they all came before him. Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled to their homes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Throughout the tribes of Israel, the people were all arguing with each other, saying, "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies; he is the one who rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. But now he has fled the country because of Absalom;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">and Absalom, whom we anointed to rule over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: "Ask the elders of Judah, 'Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace, since what is being said throughout Israel has reached the king at his quarters?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">You are my brothers, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to bring back the king?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And say to Amasa, 'Are you not my own flesh and blood? May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if from now on you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He won over the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man. They sent word to the king, "Return, you and all your men."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then the king returned and went as far as the Jordan. Now the men of Judah had come to Gilgal to go out and meet the king and bring him across the Jordan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">With him were a thousand Benjamites, along with Ziba, the steward of Saul's household, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the Jordan, where the king was.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">They crossed at the ford to take the king's household over and to do whatever he wished. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell prostrate before the king</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">and said to him, "May my lord not hold me guilty. Do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">For I your servant know that I have sinned, but today I have come here as the first of the whole house of Joseph to come down and meet my lord the king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, "Shouldn't Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the LORD's anointed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">David replied, "What do you and I have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? This day you have become my adversaries! Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Do I not know that today I am king over Israel?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So the king said to Shimei, "You shall not die." And the king promised him on oath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, "Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He said, "My lord the king, since I your servant am lame, I said, 'I will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I can go with the king.' But Ziba my servant betrayed me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like an angel of God; so do whatever pleases you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">All my grandfather's descendants deserved nothing but death from my lord the king, but you gave your servant a place among those who eat at your table. So what right do I have to make any more appeals to the king?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">The king said to him, "Why say more? I order you and Ziba to divide the fields."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let him take everything, now that my lord the king has arrived home safely."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and to send him on his way from there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Now Barzillai was a very old man, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">The king said to Barzillai, "Cross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">But Barzillai answered the king, "How many more years will I live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">I am now eighty years old. Can I tell the difference between what is good and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of men and women singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me in this way?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever pleases you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">The king said, "Kimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever pleases you. And anything you desire from me I will do for you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and gave him his blessing, and Barzillai returned to his home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham crossed with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel had taken the king over.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Soon all the men of Israel were coming to the king and saying to him, "Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal the king away and bring him and his household across the Jordan, together with all his men?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, "We did this because the king is closely related to us. Why are you angry about it? Have we eaten any of the king's provisions? Have we taken anything for ourselves?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, "We have ten shares in the king; and besides, we have a greater claim on David than you have. So why do you treat us with contempt? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?" But the men of Judah responded even more harshly than the men of Israel.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now a troublemaker named Sheba son of Bicri, a Benjamite, happened to be there. He sounded the trumpet and shouted, "We have no share in David, no part in Jesse's son! Every man to his tent, O Israel!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bicri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace and put them in a house under guard. He provided for them, but did not lie with them. They were kept in confinement till the day of their death, living as widows.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the king said to Amasa, "Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days, and be here yourself."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But when Amasa went to summon Judah, he took longer than the time the king had set for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba son of Bicri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your master's men and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and escape from us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So Joab's men and the Kerethites and Pelethites and all the mighty warriors went out under the command of Abishai. They marched out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">While they were at the great rock in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing his military tunic, and strapped over it at his waist was a belt with a dagger in its sheath. As he stepped forward, it dropped out of its sheath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Joab said to Amasa, "How are you, my brother?" Then Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Amasa was not on his guard against the dagger in Joab's hand, and Joab plunged it into his belly, and his intestines spilled out on the ground. Without being stabbed again, Amasa died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bicri.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">One of Joab's men stood beside Amasa and said, "Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road, and the man saw that all the troops came to a halt there. When he realized that everyone who came up to Amasa stopped, he dragged him from the road into a field and threw a garment over him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">After Amasa had been removed from the road, all the men went on with Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel Beth Maacah and through the entire region of the Berites, who gathered together and followed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">All the troops with Joab came and besieged Sheba in Abel Beth Maacah. They built a siege ramp up to the city, and it stood against the outer fortifications. While they were battering the wall to bring it down,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">a wise woman called from the city, "Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here so I can speak to him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He went toward her, and she asked, "Are you Joab?I am," he answered. She said, "Listen to what your servant has to say.I'm listening," he said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">She continued, "Long ago they used to say, 'Get your answer at Abel,' and that settled it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">We are the peaceful and faithful in Israel. You are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow up the LORD's inheritance?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"Far be it from me!" Joab replied, "Far be it from me to swallow up or destroy!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">That is not the case. A man named Sheba son of Bicri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Hand over this one man, and I'll withdraw from the city." The woman said to Joab, "His head will be thrown to you from the wall."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bicri and threw it to Joab. So he sounded the trumpet, and his men dispersed from the city, each returning to his home. And Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Joab was over Israel's entire army; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Adoniram was in charge of forced labor; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Sheva was secretary; Zadok and Abiathar were priests;</VERS>

</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
<VERS vnumber="1">During the reign of David, there was a famine for three successive years; so David sought the face of the LORD. The LORD said, "It is on account of Saul and his blood-stained house; it is because he put the Gibeonites to death."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">David asked the Gibeonites, "What shall I do for you? How shall I make amends so that you will bless the LORD's inheritance?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The Gibeonites answered him, "We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death.What do you want me to do for you?" David asked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">They answered the king, "As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and exposed before the LORD at Gibeah of Saul-the Lord 's chosen one." So the king said, "I will give them to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the LORD between David and Jonathan son of Saul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah's daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne to Saul, together with the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who killed and exposed them on a hill before the LORD. All seven of them fell together; they were put to death during the first days of the harvest, just as the barley harvest was beginning.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Rizpah daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest till the rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies, she did not let the birds of the air touch them by day or the wild animals by night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When David was told what Aiah's daughter Rizpah, Saul's concubine, had done,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">he went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead. (They had taken them secretly from the public square at Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them after they struck Saul down on Gilboa.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there, and the bones of those who had been killed and exposed were gathered up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the tomb of Saul's father Kish, at Zela in Benjamin, and did everything the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer in behalf of the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. David went down with his men to fight against the Philistines, and he became exhausted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">And Ishbi-Benob, one of the descendants of Rapha, whose bronze spearhead weighed three hundred shekels and who was armed with a new sword, said he would kill David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David's rescue; he struck the Philistine down and killed him. Then David's men swore to him, saying, "Never again will you go out with us to battle, so that the lamp of Israel will not be extinguished."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">In the course of time, there was another battle with the Philistines, at Gob. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of Rapha.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">In another battle with the Philistines at Gob, Elhanan son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver's rod.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot-twenty-four in all. He also was descended from Rapha.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
<VERS vnumber="1">David sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He said: "The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="5">"The waves of death swirled about me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The cords of the grave coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">In my distress I called to the LORD; I called out to my God. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came to his ears.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"The earth trembled and quaked, the foundations of the heavens shook; they trembled because he was angry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He made darkness his canopy around him- the dark rain clouds of the sky.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Out of the brightness of his presence bolts of lightning blazed forth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He shot arrows and scattered the enemies, bolts of lightning and routed them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of breath from his nostrils.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="21">"The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="23">All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="41">You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">They cried for help, but there was no one to save them- to the LORD, but he did not answer.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
<VERS vnumber="1">These are the last words of David: "The oracle of David son of Jesse, the oracle of the man exalted by the Most High, the man anointed by the God of Jacob, Israel's singer of songs:</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="5">"Is not my house right with God? Has he not made with me an everlasting covenant, arranged and secured in every part? Will he not bring to fruition my salvation and grant me my every desire?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But evil men are all to be cast aside like thorns, which are not gathered with the hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Whoever touches thorns uses a tool of iron or the shaft of a spear; they are burned up where they lie."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">These are the names of David's mighty men: Josheb-Basshebeth, a Tahkemonite, was chief of the Three; he raised his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty men, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim for battle. Then the men of Israel retreated,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">but he stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. The troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel's troops fled from them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field. He defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">During harvest time, three of the thirty chief men came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this!" he said. "Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?" And David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Abishai the brother of Joab son of Zeruiah was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="21">And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
<VERS vnumber="1">Again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, "Go and take a census of Israel and Judah."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So the king said to Joab and the army commanders with him, "Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and enroll the fighting men, so that I may know how many there are."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But Joab replied to the king, "May the LORD your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The king's word, however, overruled Joab and the army commanders; so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">After crossing the Jordan, they camped near Aroer, south of the town in the gorge, and then went through Gad and on to Jazer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">They went to Gilead and the region of Tahtim Hodshi, and on to Dan Jaan and around toward Sidon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then they went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to Beersheba in the Negev of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">After they had gone through the entire land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king: In Israel there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword, and in Judah five hundred thousand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, O LORD, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Before David got up the next morning, the word of the LORD had come to Gad the prophet, David's seer:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"Go and tell David, 'This is what the LORD says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So Gad went to David and said to him, "Shall there come upon you three years of famine in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague in your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So the LORD sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was afflicting the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he said to the LORD, "I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? Let your hand fall upon me and my family."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">On that day Gad went to David and said to him, "Go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">So David went up, as the LORD had commanded through Gad.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">When Araunah looked and saw the king and his men coming toward him, he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?To buy your threshing floor," David answered, "so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take whatever pleases him and offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">O king, Araunah gives all this to the king." Araunah also said to him, "May the LORD your God accept you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">But the king replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the LORD answered prayer in behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="2">So his servants said to him, "Let us look for a young virgin to attend the king and take care of him. She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The girl was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no intimate relations with her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Now Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, put himself forward and said, "I will be king." So he got chariots and horses ready, with fifty men to run ahead of him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">(His father had never interfered with him by asking, "Why do you behave as you do?" He was also very handsome and was born next after Absalom.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they gave him their support.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei and Rei and David's special guard did not join Adonijah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Adonijah then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah who were royal officials,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the special guard or his brother Solomon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, "Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king without our lord David's knowing it?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Go in to King David and say to him, 'My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant: "Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne"? Why then has Adonijah become king?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and confirm what you have said."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room, where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Bathsheba bowed low and knelt before the king. "What is it you want?" the king asked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">She said to him, "My lord, you yourself swore to me your servant by the LORD your God: 'Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But now Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know about it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">And they told the king, "Nathan the prophet is here." So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Nathan said, "Have you, my lord the king, declared that Adonijah shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">But me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he did not invite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then King David said, "Call in Bathsheba." So she came into the king's presence and stood before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">The king then took an oath: "As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">I will surely carry out today what I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel: Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Then Bathsheba bowed low with her face to the ground and, kneeling before the king, said, "May my lord King David live forever!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">King David said, "Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada." When they came before the king,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">he said to them: "Take your lord's servants with you and set Solomon my son on my own mule and take him down to Gihon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">There have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, 'Long live King Solomon!'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Then you are to go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, "Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so declare it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">As the LORD was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and put Solomon on King David's mule and escorted him to Gihon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted, "Long live King Solomon!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">And all the people went up after him, playing flutes and rejoicing greatly, so that the ground shook with the sound.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, "What's the meaning of all the noise in the city?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, "Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">"Not at all!" Jonathan answered. "Our lord King David has made Solomon king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king's mule,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That's the noise you hear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make Solomon's name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!' And the king bowed in worship on his bed</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">and said, 'Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">At this, all Adonijah's guests rose in alarm and dispersed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">Then Solomon was told, "Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, 'Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="52">Solomon replied, "If he shows himself to be a worthy man, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="53">Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And Adonijah came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said, "Go to your home."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"I am about to go the way of all the earth," he said. "So be strong, show yourself a man,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and observe what the LORD your God requires: Walk in his ways, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and requirements, as written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">and that the LORD may keep his promise to me: 'If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me-what he did to the two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"And remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD: 'I will not put you to death by the sword.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He had reigned forty years over Israel-seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. Bathsheba asked him, "Do you come peacefully?" He answered, "Yes, peacefully."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then he added, "I have something to say to you.You may say it," she replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"As you know," he said, "the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me.You may make it," she said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So he continued, "Please ask King Solomon-he will not refuse you-to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"Very well," Bathsheba replied, "I will speak to the king for you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king's mother, and she sat down at his right hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"I have one small request to make of you," she said. "Do not refuse me." The king replied, "Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So she said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">King Solomon answered his mother, "Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him-after all, he is my older brother-yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">And now, as surely as the LORD lives-he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised-Adonijah shall be put to death today!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">To Abiathar the priest the king said, "Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign LORD before my father David and shared all my father's hardships."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD, fulfilling the word the LORD had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, "Go, strike him down!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">So Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, "The king says, 'Come out!'" But he answered, "No, I will die here." Benaiah reported to the king, "This is how Joab answered me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Then the king commanded Benaiah, "Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my father's house of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The LORD will repay him for the blood he shed, because without the knowledge of my father David he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them-Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army-were better men and more upright than he.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the LORD's peace forever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried on his own land in the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab's position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Shimei answered the king, "What you say is good. Your servant will do as my lord the king has said." And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">But three years later, two of Shimei's slaves ran off to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, "Your slaves are in Gath."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">At this, he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">the king summoned Shimei and said to him, "Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you, 'On the day you leave to go anywhere else, you can be sure you will die'? At that time you said to me, 'What you say is good. I will obey.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">Why then did you not keep your oath to the LORD and obey the command I gave you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">The king also said to Shimei, "You know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David. Now the LORD will repay you for your wrongdoing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">But King Solomon will be blessed, and David's throne will remain secure before the LORD forever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">Then the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down and killed him. The kingdom was now firmly established in Solomon's hands.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt and married his daughter. He brought her to the City of David until he finished building his palace and the temple of the LORD, and the wall around Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The people, however, were still sacrificing at the high places, because a temple had not yet been built for the Name of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Solomon showed his love for the LORD by walking according to the statutes of his father David, except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices, for that was the most important high place, and Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon during the night in a dream, and God said, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Solomon answered, "You have shown great kindness to your servant, my father David, because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart. You have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on his throne this very day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David. But I am only a little child and do not know how to carry out my duties.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Your servant is here among the people you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to count or number.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong. For who is able to govern this great people of yours?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So God said to him, "Since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself, nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Moreover, I will give you what you have not asked for-both riches and honor-so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">And if you walk in my ways and obey my statutes and commands as David your father did, I will give you a long life."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Solomon awoke-and he realized it had been a dream. He returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord's covenant and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he gave a feast for all his court.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Now two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">One of them said, "My lord, this woman and I live in the same house. I had a baby while she was there with me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The third day after my child was born, this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there was no one in the house but the two of us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"During the night this woman's son died because she lay on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I your servant was asleep. She put him by her breast and put her dead son by my breast.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The next morning, I got up to nurse my son-and he was dead! But when I looked at him closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn't the son I had borne."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The other woman said, "No! The living one is my son; the dead one is yours." But the first one insisted, "No! The dead one is yours; the living one is mine." And so they argued before the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The king said, "This one says, 'My son is alive and your son is dead,' while that one says, 'No! Your son is dead and mine is alive.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then the king said, "Bring me a sword." So they brought a sword for the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">He then gave an order: "Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The woman whose son was alive was filled with compassion for her son and said to the king, "Please, my lord, give her the living baby! Don't kill him!" But the other said, "Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then the king gave his ruling: "Give the living baby to the first woman. Do not kill him; she is his mother."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">When all Israel heard the verdict the king had given, they held the king in awe, because they saw that he had wisdom from God to administer justice.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">So King Solomon ruled over all Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And these were his chief officials: Azariah son of Zadok-the priest;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Elihoreph and Ahijah, sons of Shisha-secretaries; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud-recorder;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Benaiah son of Jehoiada-commander in chief; Zadok and Abiathar-priests;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Azariah son of Nathan-in charge of the district officers; Zabud son of Nathan-a priest and personal adviser to the king;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Ahishar-in charge of the palace; Adoniram son of Abda-in charge of forced labor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Solomon also had twelve district governors over all Israel, who supplied provisions for the king and the royal household. Each one had to provide supplies for one month in the year.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">These are their names: Ben-Hur-in the hill country of Ephraim;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Ben-Deker-in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh and Elon Bethhanan;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Ben-Hesed-in Arubboth (Socoh and all the land of Hepher were his);</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Ben-Abinadab-in Naphoth Dor (he was married to Taphath daughter of Solomon);</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Baana son of Ahilud-in Taanach and Megiddo, and in all of Beth Shan next to Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth Shan to Abel Meholah across to Jokmeam;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Ben-Geber-in Ramoth Gilead (the settlements of Jair son of Manasseh in Gilead were his, as well as the district of Argob in Bashan and its sixty large walled cities with bronze gate bars);</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Ahinadab son of Iddo-in Mahanaim;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Ahimaaz-in Naphtali (he had married Basemath daughter of Solomon);</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Baana son of Hushai-in Asher and in Aloth;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Jehoshaphat son of Paruah-in Issachar;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Shimei son of Ela-in Benjamin;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Geber son of Uri-in Gilead (the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and the country of Og king of Bashan). He was the only governor over the district.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore; they ate, they drank and they were happy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These countries brought tribute and were Solomon's subjects all his life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Solomon's daily provisions were thirty cors of fine flour and sixty cors of meal,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">ten head of stall-fed cattle, twenty of pasture-fed cattle and a hundred sheep and goats, as well as deer, gazelles, roebucks and choice fowl.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">For he ruled over all the kingdoms west of the River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, and had peace on all sides.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">During Solomon's lifetime Judah and Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, lived in safety, each man under his own vine and fig tree.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Solomon had four thousand stalls for chariot horses, and twelve thousand horses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The district officers, each in his month, supplied provisions for King Solomon and all who came to the king's table. They saw to it that nothing was lacking.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">They also brought to the proper place their quotas of barley and straw for the chariot horses and the other horses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">God gave Solomon wisdom and very great insight, and a breadth of understanding as measureless as the sand on the seashore.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Solomon's wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the men of the East, and greater than all the wisdom of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">He was wiser than any other man, including Ethan the Ezrahite-wiser than Heman, Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">He spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs numbered a thousand and five.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">He described plant life, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of walls. He also taught about animals and birds, reptiles and fish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Men of all nations came to listen to Solomon's wisdom, sent by all the kings of the world, who had heard of his wisdom.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Hiram king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king to succeed his father David, he sent his envoys to Solomon, because he had always been on friendly terms with David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Solomon sent back this message to Hiram:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"You know that because of the wars waged against my father David from all sides, he could not build a temple for the Name of the LORD his God until the LORD put his enemies under his feet.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, and there is no adversary or disaster.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I intend, therefore, to build a temple for the Name of the LORD my God, as the LORD told my father David, when he said, 'Your son whom I will put on the throne in your place will build the temple for my Name.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"So give orders that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. My men will work with yours, and I will pay you for your men whatever wages you set. You know that we have no one so skilled in felling timber as the Sidonians."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When Hiram heard Solomon's message, he was greatly pleased and said, "Praise be to the LORD today, for he has given David a wise son to rule over this great nation."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So Hiram sent word to Solomon: "I have received the message you sent me and will do all you want in providing the cedar and pine logs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">My men will haul them down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will float them in rafts by sea to the place you specify. There I will separate them and you can take them away. And you are to grant my wish by providing food for my royal household."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">In this way Hiram kept Solomon supplied with all the cedar and pine logs he wanted,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">and Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his household, in addition to twenty thousand baths, of pressed olive oil. Solomon continued to do this for Hiram year after year.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The LORD gave Solomon wisdom, just as he had promised him. There were peaceful relations between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">King Solomon conscripted laborers from all Israel-thirty thousand men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He sent them off to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand a month, so that they spent one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Solomon had seventy thousand carriers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hills,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">as well as thirty-three hundred foremen who supervised the project and directed the workmen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">At the king's command they removed from the quarry large blocks of quality stone to provide a foundation of dressed stone for the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The craftsmen of Solomon and Hiram and the men of Gebal cut and prepared the timber and stone for the building of the temple.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites had come out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, the second month, he began to build the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The temple that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty wide and thirty high.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple, that is twenty cubits, and projected ten cubits from the front of the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He made narrow clerestory windows in the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Against the walls of the main hall and inner sanctuary he built a structure around the building, in which there were side rooms.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The lowest floor was five cubits wide, the middle floor six cubits and the third floor seven. He made offset ledges around the outside of the temple so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The entrance to the lowest floor was on the south side of the temple; a stairway led up to the middle level and from there to the third.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So he built the temple and completed it, roofing it with beams and cedar planks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And he built the side rooms all along the temple. The height of each was five cubits, and they were attached to the temple by beams of cedar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The word of the LORD came to Solomon:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"As for this temple you are building, if you follow my decrees, carry out my regulations and keep all my commands and obey them, I will fulfill through you the promise I gave to David your father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So Solomon built the temple and completed it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He lined its interior walls with cedar boards, paneling them from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and covered the floor of the temple with planks of pine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He partitioned off twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The main hall in front of this room was forty cubits long.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; no stone was to be seen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty wide and twenty high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So he overlaid the whole interior with gold. He also overlaid with gold the altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">In the inner sanctuary he made a pair of cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing five cubits-ten cubits from wing tip to wing tip.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The second cherub also measured ten cubits, for the two cherubim were identical in size and shape.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The height of each cherub was ten cubits.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple, with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the other touched the other wall, and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">He overlaid the cherubim with gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">On the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer rooms, he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">He also covered the floors of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood with five-sided jambs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">And on the two olive wood doors he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with beaten gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">In the same way he made four-sided jambs of olive wood for the entrance to the main hall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">He also made two pine doors, each having two leaves that turned in sockets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">He carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">And he built the inner courtyard of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">The foundation of the temple of the LORD was laid in the fourth year, in the month of Ziv.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">In the eleventh year in the month of Bul, the eighth month, the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications. He had spent seven years building it.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">It took Solomon thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of his palace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty wide and thirty high, with four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">It was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns-forty-five beams, fifteen to a row.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Its windows were placed high in sets of three, facing each other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">All the doorways had rectangular frames; they were in the front part in sets of three, facing each other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide. In front of it was a portico, and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He built the throne hall, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge, and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And the palace in which he was to live, set farther back, was similar in design. Solomon also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">All these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to size and trimmed with a saw on their inner and outer faces.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten cubits and some eight.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Above were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the LORD with its portico.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">King Solomon sent to Tyre and brought Huram,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and whose father was a man of Tyre and a craftsman in bronze. Huram was highly skilled and experienced in all kinds of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and did all the work assigned to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits around, by line.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was five cubits high.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">A network of interwoven chains festooned the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each capital.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He made pomegranates in two rows encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars. He did the same for each capital.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies, four cubits high.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">On the capitals of both pillars, above the bowl-shaped part next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He erected the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jakin and the one to the north Boaz.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The capitals on top were in the shape of lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Below the rim, gourds encircled it-ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">He also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long, four wide and three high.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">This is how the stands were made: They had side panels attached to uprights.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">On the panels between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim-and on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast with wreaths on each side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit deep. This opening was round, and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half. Around its opening there was engraving. The panels of the stands were square, not round.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">The wheels were made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all of cast metal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Each stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the stand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">He engraved cherubim, lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels, in every available space, with wreaths all around.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">He then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths and measuring four cubits across, one basin to go on each of the ten stands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">He also made the basins and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished all the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of the LORD:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">the ten stands with their ten basins;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">the pots, shovels and sprinkling bowls. All these objects that Huram made for King Solomon for the temple of the LORD were of burnished bronze.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">Solomon left all these things unweighed, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the LORD's temple: the golden altar; the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">the lampstands of pure gold (five on the right and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary); the gold floral work and lamps and tongs;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room, the Most Holy Place, and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">When all the work King Solomon had done for the temple of the LORD was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated-the silver and gold and the furnishings-and he placed them in the treasuries of the LORD's temple.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then King Solomon summoned into his presence at Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of the LORD's covenant from Zion, the City of David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">All the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the time of the festival in the month of Ethanim, the seventh month.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">and they brought up the ark of the LORD and the Tent of Meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The priests and Levites carried them up,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The priests then brought the ark of the LORD's covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its carrying poles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When the priests withdrew from the Holy Place, the cloud filled the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">And the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled his temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I have indeed built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then he said: "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his own hand has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father David. For he said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">'Since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built for my Name to be there, but I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But the LORD said to my father David, 'Because it was in your heart to build a temple for my Name, you did well to have this in your heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, who is your own flesh and blood-he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"The LORD has kept the promise he made: I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">I have provided a place there for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with our fathers when he brought them out of Egypt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">and said: "O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth below-you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it-as it is today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"Now LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said, 'You shall never fail to have a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons are careful in all they do to walk before me as you have done.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">And now, O God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David my father come true.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">"But will God really dwell on earth? The heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Yet give attention to your servant's prayer and his plea for mercy, O LORD my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">May your eyes be open toward this temple night and day, this place of which you said, 'My Name shall be there,' so that you will hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Hear the supplication of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">"When a man wrongs his neighbor and is required to take an oath and he comes and swears the oath before your altar in this temple,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">then hear from heaven and act. Judge between your servants, condemning the guilty and bringing down on his own head what he has done. Declare the innocent not guilty, and so establish his innocence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">"When your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you, and when they turn back to you and confess your name, praying and making supplication to you in this temple,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land you gave to their fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">"When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and confess your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">"When famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when an enemy besieges them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">and when a prayer or plea is made by any of your people Israel-each one aware of the afflictions of his own heart, and spreading out his hands toward this temple-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive and act; deal with each man according to all he does, since you know his heart (for you alone know the hearts of all men),</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">so that they will fear you all the time they live in the land you gave our fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">"As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your name-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">for men will hear of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm-when he comes and prays toward this temple,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">then hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">"When your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send them, and when they pray to the LORD toward the city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">"When they sin against you-for there is no one who does not sin-and you become angry with them and give them over to the enemy, who takes them captive to his own land, far away or near;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their conquerors and say, 'We have sinned, we have done wrong, we have acted wickedly';</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive, and pray to you toward the land you gave their fathers, toward the city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">then from heaven, your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">And forgive your people, who have sinned against you; forgive all the offenses they have committed against you, and cause their conquerors to show them mercy;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of Egypt, out of that iron-smelting furnace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="52">"May your eyes be open to your servant's plea and to the plea of your people Israel, and may you listen to them whenever they cry out to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="53">For you singled them out from all the nations of the world to be your own inheritance, just as you declared through your servant Moses when you, O Sovereign LORD, brought our fathers out of Egypt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="54">When Solomon had finished all these prayers and supplications to the LORD, he rose from before the altar of the LORD, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="55">He stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="56">"Praise be to the LORD, who has given rest to his people Israel just as he promised. Not one word has failed of all the good promises he gave through his servant Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="57">May the LORD our God be with us as he was with our fathers; may he never leave us nor forsake us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="58">May he turn our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways and to keep the commands, decrees and regulations he gave our fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="59">And may these words of mine, which I have prayed before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, that he may uphold the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel according to each day's need,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="60">so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God and that there is no other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="61">But your hearts must be fully committed to the LORD our God, to live by his decrees and obey his commands, as at this time."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="62">Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="63">Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the LORD: twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="64">On that same day the king consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the LORD, and there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar before the LORD was too small to hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="65">So Solomon observed the festival at that time, and all Israel with him-a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. They celebrated it before the LORD our God for seven days and seven days more, fourteen days in all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="66">On the following day he sent the people away. They blessed the king and then went home, joyful and glad in heart for all the good things the LORD had done for his servant David and his people Israel.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Solomon had finished building the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and had achieved all he had desired to do,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">the LORD appeared to him a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The LORD said to him: "I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me; I have consecrated this temple, which you have built, by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"As for you, if you walk before me in integrity of heart and uprightness, as David your father did, and do all I command and observe my decrees and laws,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father when I said, 'You shall never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"But if you or your sons turn away from me and do not observe the commands and decrees I have given you and go off to serve other gods and worship them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And though this temple is now imposing, all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff and say, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">People will answer, 'Because they have forsaken the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them-that is why the LORD brought all this disaster on them.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built these two buildings-the temple of the LORD and the royal palace-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because Hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and pine and gold he wanted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But when Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?" he asked. And he called them the Land of Cabul, a name they have to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Now Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents of gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Here is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the LORD's temple, his own palace, the supporting terraces, the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">(Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire. He killed its Canaanite inhabitants and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon's wife.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">And Solomon rebuilt Gezer.) He built up Lower Beth Horon,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Baalath, and Tadmor in the desert, within his land,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">as well as all his store cities and the towns for his chariots and for his horses -whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">All the people left from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these peoples were not Israelites),</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">that is, their descendants remaining in the land, whom the Israelites could not exterminate -these Solomon conscripted for his slave labor force, as it is to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But Solomon did not make slaves of any of the Israelites; they were his fighting men, his government officials, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and charioteers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">They were also the chief officials in charge of Solomon's projects-550 officials supervising the men who did the work.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">After Pharaoh's daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he constructed the supporting terraces.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the LORD, burning incense before the LORD along with them, and so fulfilled the temple obligations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">And Hiram sent his men-sailors who knew the sea-to serve in the fleet with Solomon's men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">When the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon and his relation to the name of the LORD, she came to test him with hard questions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Arriving at Jerusalem with a very great caravan-with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones-she came to Solomon and talked with him about all that she had on her mind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon and the palace he had built,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he made at the temple of the LORD, she was overwhelmed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">She said to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told me; in wisdom and wealth you have far exceeded the report I heard.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">How happy your men must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on the throne of Israel. Because of the LORD's eternal love for Israel, he has made you king, to maintain justice and righteousness."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And she gave the king 120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">(Hiram's ships brought gold from Ophir; and from there they brought great cargoes of almugwood and precious stones.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The king used the almugwood to make supports for the temple of the LORD and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. So much almugwood has never been imported or seen since that day.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for, besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">not including the revenues from merchants and traders and from all the Arabian kings and the governors of the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred bekas of gold went into each shield.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, with three minas of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then the king made a great throne inlaid with ivory and overlaid with fine gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The throne had six steps, and its back had a rounded top. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">All King Solomon's goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon's days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The king had a fleet of trading ships at sea along with the ships of Hiram. Once every three years it returned, carrying gold, silver and ivory, and apes and baboons.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The whole world sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Year after year, everyone who came brought a gift-articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons and spices, and horses and mules.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue - the royal merchants purchased them from Kue.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
<VERS vnumber="1">King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh's daughter-Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">They were from nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, "You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods." Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the LORD; he did not follow the LORD completely, as David his father had done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD's command.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So the LORD said to Solomon, "Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then the LORD raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Earlier when David was fighting with Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the dead, had struck down all the men in Edom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Joab and all the Israelites stayed there for six months, until they had destroyed all the men in Edom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But Hadad, still only a boy, fled to Egypt with some Edomite officials who had served his father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">They set out from Midian and went to Paran. Then taking men from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath, whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace. There Genubath lived with Pharaoh's own children.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">While he was in Egypt, Hadad heard that David rested with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Let me go, that I may return to my own country."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country?" Pharaoh asked. "Nothing," Hadad replied, "but do let me go!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">He gathered men around him and became the leader of a band of rebels when David destroyed the forces of Zobah; the rebels went to Damascus, where they settled and took control.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Rezon was Israel's adversary as long as Solomon lived, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile toward Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Also, Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was one of Solomon's officials, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Here is the account of how he rebelled against the king: Solomon had built the supporting terraces and had filled in the gap in the wall of the city of David his father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Now Jeroboam was a man of standing, and when Solomon saw how well the young man did his work, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">About that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh met him on the way, wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone out in the country,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Then he said to Jeroboam, "Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'See, I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon's hand and give you ten tribes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">But for the sake of my servant David and the city of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, he will have one tribe.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">I will do this because they have forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Molech the god of the Ammonites, and have not walked in my ways, nor done what is right in my eyes, nor kept my statutes and laws as David, Solomon's father, did.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">"'But I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon's hand; I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose and who observed my commands and statutes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">I will take the kingdom from his son's hands and give you ten tribes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">I will give one tribe to his son so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put my Name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">However, as for you, I will take you, and you will rule over all that your heart desires; you will be king over Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">If you do whatever I command you and walk in my ways and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and commands, as David my servant did, I will be with you. I will build you a dynasty as enduring as the one I built for David and will give Israel to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">I will humble David's descendants because of this, but not forever.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king, and stayed there until Solomon's death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">As for the other events of Solomon's reign-all he did and the wisdom he displayed-are they not written in the book of the annals of Solomon?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">Then he rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
<VERS vnumber="1">Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all the Israelites had gone there to make him king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Rehoboam answered, "Go away for three days and then come back to me." So the people went away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. "How would you advise me to answer these people?" he asked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They replied, "If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He asked them, "What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The young men who had grown up with him replied, "Tell these people who have said to you, 'Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter'-tell them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, "Come back to me in three days."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The king answered the people harshly. Rejecting the advice given him by the elders,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">he followed the advice of the young men and said, "My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: "What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse's son? To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, O David!" So the Israelites went home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, who was in charge of forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin-a hundred and eighty thousand fighting men-to make war against the house of Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam son of Solomon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But this word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, to the whole house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">'This is what the LORD says: Do not go up to fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.'" So they obeyed the word of the LORD and went home again, as the LORD had ordered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built up Peniel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Jeroboam thought to himself, "The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">One he set up in Bethel, and the other in Dan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">And this thing became a sin; the people went even as far as Dan to worship the one there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people, even though they were not Levites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">He instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival held in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. This he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves he had made. And at Bethel he also installed priests at the high places he had made.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at Bethel. So he instituted the festival for the Israelites and went up to the altar to make offerings.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
<VERS vnumber="1">By the word of the LORD a man of God came from Judah to Bethel, as Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make an offering.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD: "O altar, altar! This is what the LORD says: 'A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David. On you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who now make offerings here, and human bones will be burned on you.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">That same day the man of God gave a sign: "This is the sign the LORD has declared: The altar will be split apart and the ashes on it will be poured out."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar and said, "Seize him!" But the hand he stretched out toward the man shriveled up, so that he could not pull it back.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Also, the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then the king said to the man of God, "Intercede with the LORD your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored." So the man of God interceded with the LORD, and the king's hand was restored and became as it was before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The king said to the man of God, "Come home with me and have something to eat, and I will give you a gift."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But the man of God answered the king, "Even if you were to give me half your possessions, I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water here.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">For I was commanded by the word of the LORD: 'You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel, whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Their father asked them, "Which way did he go?" And his sons showed him which road the man of God from Judah had taken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So he said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." And when they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">and rode after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?I am," he replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So the prophet said to him, "Come home with me and eat."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The man of God said, "I cannot turn back and go with you, nor can I eat bread or drink water with you in this place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I have been told by the word of the LORD: 'You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The old prophet answered, "I too am a prophet, as you are. And an angel said to me by the word of the LORD: 'Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water.'" (But he was lying to him.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">So the man of God returned with him and ate and drank in his house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">While they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the old prophet who had brought him back.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, "This is what the LORD says: 'You have defied the word of the LORD and have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">You came back and ate bread and drank water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink. Therefore your body will not be buried in the tomb of your fathers.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">When the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was thrown down on the road, with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Some people who passed by saw the body thrown down there, with the lion standing beside the body, and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard of it, he said, "It is the man of God who defied the word of the LORD. The LORD has given him over to the lion, which has mauled him and killed him, as the word of the LORD had warned him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The prophet said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me," and they did so.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then he went out and found the body thrown down on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had neither eaten the body nor mauled the donkey.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">So the prophet picked up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they mourned over him and said, "Oh, my brother!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">After burying him, he said to his sons, "When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">For the message he declared by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the towns of Samaria will certainly come true."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Even after this, Jeroboam did not change his evil ways, but once more appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people. Anyone who wanted to become a priest he consecrated for the high places.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">This was the sin of the house of Jeroboam that led to its downfall and to its destruction from the face of the earth.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
<VERS vnumber="1">At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">and Jeroboam said to his wife, "Go, disguise yourself, so you won't be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there-the one who told me I would be king over this people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Take ten loaves of bread with you, some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So Jeroboam's wife did what he said and went to Ahijah's house in Shiloh. Now Ahijah could not see; his sight was gone because of his age.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But the LORD had told Ahijah, "Jeroboam's wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill, and you are to give her such and such an answer. When she arrives, she will pretend to be someone else."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door, he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I have been sent to you with bad news.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I raised you up from among the people and made you a leader over my people Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, but you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">You have done more evil than all who lived before you. You have made for yourself other gods, idols made of metal; you have provoked me to anger and thrust me behind your back.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"'Because of this, I am going to bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every last male in Israel-slave or free. I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns dung, until it is all gone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Dogs will eat those belonging to Jeroboam who die in the city, and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country. The LORD has spoken!'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"As for you, go back home. When you set foot in your city, the boy will die.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will be buried, because he is the only one in the house of Jeroboam in whom the LORD, the God of Israel, has found anything good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"The LORD will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will cut off the family of Jeroboam. This is the day! What? Yes, even now.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And the LORD will strike Israel, so that it will be like a reed swaying in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that he gave to their forefathers and scatter them beyond the River, because they provoked the LORD to anger by making Asherah poles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">And he will give Israel up because of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Jeroboam's wife got up and left and went to Tirzah. As soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, as the LORD had said through his servant the prophet Ahijah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The other events of Jeroboam's reign, his wars and how he ruled, are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">He reigned for twenty-two years and then rested with his fathers. And Nadab his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Rehoboam son of Solomon was king in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mother's name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Judah did evil in the eyes of the LORD. By the sins they committed they stirred up his jealous anger more than their fathers had done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">They also set up for themselves high places, sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land; the people engaged in all the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He carried off the treasures of the temple of the LORD and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including all the gold shields Solomon had made.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Whenever the king went to the LORD's temple, the guards bore the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">As for the other events of Rehoboam's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">And Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. His mother's name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite. And Abijah his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijah became king of Judah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother's name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He committed all the sins his father had done before him; his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his forefather had been.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Nevertheless, for David's sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up a son to succeed him and by making Jerusalem strong.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">For David had done what was right in the eyes of the LORD and had not failed to keep any of the LORD's commands all the days of his life-except in the case of Uriah the Hittite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout Abijah's lifetime.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">As for the other events of Abijah's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And Asa his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa became king of Judah,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="11">Asa did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as his father David had done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He expelled the male shrine prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He even deposed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother, because she had made a repulsive Asherah pole. Asa cut the pole down and burned it in the Kidron Valley.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Although he did not remove the high places, Asa's heart was fully committed to the LORD all his life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He brought into the temple of the LORD the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Asa then took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the LORD's temple and of his own palace. He entrusted it to his officials and sent them to Ben-Hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, the king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Let there be a treaty between me and you," he said, "as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you a gift of silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maacah and all Kinnereth in addition to Naphtali.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then King Asa issued an order to all Judah-no one was exempt-and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using there. With them King Asa built up Geba in Benjamin, and also Mizpah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">As for all the other events of Asa's reign, all his achievements, all he did and the cities he built, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? In his old age, however, his feet became diseased.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then Asa rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of his father David. And Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, walking in the ways of his father and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar plotted against him, and he struck him down at Gibbethon, a Philistine town, while Nadab and all Israel were besieging it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of Asa king of Judah and succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">As soon as he began to reign, he killed Jeroboam's whole family. He did not leave Jeroboam anyone that breathed, but destroyed them all, according to the word of the LORD given through his servant Ahijah the Shilonite-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">because of the sins Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit, and because he provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="32">There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"I lifted you up from the dust and made you leader of my people Israel, but you walked in the ways of Jeroboam and caused my people Israel to sin and to provoke me to anger by their sins.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So I am about to consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Dogs will eat those belonging to Baasha who die in the city, and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">As for the other events of Baasha's reign, what he did and his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah. And Elah his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Moreover, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani to Baasha and his house, because of all the evil he had done in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger by the things he did, and becoming like the house of Jeroboam-and also because he destroyed it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Zimri, one of his officials, who had command of half his chariots, plotted against him. Elah was in Tirzah at the time, getting drunk in the home of Arza, the man in charge of the palace at Tirzah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Zimri came in, struck him down and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah. Then he succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">As soon as he began to reign and was seated on the throne, he killed off Baasha's whole family. He did not spare a single male, whether relative or friend.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">So Zimri destroyed the whole family of Baasha, in accordance with the word of the LORD spoken against Baasha through the prophet Jehu-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed and had caused Israel to commit, so that they provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by their worthless idols.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">As for the other events of Elah's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned in Tirzah seven days. The army was encamped near Gibbethon, a Philistine town.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When the Israelites in the camp heard that Zimri had plotted against the king and murdered him, they proclaimed Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that very day there in the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Omri and all the Israelites with him withdrew from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the royal palace and set the palace on fire around him. So he died,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">because of the sins he had committed, doing evil in the eyes of the LORD and walking in the ways of Jeroboam and in the sin he had committed and had caused Israel to commit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">As for the other events of Zimri's reign, and the rebellion he carried out, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then the people of Israel were split into two factions; half supported Tibni son of Ginath for king, and the other half supported Omri.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But Omri's followers proved stronger than those of Tibni son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri became king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned twelve years, six of them in Tirzah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver and built a city on the hill, calling it Samaria, after Shemer, the name of the former owner of the hill.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">But Omri did evil in the eyes of the LORD and sinned more than all those before him.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="30">Ahab son of Omri did more evil in the eyes of the LORD than any of those before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">He not only considered it trivial to commit the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, but he also married Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and began to serve Baal and worship him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">He set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he built in Samaria.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Ahab also made an Asherah pole and did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than did all the kings of Israel before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">In Ahab's time, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundations at the cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, in accordance with the word of the LORD spoken by Joshua son of Nun.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Elijah the Tishbite, from Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, "As the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">You will drink from the brook, and I have ordered the ravens to feed you there."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So he did what the LORD had told him. He went to the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan, and stayed there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then the word of the LORD came to him:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Go at once to Zarephath of Sidon and stay there. I have commanded a widow in that place to supply you with food."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, "Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">As she was going to get it, he called, "And bring me, please, a piece of bread."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"As surely as the LORD your God lives," she replied, "I don't have any bread-only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it-and die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Elijah said to her, "Don't be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small cake of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the LORD gives rain on the land.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the LORD spoken by Elijah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">She said to Elijah, "What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Give me your son," Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then he cried out to the LORD, "O LORD my God, have you brought tragedy also upon this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried to the LORD, "O LORD my God, let this boy's life return to him!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The LORD heard Elijah's cry, and the boy's life returned to him, and he lived.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, "Look, your son is alive!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then the woman said to Elijah, "Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD from your mouth is the truth."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
<VERS vnumber="1">After a long time, in the third year, the word of the LORD came to Elijah: "Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the land."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of his palace. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">While Jezebel was killing off the LORD's prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and water.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Ahab had said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, "Is it really you, my lord Elijah?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Yes," he replied. "Go tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"What have I done wrong," asked Obadiah, "that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">I don't know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the LORD since my youth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred of the LORD's prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">And now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' He will kill me!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Elijah said, "As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When he saw Elijah, he said to him, "Is that you, you troubler of Israel?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"I have not made trouble for Israel," Elijah replied. "But you and your father's family have. You have abandoned the LORD's commands and have followed the Baals.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Elijah went before the people and said, "How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him." But the people said nothing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then Elijah said to them, "I am the only one of the LORD's prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Get two bulls for us. Let them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire-he is God." Then all the people said, "What you say is good."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. "O Baal, answer us!" they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">At noon Elijah began to taunt them. "Shout louder!" he said. "Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then Elijah said to all the people, "Come here to me." They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which was in ruins.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, "Your name shall be Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">With the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, "Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">"Do it again," he said, and they did it again. "Do it a third time," he ordered, and they did it the third time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: "O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, "The LORD -he is God! The LORD -he is God!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Then Elijah commanded them, "Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">And Elijah said to Ahab, "Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">"Go and look toward the sea," he told his servant. And he went up and looked. "There is nothing there," he said. Seven times Elijah said, "Go back."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">The seventh time the servant reported, "A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea." So Elijah said, "Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">The power of the LORD came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">while he himself went a day's journey into the desert. He came to a broom tree, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. "I have had enough, LORD," he said. "Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then he lay down under the tree and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, "Get up and eat."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He looked around, and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The angel of the LORD came back a second time and touched him and said, "Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">There he went into a cave and spent the night. And the word of the LORD came to him: "What are you doing here, Elijah?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The LORD said, "Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by." Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">After the earthquake came a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a voice said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The LORD said to him, "Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel-all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and all whose mouths have not kissed him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. "Let me kiss my father and mother good-by," he said, "and then I will come with you.Go back," Elijah replied. "What have I done to you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his attendant.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram mustered his entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots, he went up and besieged Samaria and attacked it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, saying, "This is what Ben-Hadad says:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">'Your silver and gold are mine, and the best of your wives and children are mine.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The king of Israel answered, "Just as you say, my lord the king. I and all I have are yours."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The messengers came again and said, "This is what Ben-Hadad says: 'I sent to demand your silver and gold, your wives and your children.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But about this time tomorrow I am going to send my officials to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will seize everything you value and carry it away.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said to them, "See how this man is looking for trouble! When he sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, I did not refuse him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The elders and the people all answered, "Don't listen to him or agree to his demands."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So he replied to Ben-Hadad's messengers, "Tell my lord the king, 'Your servant will do all you demanded the first time, but this demand I cannot meet.'" They left and took the answer back to Ben-Hadad.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab: "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if enough dust remains in Samaria to give each of my men a handful."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The king of Israel answered, "Tell him: 'One who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Ben-Hadad heard this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents, and he ordered his men: "Prepare to attack." So they prepared to attack the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Meanwhile a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and announced, "This is what the LORD says: 'Do you see this vast army? I will give it into your hand today, and then you will know that I am the LORD.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"But who will do this?" asked Ahab. The prophet replied, "This is what the LORD says: 'The young officers of the provincial commanders will do it.' And who will start the battle?" he asked. The prophet answered, "You will."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So Ahab summoned the young officers of the provincial commanders, 232 men. Then he assembled the rest of the Israelites, 7,000 in all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">They set out at noon while Ben-Hadad and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The young officers of the provincial commanders went out first. Now Ben-Hadad had dispatched scouts, who reported, "Men are advancing from Samaria."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He said, "If they have come out for peace, take them alive; if they have come out for war, take them alive."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The young officers of the provincial commanders marched out of the city with the army behind them</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">and each one struck down his opponent. At that, the Arameans fled, with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with some of his horsemen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The king of Israel advanced and overpowered the horses and chariots and inflicted heavy losses on the Arameans.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Afterward, the prophet came to the king of Israel and said, "Strengthen your position and see what must be done, because next spring the king of Aram will attack you again."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Meanwhile, the officials of the king of Aram advised him, "Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they were too strong for us. But if we fight them on the plains, surely we will be stronger than they.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Do this: Remove all the kings from their commands and replace them with other officers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">You must also raise an army like the one you lost-horse for horse and chariot for chariot-so we can fight Israel on the plains. Then surely we will be stronger than they." He agreed with them and acted accordingly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The next spring Ben-Hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">When the Israelites were also mustered and given provisions, they marched out to meet them. The Israelites camped opposite them like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans covered the countryside.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">The man of God came up and told the king of Israel, "This is what the LORD says: 'Because the Arameans think the LORD is a god of the hills and not a god of the valleys, I will deliver this vast army into your hands, and you will know that I am the LORD.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">For seven days they camped opposite each other, and on the seventh day the battle was joined. The Israelites inflicted a hundred thousand casualties on the Aramean foot soldiers in one day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">The rest of them escaped to the city of Aphek, where the wall collapsed on twenty-seven thousand of them. And Ben-Hadad fled to the city and hid in an inner room.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">His officials said to him, "Look, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful. Let us go to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads. Perhaps he will spare your life."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Wearing sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads, they went to the king of Israel and said, "Your servant Ben-Hadad says: 'Please let me live.'" The king answered, "Is he still alive? He is my brother."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">The men took this as a good sign and were quick to pick up his word. "Yes, your brother Ben-Hadad!" they said. "Go and get him," the king said. When Ben-Hadad came out, Ahab had him come up into his chariot.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">"I will return the cities my father took from your father," Ben-Hadad offered. "You may set up your own market areas in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria." Ahab said, "On the basis of a treaty I will set you free." So he made a treaty with him, and let him go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">By the word of the LORD one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion, "Strike me with your weapon," but the man refused.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">So the prophet said, "Because you have not obeyed the LORD, as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you." And after the man went away, a lion found him and killed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">The prophet found another man and said, "Strike me, please." So the man struck him and wounded him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Then the prophet went and stood by the road waiting for the king. He disguised himself with his headband down over his eyes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">As the king passed by, the prophet called out to him, "Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and someone came to me with a captive and said, 'Guard this man. If he is missing, it will be your life for his life, or you must pay a talent of silver.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">While your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared.That is your sentence," the king of Israel said. "You have pronounced it yourself."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Then the prophet quickly removed the headband from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">He said to the king, "This is what the LORD says: 'You have set free a man I had determined should die. Therefore it is your life for his life, your people for his people.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">Sullen and angry, the king of Israel went to his palace in Samaria.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
<VERS vnumber="1">Some time later there was an incident involving a vineyard belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite. The vineyard was in Jezreel, close to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Ahab said to Naboth, "Let me have your vineyard to use for a vegetable garden, since it is close to my palace. In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you whatever it is worth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But Naboth replied, "The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So Ahab went home, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said, "I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers." He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">His wife Jezebel came in and asked him, "Why are you so sullen? Why won't you eat?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He answered her, "Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite, 'Sell me your vineyard; or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.' But he said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Jezebel his wife said, "Is this how you act as king over Israel? Get up and eat! Cheer up. I'll get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, placed his seal on them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">In those letters she wrote: "Proclaim a day of fasting and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them testify that he has cursed both God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against Naboth before the people, saying, "Naboth has cursed both God and the king." So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then they sent word to Jezebel: "Naboth has been stoned and is dead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, "Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite that he refused to sell you. He is no longer alive, but dead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of Naboth's vineyard.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He is now in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?' Then say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: In the place where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, dogs will lick up your blood-yes, yours!'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Ahab said to Elijah, "So you have found me, my enemy!I have found you," he answered, "because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">'I am going to bring disaster on you. I will consume your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel-slave or free.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have provoked me to anger and have caused Israel to sin.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"And also concerning Jezebel the LORD says: 'Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city, and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">(There was never a man like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD, urged on by Jezebel his wife.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He behaved in the vilest manner by going after idols, like the Amorites the LORD drove out before Israel.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and fasted. He lay in sackcloth and went around meekly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">"Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself, I will not bring this disaster in his day, but I will bring it on his house in the days of his son."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
<VERS vnumber="1">For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">But in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see the king of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The king of Israel had said to his officials, "Don't you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So he asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "First seek the counsel of the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So the king of Israel brought together the prophets-about four hundred men-and asked them, "Shall I go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?Go," they answered, "for the Lord will give it into the king's hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD here whom we can inquire of?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.The king should not say that," Jehoshaphat replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared, "This is what the LORD says: 'With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. "Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious," they said, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, as one man the other prophets are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">But Micaiah said, "As surely as the LORD lives, I can tell him only what the LORD tells me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When he arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?Attack and be victorious," he answered, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Micaiah continued, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?'"One suggested this, and another that.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD and said, 'I will entice him.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"'By what means?' the LORD asked. "'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. "'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the LORD. 'Go and do it.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"So now the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The LORD has decreed disaster for you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. "Which way did the spirit from the LORD go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king's son</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">and say, 'This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Mark my words, all you people!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "Surely this is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried out,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">All day long the battle raged, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: "Every man to his town; everyone to his land!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed), and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of the LORD had declared.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">As for the other events of Ahab's reign, including all he did, the palace he built and inlaid with ivory, and the cities he fortified, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Ahab rested with his fathers. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">In everything he walked in the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD. The high places, however, were not removed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">As for the other events of Jehoshaphat's reign, the things he achieved and his military exploits, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">He rid the land of the rest of the male shrine prostitutes who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">There was then no king in Edom; a deputy ruled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">Now Jehoshaphat built a fleet of trading ships to go to Ophir for gold, but they never set sail-they were wrecked at Ezion Geber.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my men sail with your men," but Jehoshaphat refused.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">Then Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son succeeded him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="52">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, because he walked in the ways of his father and mother and in the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="53">He served and worshiped Baal and provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger, just as his father had done.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">After Ahab's death, Moab rebelled against Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, "Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Therefore this is what the LORD says: 'You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!'" So Elijah went.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, "Why have you come back?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"A man came to meet us," they replied. "And he said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, "This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!"'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The king asked them, "What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">They replied, "He was a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist." The king said, "That was Elijah the Tishbite."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, "Man of God, the king says, 'Come down!'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Elijah answered the captain, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. The captain said to him, "Man of God, this is what the king says, 'Come down at once!'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"If I am a man of God," Elijah replied, "may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. "Man of God," he begged, "please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">See, fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He told the king, "This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So he died, according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">As for all the other events of Ahaziah's reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here; the LORD has sent me to Bethel." But Elisha said, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?Yes, I know," Elisha replied, "but do not speak of it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here, Elisha; the LORD has sent me to Jericho." And he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went to Jericho.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?Yes, I know," he replied, "but do not speak of it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here; the LORD has sent me to the Jordan." And he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So the two of them walked on.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Fifty men of the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and struck the water with it. The water divided to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit," Elisha replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"You have asked a difficult thing," Elijah said, "yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours-otherwise not."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Elisha saw this and cried out, "My father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!" And Elisha saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them apart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then he took the cloak that had fallen from him and struck the water with it. "Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" he asked. When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The company of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, "The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha." And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Look," they said, "we your servants have fifty able men. Let them go and look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has picked him up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley.No," Elisha replied, "do not send them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But they persisted until he was too ashamed to refuse. So he said, "Send them." And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, "Didn't I tell you not to go?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The men of the city said to Elisha, "Look, our lord, this town is well situated, as you can see, but the water is bad and the land is unproductive."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"Bring me a new bowl," he said, "and put salt in it." So they brought it to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it, saying, "This is what the LORD says: 'I have healed this water. Never again will it cause death or make the land unproductive.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">And the water has remained wholesome to this day, according to the word Elisha had spoken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some youths came out of the town and jeered at him. "Go on up, you baldhead!" they said. "Go on up, you baldhead!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">And he went on to Mount Carmel and from there returned to Samaria.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">Joram son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned twelve years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, but not as his father and mother had done. He got rid of the sacred stone of Baal that his father had made.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Now Mesha king of Moab raised sheep, and he had to supply the king of Israel with a hundred thousand lambs and with the wool of a hundred thousand rams.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But after Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So at that time King Joram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?I will go with you," he replied. "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"By what route shall we attack?" he asked. "Through the Desert of Edom," he answered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So the king of Israel set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. After a roundabout march of seven days, the army had no more water for themselves or for the animals with them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"What!" exclaimed the king of Israel. "Has the LORD called us three kings together only to hand us over to Moab?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of the LORD through him?" An officer of the king of Israel answered, "Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah. "</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What do we have to do with each other? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother.No," the king of Israel answered, "because it was the LORD who called us three kings together to hand us over to Moab."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Elisha said, "As surely as the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, if I did not have respect for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you or even notice you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But now bring me a harpist." While the harpist was playing, the hand of the LORD came upon Elisha</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">and he said, "This is what the LORD says: Make this valley full of ditches.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">For this is what the LORD says: You will see neither wind nor rain, yet this valley will be filled with water, and you, your cattle and your other animals will drink.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">This is an easy thing in the eyes of the LORD; he will also hand Moab over to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town. You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs, and ruin every good field with stones."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The next morning, about the time for offering the sacrifice, there it was-water flowing from the direction of Edom! And the land was filled with water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come to fight against them; so every man, young and old, who could bear arms was called up and stationed on the border.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites across the way, the water looked red-like blood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"That's blood!" they said. "Those kings must have fought and slaughtered each other. Now to the plunder, Moab!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and fought them until they fled. And the Israelites invaded the land and slaughtered the Moabites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">They destroyed the towns, and each man threw a stone on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree. Only Kir Hareseth was left with its stones in place, but men armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">When the king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they failed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The fury against Israel was great; they withdrew and returned to their own land.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, "Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the LORD. But now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Elisha replied to her, "How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?Your servant has nothing there at all," she said, "except a little oil."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Elisha said, "Go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars. Don't ask for just a few.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">She left him and afterward shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When all the jars were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another one." But he replied, "There is not a jar left." Then the oil stopped flowing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">She went and told the man of God, and he said, "Go, sell the oil and pay your debts. You and your sons can live on what is left."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">One day Elisha went to Shunem. And a well-to-do woman was there, who urged him to stay for a meal. So whenever he came by, he stopped there to eat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">She said to her husband, "I know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Let's make a small room on the roof and put in it a bed and a table, a chair and a lamp for him. Then he can stay there whenever he comes to us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">One day when Elisha came, he went up to his room and lay down there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He said to his servant Gehazi, "Call the Shunammite." So he called her, and she stood before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Elisha said to him, "Tell her, 'You have gone to all this trouble for us. Now what can be done for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?'" She replied, "I have a home among my own people."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"What can be done for her?" Elisha asked. Gehazi said, "Well, she has no son and her husband is old."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Elisha said, "Call her." So he called her, and she stood in the doorway.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"About this time next year," Elisha said, "you will hold a son in your arms.No, my lord," she objected. "Don't mislead your servant, O man of God!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But the woman became pregnant, and the next year about that same time she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"My head! My head!" he said to his father. His father told a servant, "Carry him to his mother."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">After the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and went out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">She called her husband and said, "Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"Why go to him today?" he asked. "It's not the New Moon or the Sabbath.It's all right," she said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">She saddled the donkey and said to her servant, "Lead on; don't slow down for me unless I tell you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When he saw her in the distance, the man of God said to his servant Gehazi, "Look! There's the Shunammite!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Run to meet her and ask her, 'Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?' Everything is all right," she said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, "Leave her alone! She is in bitter distress, but the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me why."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">"Did I ask you for a son, my lord?" she said. "Didn't I tell you, 'Don't raise my hopes'?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Elisha said to Gehazi, "Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand and run. If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer. Lay my staff on the boy's face."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">But the child's mother said, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So he got up and followed her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy's face, but there was no sound or response. So Gehazi went back to meet Elisha and told him, "The boy has not awakened."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Then he got on the bed and lay upon the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out upon him, the boy's body grew warm.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out upon him once more. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, "Call the Shunammite." And he did. When she came, he said, "Take your son."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">She came in, fell at his feet and bowed to the ground. Then she took her son and went out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in that region. While the company of the prophets was meeting with him, he said to his servant, "Put on the large pot and cook some stew for these men."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">One of them went out into the fields to gather herbs and found a wild vine. He gathered some of its gourds and filled the fold of his cloak. When he returned, he cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">The stew was poured out for the men, but as they began to eat it, they cried out, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!" And they could not eat it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Elisha said, "Get some flour." He put it into the pot and said, "Serve it to the people to eat." And there was nothing harmful in the pot.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">A man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread baked from the first ripe grain, along with some heads of new grain. "Give it to the people to eat," Elisha said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">"How can I set this before a hundred men?" his servant asked. But Elisha answered, "Give it to the people to eat. For this is what the LORD says: 'They will eat and have some left over.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">Then he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man in the sight of his master and highly regarded, because through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. He was a valiant soldier, but he had leprosy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Now bands from Aram had gone out and had taken captive a young girl from Israel, and she served Naaman's wife.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">She said to her mistress, "If only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Naaman went to his master and told him what the girl from Israel had said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"By all means, go," the king of Aram replied. "I will send a letter to the king of Israel." So Naaman left, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold and ten sets of clothing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The letter that he took to the king of Israel read: "With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">As soon as the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his robes and said, "Am I God? Can I kill and bring back to life? Why does this fellow send someone to me to be cured of his leprosy? See how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes, he sent him this message: "Why have you torn your robes? Have the man come to me and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha's house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Elisha sent a messenger to say to him, "Go, wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored and you will be cleansed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But Naaman went away angry and said, "I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, wave his hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than any of the waters of Israel? Couldn't I wash in them and be cleansed?" So he turned and went off in a rage.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Naaman's servants went to him and said, "My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, 'Wash and be cleansed'!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, as the man of God had told him, and his flesh was restored and became clean like that of a young boy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. He stood before him and said, "Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. Please accept now a gift from your servant."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The prophet answered, "As surely as the LORD lives, whom I serve, I will not accept a thing." And even though Naaman urged him, he refused.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"If you will not," said Naaman, "please let me, your servant, be given as much earth as a pair of mules can carry, for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god but the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But may the LORD forgive your servant for this one thing: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to bow down and he is leaning on my arm and I bow there also-when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant for this."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Go in peace," Elisha said. After Naaman had traveled some distance,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, "My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him. "Is everything all right?" he asked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"Everything is all right," Gehazi answered. "My master sent me to say, 'Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"By all means, take two talents," said Naaman. He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house. He sent the men away and they left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then he went in and stood before his master Elisha. "Where have you been, Gehazi?" Elisha asked. "Your servant didn't go anywhere," Gehazi answered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">But Elisha said to him, "Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money, or to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, flocks, herds, or menservants and maidservants?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Naaman's leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever." Then Gehazi went from Elisha's presence and he was leprous, as white as snow.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">The company of the prophets said to Elisha, "Look, the place where we meet with you is too small for us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a pole; and let us build a place there for us to live." And he said, "Go."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then one of them said, "Won't you please come with your servants?I will," Elisha replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And he went with them. They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axhead fell into the water. "Oh, my lord," he cried out, "it was borrowed!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The man of God asked, "Where did it fall?" When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and made the iron float.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Lift it out," he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel. After conferring with his officers, he said, "I will set up my camp in such and such a place."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The man of God sent word to the king of Israel: "Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">This enraged the king of Aram. He summoned his officers and demanded of them, "Will you not tell me which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"None of us, my lord the king," said one of his officers, "but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"Go, find out where he is," the king ordered, "so I can send men and capture him." The report came back: "He is in Dothan."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there. They went by night and surrounded the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. "Oh, my lord, what shall we do?" the servant asked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Don't be afraid," the prophet answered. "Those who are with us are more than those who are with them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">And Elisha prayed, "O LORD, open his eyes so he may see." Then the LORD opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">As the enemy came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, "Strike these people with blindness." So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Elisha told them, "This is not the road and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are looking for." And he led them to Samaria.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">After they entered the city, Elisha said, "LORD, open the eyes of these men so they can see." Then the LORD opened their eyes and they looked, and there they were, inside Samaria.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, "Shall I kill them, my father? Shall I kill them?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"Do not kill them," he answered. "Would you kill men you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So he prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. So the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel's territory.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Some time later, Ben-Hadad king of Aram mobilized his entire army and marched up and laid siege to Samaria.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">There was a great famine in the city; the siege lasted so long that a donkey's head sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a quarter of a cab of seed pods for five shekels.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, "Help me, my lord the king!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The king replied, "If the LORD does not help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor? From the winepress?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then he asked her, "What's the matter?" She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat my son.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, 'Give up your son so we may eat him,' but she had hidden him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">When the king heard the woman's words, he tore his robes. As he went along the wall, the people looked, and there, underneath, he had sackcloth on his body.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">He said, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, "Don't you see how this murderer is sending someone to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it shut against him. Is not the sound of his master's footsteps behind him?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">While he was still talking to them, the messenger came down to him. And the king said, "This disaster is from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">Elisha said, "Hear the word of the LORD. This is what the LORD says: About this time tomorrow, a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The officer on whose arm the king was leaning said to the man of God, "Look, even if the LORD should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?You will see it with your own eyes," answered Elisha, "but you will not eat any of it!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now there were four men with leprosy at the entrance of the city gate. They said to each other, "Why stay here until we die?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">If we say, 'We'll go into the city'-the famine is there, and we will die. And if we stay here, we will die. So let's go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender. If they spare us, we live; if they kill us, then we die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">At dusk they got up and went to the camp of the Arameans. When they reached the edge of the camp, not a man was there,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">for the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a great army, so that they said to one another, "Look, the king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So they got up and fled in the dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The men who had leprosy reached the edge of the camp and entered one of the tents. They ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold and clothes, and went off and hid them. They returned and entered another tent and took some things from it and hid them also.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then they said to each other, "We're not doing right. This is a day of good news and we are keeping it to ourselves. If we wait until daylight, punishment will overtake us. Let's go at once and report this to the royal palace."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them, "We went into the Aramean camp and not a man was there-not a sound of anyone-only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents left just as they were."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported within the palace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The king got up in the night and said to his officers, "I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving; so they have left the camp to hide in the countryside, thinking, 'They will surely come out, and then we will take them alive and get into the city.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">One of his officers answered, "Have some men take five of the horses that are left in the city. Their plight will be like that of all the Israelites left here-yes, they will only be like all these Israelites who are doomed. So let us send them to find out what happened."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So they selected two chariots with their horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army. He commanded the drivers, "Go and find out what has happened."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">They followed them as far as the Jordan, and they found the whole road strewn with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown away in their headlong flight. So the messengers returned and reported to the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, as the LORD had said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Now the king had put the officer on whose arm he leaned in charge of the gate, and the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to his house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">It happened as the man of God had said to the king: "About this time tomorrow, a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The officer had said to the man of God, "Look, even if the LORD should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?" The man of God had replied, "You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And that is exactly what happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, "Go away with your family and stay for a while wherever you can, because the LORD has decreed a famine in the land that will last seven years."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The woman proceeded to do as the man of God said. She and her family went away and stayed in the land of the Philistines seven years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">At the end of the seven years she came back from the land of the Philistines and went to the king to beg for her house and land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The king was talking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, and had said, "Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Just as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came to beg the king for her house and land. Gehazi said, "This is the woman, my lord the king, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The king asked the woman about it, and she told him. Then he assigned an official to her case and said to him, "Give back everything that belonged to her, including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill. When the king was told, "The man of God has come all the way up here,"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">he said to Hazael, "Take a gift with you and go to meet the man of God. Consult the LORD through him; ask him, 'Will I recover from this illness?'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him as a gift forty camel-loads of all the finest wares of Damascus. He went in and stood before him, and said, "Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask, 'Will I recover from this illness?'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Elisha answered, "Go and say to him, 'You will certainly recover'; but the LORD has revealed to me that he will in fact die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He stared at him with a fixed gaze until Hazael felt ashamed. Then the man of God began to weep.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"Why is my lord weeping?" asked Hazael. "Because I know the harm you will do to the Israelites," he answered. "You will set fire to their fortified places, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground, and rip open their pregnant women."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Hazael said, "How could your servant, a mere dog, accomplish such a feat?The LORD has shown me that you will become king of Aram," answered Elisha.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master. When Ben-Hadad asked, "What did Elisha say to you?" Hazael replied, "He told me that you would certainly recover."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But the next day he took a thick cloth, soaked it in water and spread it over the king's face, so that he died. Then Hazael succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat began his reign as king of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Nevertheless, for the sake of his servant David, the LORD was not willing to destroy Judah. He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So Jehoram went to Zair with all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night; his army, however, fled back home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">As for the other events of Jehoram's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Jehoram rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">He walked in the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was related by marriage to Ahab's family.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">so King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramoth in his battle with Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab, because he had been wounded.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">The prophet Elisha summoned a man from the company of the prophets and said to him, "Tuck your cloak into your belt, take this flask of oil with you and go to Ramoth Gilead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">When you get there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go to him, get him away from his companions and take him into an inner room.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then take the flask and pour the oil on his head and declare, 'This is what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.' Then open the door and run; don't delay!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When he arrived, he found the army officers sitting together. "I have a message for you, commander," he said. "For which of us?" asked Jehu. "For you, commander," he replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu's head and declared, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I anoint you king over the LORD's people Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master, and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the LORD's servants shed by Jezebel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel-slave or free.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her on the plot of ground at Jezreel, and no one will bury her.'" Then he opened the door and ran.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When Jehu went out to his fellow officers, one of them asked him, "Is everything all right? Why did this madman come to you?You know the man and the sort of things he says," Jehu replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"That's not true!" they said. "Tell us." Jehu said, "Here is what he told me: 'This is what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">They hurried and took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps. Then they blew the trumpet and shouted, "Jehu is king!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against Hazael king of Aram,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle with Hazael king of Aram.) Jehu said, "If this is the way you feel, don't let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel, because Joram was resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu's troops approaching, he called out, "I see some troops coming.Get a horseman," Joram ordered. "Send him to meet them and ask, 'Do you come in peace?'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, "This is what the king says: 'Do you come in peace?' What do you have to do with peace?" Jehu replied. "Fall in behind me." The lookout reported, "The messenger has reached them, but he isn't coming back."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">So the king sent out a second horseman. When he came to them he said, "This is what the king says: 'Do you come in peace?'" Jehu replied, "What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The lookout reported, "He has reached them, but he isn't coming back either. The driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi-he drives like a madman."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"Hitch up my chariot," Joram ordered. And when it was hitched up, Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">When Joram saw Jehu he asked, "Have you come in peace, Jehu?How can there be peace," Jehu replied, "as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Joram turned about and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, "Treachery, Ahaziah!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Jehu said to Bidkar, his chariot officer, "Pick him up and throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Ahab his father when the LORD made this prophecy about him:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">'Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, declares the LORD, and I will surely make you pay for it on this plot of ground, declares the LORD.' Now then, pick him up and throw him on that plot, in accordance with the word of the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">When Ahaziah king of Judah saw what had happened, he fled up the road to Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him, shouting, "Kill him too!" They wounded him in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam, but he escaped to Megiddo and died there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his fathers in his tomb in the City of David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">(In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king of Judah.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then Jehu went to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about it, she painted her eyes, arranged her hair and looked out of a window.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">As Jehu entered the gate, she asked, "Have you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">He looked up at the window and called out, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked down at him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">"Throw her down!" Jehu said. So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered the wall and the horses as they trampled her underfoot.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Jehu went in and ate and drank. "Take care of that cursed woman," he said, "and bury her, for she was a king's daughter."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing except her skull, her feet and her hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">They went back and told Jehu, who said, "This is the word of the LORD that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs will devour Jezebel's flesh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Jezebel's body will be like refuse on the ground in the plot at Jezreel, so that no one will be able to say, 'This is Jezebel.'"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now there were in Samaria seventy sons of the house of Ahab. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria: to the officials of Jezreel, to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab's children. He said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"As soon as this letter reaches you, since your master's sons are with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weapons,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">choose the best and most worthy of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne. Then fight for your master's house."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But they were terrified and said, "If two kings could not resist him, how can we?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So the palace administrator, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu: "We are your servants and we will do anything you say. We will not appoint anyone as king; you do whatever you think best."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying, "If you are on my side and will obey me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow." Now the royal princes, seventy of them, were with the leading men of the city, who were rearing them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When the letter arrived, these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, "They have brought the heads of the princes." Then Jehu ordered, "Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The next morning Jehu went out. He stood before all the people and said, "You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Know then, that not a word the LORD has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail. The LORD has done what he promised through his servant Elijah."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his chief men, his close friends and his priests, leaving him no survivor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Jehu then set out and went toward Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, "Who are you?" They said, "We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"Take them alive!" he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Eked-forty-two men. He left no survivor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">After he left there, he came upon Jehonadab son of Recab, who was on his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, "Are you in accord with me, as I am with you?I am," Jehonadab answered. "If so," said Jehu, "give me your hand." So he did, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Jehu said, "Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD." Then he had him ride along in his chariot.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all who were left there of Ahab's family; he destroyed them, according to the word of the LORD spoken to Elijah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Now summon all the prophets of Baal, all his ministers and all his priests. See that no one is missing, because I am going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come will no longer live." But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the ministers of Baal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Jehu said, "Call an assembly in honor of Baal." So they proclaimed it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then he sent word throughout Israel, and all the ministers of Baal came; not one stayed away. They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from one end to the other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, "Bring robes for all the ministers of Baal." So he brought out robes for them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Recab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the ministers of Baal, "Look around and see that no servants of the LORD are here with you-only ministers of Baal."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning: "If one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, it will be your life for his life."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and officers: "Go in and kill them; let no one escape." So they cut them down with the sword. The guards and officers threw the bodies out and then entered the inner shrine of the temple of Baal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">They brought the sacred stone out of the temple of Baal and burned it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">They demolished the sacred stone of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal, and people have used it for a latrine to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">However, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit-the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">The LORD said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in accomplishing what is right in my eyes and have done to the house of Ahab all I had in mind to do, your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Yet Jehu was not careful to keep the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">In those days the LORD began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael overpowered the Israelites throughout their territory</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">east of the Jordan in all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben and Manasseh), from Aroer by the Arnon Gorge through Gilead to Bashan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">As for the other events of Jehu's reign, all he did, and all his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Jehu rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram and sister of Ahaziah, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes, who were about to be murdered. She put him and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah; so he was not killed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He remained hidden with his nurse at the temple of the LORD for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">In the seventh year Jehoiada sent for the commanders of units of a hundred, the Carites and the guards and had them brought to him at the temple of the LORD. He made a covenant with them and put them under oath at the temple of the LORD. Then he showed them the king's son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He commanded them, saying, "This is what you are to do: You who are in the three companies that are going on duty on the Sabbath-a third of you guarding the royal palace,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">a third at the Sur Gate, and a third at the gate behind the guard, who take turns guarding the temple-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">and you who are in the other two companies that normally go off Sabbath duty are all to guard the temple for the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Station yourselves around the king, each man with his weapon in his hand. Anyone who approaches your ranks must be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The commanders of units of a hundred did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men-those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty-and came to Jehoiada the priest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then he gave the commanders the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The guards, each with his weapon in his hand, stationed themselves around the king-near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Jehoiada brought out the king's son and put the crown on him; he presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him, and the people clapped their hands and shouted, "Long live the king!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">When Athaliah heard the noise made by the guards and the people, she went to the people at the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">She looked and there was the king, standing by the pillar, as the custom was. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her robes and called out, "Treason! Treason!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops: "Bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her." For the priest had said, "She must not be put to death in the temple of the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So they seized her as she reached the place where the horses enter the palace grounds, and there she was put to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Jehoiada then made a covenant between the LORD and the king and people that they would be the LORD's people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols to pieces and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars. Then Jehoiada the priest posted guards at the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, the guards and all the people of the land, and together they brought the king down from the temple of the LORD and went into the palace, entering by way of the gate of the guards. The king then took his place on the royal throne,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">and all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quiet, because Athaliah had been slain with the sword at the palace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Joash was seven years old when he began to reign.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the seventh year of Jehu, Joash became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother's name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the years Jehoiada the priest instructed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Joash said to the priests, "Collect all the money that is brought as sacred offerings to the temple of the LORD -the money collected in the census, the money received from personal vows and the money brought voluntarily to the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Let every priest receive the money from one of the treasurers, and let it be used to repair whatever damage is found in the temple."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But by the twenty-third year of King Joash the priests still had not repaired the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Therefore King Joash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and asked them, "Why aren't you repairing the damage done to the temple? Take no more money from your treasurers, but hand it over for repairing the temple."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The priests agreed that they would not collect any more money from the people and that they would not repair the temple themselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid. He placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one enters the temple of the LORD. The priests who guarded the entrance put into the chest all the money that was brought to the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the royal secretary and the high priest came, counted the money that had been brought into the temple of the LORD and put it into bags.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When the amount had been determined, they gave the money to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. With it they paid those who worked on the temple of the LORD -the carpenters and builders,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">the masons and stonecutters. They purchased timber and dressed stone for the repair of the temple of the LORD, and met all the other expenses of restoring the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The money brought into the temple was not spent for making silver basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, trumpets or any other articles of gold or silver for the temple of the LORD;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">it was paid to the workmen, who used it to repair the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">They did not require an accounting from those to whom they gave the money to pay the workers, because they acted with complete honesty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The money from the guilt offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the temple of the LORD; it belonged to the priests.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">About this time Hazael king of Aram went up and attacked Gath and captured it. Then he turned to attack Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But Joash king of Judah took all the sacred objects dedicated by his fathers-Jehoshaphat, Jehoram and Ahaziah, the kings of Judah-and the gifts he himself had dedicated and all the gold found in the treasuries of the temple of the LORD and of the royal palace, and he sent them to Hazael king of Aram, who then withdrew from Jerusalem.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">In the twenty-third year of Joash son of Ahaziah king of Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD by following the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit, and he did not turn away from them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So the LORD's anger burned against Israel, and for a long time he kept them under the power of Hazael king of Aram and Ben-Hadad his son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then Jehoahaz sought the LORD's favor, and the LORD listened to him, for he saw how severely the king of Aram was oppressing Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The LORD provided a deliverer for Israel, and they escaped from the power of Aram. So the Israelites lived in their own homes as they had before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit; they continued in them. Also, the Asherah pole remained standing in Samaria.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Nothing had been left of the army of Jehoahaz except fifty horsemen, ten chariots and ten thousand foot soldiers, for the king of Aram had destroyed the rest and made them like the dust at threshing time.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned nine years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, but not like the kings of Israel who preceded him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up to attack Hoshea, who had been Shalmaneser's vassal and had paid him tribute.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was a traitor, for he had sent envoys to So king of Egypt, and he no longer paid tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore Shalmaneser seized him and put him in prison.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The king of Assyria invaded the entire land, marched against Samaria and laid siege to it for three years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">All this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of Egypt from under the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They worshiped other gods</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">and followed the practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before them, as well as the practices that the kings of Israel had introduced.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The Israelites secretly did things against the LORD their God that were not right. From watchtower to fortified city they built themselves high places in all their towns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">At every high place they burned incense, as the nations whom the LORD had driven out before them had done. They did wicked things that provoked the LORD to anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They worshiped idols, though the LORD had said, "You shall not do this."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The LORD warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers: "Turn from your evil ways. Observe my commands and decrees, in accordance with the entire Law that I commanded your fathers to obey and that I delivered to you through my servants the prophets."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">But they would not listen and were as stiff-necked as their fathers, who did not trust in the LORD their God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">They rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their fathers and the warnings he had given them. They followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless. They imitated the nations around them although the LORD had ordered them, "Do not do as they do," and they did the things the LORD had forbidden them to do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">They forsook all the commands of the LORD their God and made for themselves two idols cast in the shape of calves, and an Asherah pole. They bowed down to all the starry hosts, and they worshiped Baal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire. They practiced divination and sorcery and sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">So the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them from his presence. Only the tribe of Judah was left,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">and even Judah did not keep the commands of the LORD their God. They followed the practices Israel had introduced.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Therefore the LORD rejected all the people of Israel; he afflicted them and gave them into the hands of plunderers, until he thrust them from his presence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When he tore Israel away from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king. Jeroboam enticed Israel away from following the LORD and caused them to commit a great sin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The Israelites persisted in all the sins of Jeroboam and did not turn away from them</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">until the LORD removed them from his presence, as he had warned through all his servants the prophets. So the people of Israel were taken from their homeland into exile in Assyria, and they are still there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites. They took over Samaria and lived in its towns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">When they first lived there, they did not worship the LORD; so he sent lions among them and they killed some of the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">It was reported to the king of Assyria: "The people you deported and resettled in the towns of Samaria do not know what the god of that country requires. He has sent lions among them, which are killing them off, because the people do not know what he requires."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then the king of Assyria gave this order: "Have one of the priests you took captive from Samaria go back to live there and teach the people what the god of the land requires."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria came to live in Bethel and taught them how to worship the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Nevertheless, each national group made its own gods in the several towns where they settled, and set them up in the shrines the people of Samaria had made at the high places.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">The men from Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the men from Cuthah made Nergal, and the men from Hamath made Ashima;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire as sacrifices to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">They worshiped the LORD, but they also appointed all sorts of their own people to officiate for them as priests in the shrines at the high places.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">They worshiped the LORD, but they also served their own gods in accordance with the customs of the nations from which they had been brought.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">To this day they persist in their former practices. They neither worship the LORD nor adhere to the decrees and ordinances, the laws and commands that the LORD gave the descendants of Jacob, whom he named Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">When the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites, he commanded them: "Do not worship any other gods or bow down to them, serve them or sacrifice to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">But the LORD, who brought you up out of Egypt with mighty power and outstretched arm, is the one you must worship. To him you shall bow down and to him offer sacrifices.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">You must always be careful to keep the decrees and ordinances, the laws and commands he wrote for you. Do not worship other gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Do not forget the covenant I have made with you, and do not worship other gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">Rather, worship the LORD your God; it is he who will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">They would not listen, however, but persisted in their former practices.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Even while these people were worshiping the LORD, they were serving their idols. To this day their children and grandchildren continue to do as their fathers did.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother's name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father David had done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He removed the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. (It was called Nehushtan. )</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Hezekiah trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before him or after him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He held fast to the LORD and did not cease to follow him; he kept the commands the LORD had given Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And the LORD was with him; he was successful in whatever he undertook. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">From watchtower to fortified city, he defeated the Philistines, as far as Gaza and its territory.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">In King Hezekiah's fourth year, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched against Samaria and laid siege to it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">At the end of three years the Assyrians took it. So Samaria was captured in Hezekiah's sixth year, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The king of Assyria deported Israel to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in towns of the Medes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">This happened because they had not obeyed the LORD their God, but had violated his covenant-all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded. They neither listened to the commands nor carried them out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So Hezekiah king of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish: "I have done wrong. Withdraw from me, and I will pay whatever you demand of me." The king of Assyria exacted from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the temple of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">At this time Hezekiah king of Judah stripped off the gold with which he had covered the doors and doorposts of the temple of the LORD, and gave it to the king of Assyria.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The king of Assyria sent his supreme commander, his chief officer and his field commander with a large army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They came up to Jerusalem and stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">They called for the king; and Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The field commander said to them, "Tell Hezekiah: "'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">You say you have strategy and military strength-but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Look now, you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces a man's hand and wounds him if he leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">And if you say to me, "We are depending on the LORD our God"-isn't he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem"?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"'Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses-if you can put riders on them!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">How can you repulse one officer of the least of my master's officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this place without word from the LORD? The LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">But the commander replied, "Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the men sitting on the wall-who, like you, will have to eat their own filth and drink their own urine?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew: "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you from my hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, 'The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">"Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">until I come and take you to a land like your own, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey. Choose life and not death! "Do not listen to Hezekiah, for he is misleading you when he says, 'The LORD will deliver us.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, "Do not answer him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
<VERS vnumber="1">When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">They told him, "This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">It may be that the LORD your God will hear all the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the LORD your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When King Hezekiah's officials came to Isaiah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, 'This is what the LORD says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard-those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Listen! I am going to put such a spirit in him that when he hears a certain report, he will return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the Cushite king of Egypt, was marching out to fight against him. So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, 'Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver them: the gods of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivvah?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD: "O LORD, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Give ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; listen to the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"It is true, O LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste these nations and their lands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by men's hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Now, O LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone, O LORD, are God."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="4">Before Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the LORD came to him:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people, 'This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will heal you. On the third day from now you will go up to the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">I will add fifteen years to your life. And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then Isaiah said, "Prepare a poultice of figs." They did so and applied it to the boil, and he recovered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, "What will be the sign that the LORD will heal me and that I will go up to the temple of the LORD on the third day from now?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Isaiah answered, "This is the LORD's sign to you that the LORD will do what he has promised: Shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or shall it go back ten steps?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"It is a simple matter for the shadow to go forward ten steps," said Hezekiah. "Rather, have it go back ten steps."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then the prophet Isaiah called upon the LORD, and the LORD made the shadow go back the ten steps it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift, because he had heard of Hezekiah's illness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Hezekiah received the messengers and showed them all that was in his storehouses-the silver, the gold, the spices and the fine oil-his armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, "What did those men say, and where did they come from?From a distant land," Hezekiah replied. "They came from Babylon."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The prophet asked, "What did they see in your palace?They saw everything in my palace," Hezekiah said. "There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your fathers have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood, that will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"The word of the LORD you have spoken is good," Hezekiah replied. For he thought, "Will there not be peace and security in my lifetime?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">As for the other events of Hezekiah's reign, all his achievements and how he made the pool and the tunnel by which he brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Hezekiah rested with his fathers. And Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
<VERS vnumber="1">Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. His mother's name was Hephzibah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, following the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he also erected altars to Baal and made an Asherah pole, as Ahab king of Israel had done. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He built altars in the temple of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, "In Jerusalem I will put my Name."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">In both courts of the temple of the LORD, he built altars to all the starry hosts.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He sacrificed his own son in the fire, practiced sorcery and divination, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He took the carved Asherah pole he had made and put it in the temple, of which the LORD had said to David and to his son Solomon, "In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">I will not again make the feet of the Israelites wander from the land I gave their forefathers, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them and will keep the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But the people did not listen. Manasseh led them astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The LORD said through his servants the prophets:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Manasseh king of Judah has committed these detestable sins. He has done more evil than the Amorites who preceded him and has led Judah into sin with his idols.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Therefore this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I am going to bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab. I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and hand them over to their enemies. They will be looted and plundered by all their foes,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">because they have done evil in my eyes and have provoked me to anger from the day their forefathers came out of Egypt until this day."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Moreover, Manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end-besides the sin that he had caused Judah to commit, so that they did evil in the eyes of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">As for the other events of Manasseh's reign, and all he did, including the sin he committed, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzza. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. His mother's name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz; she was from Jotbah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He walked in all the ways of his father; he worshiped the idols his father had worshiped, and bowed down to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">He forsook the LORD, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Amon's officials conspired against him and assassinated the king in his palace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">As for the other events of Amon's reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He was buried in his grave in the garden of Uzza. And Josiah his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
<VERS vnumber="1">Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. His mother's name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah; she was from Bozkath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in all the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">In the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent the secretary, Shaphan son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the temple of the LORD. He said:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him get ready the money that has been brought into the temple of the LORD, which the doorkeepers have collected from the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Have them entrust it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. And have these men pay the workers who repair the temple of the LORD -</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">the carpenters, the builders and the masons. Also have them purchase timber and dressed stone to repair the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But they need not account for the money entrusted to them, because they are acting faithfully."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the LORD." He gave it to Shaphan, who read it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him: "Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the LORD and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his robes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king's attendant:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"Go and inquire of the LORD for me and for the people and for all Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the LORD's anger that burns against us because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written there concerning us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Acbor, Shaphan and Asaiah went to speak to the prophetess Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">She said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">'This is what the LORD says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people, according to everything written in the book the king of Judah has read.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and provoked me to anger by all the idols their hands have made, my anger will burn against this place and will not be quenched.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I have spoken against this place and its people, that they would become accursed and laid waste, and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Therefore I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place.'" So they took her answer back to the king.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He went up to the temple of the LORD with the men of Judah, the people of Jerusalem, the priests and the prophets-all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the LORD -to follow the LORD and keep his commands, regulations and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, thus confirming the words of the covenant written in this book. Then all the people pledged themselves to the covenant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the priests next in rank and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the LORD all the articles made for Baal and Asherah and all the starry hosts. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron Valley and took the ashes to Bethel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He did away with the pagan priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and on those around Jerusalem-those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations and to all the starry hosts.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He took the Asherah pole from the temple of the LORD to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem and burned it there. He ground it to powder and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes, which were in the temple of the LORD and where women did weaving for Asherah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Josiah brought all the priests from the towns of Judah and desecrated the high places, from Geba to Beersheba, where the priests had burned incense. He broke down the shrines at the gates-at the entrance to the Gate of Joshua, the city governor, which is on the left of the city gate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Although the priests of the high places did not serve at the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He desecrated Topheth, which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so no one could use it to sacrifice his son or daughter in the fire to Molech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He removed from the entrance to the temple of the LORD the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. They were in the court near the room of an official named Nathan-Melech. Josiah then burned the chariots dedicated to the sun.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the roof near the upper room of Ahaz, and the altars Manasseh had built in the two courts of the temple of the LORD. He removed them from there, smashed them to pieces and threw the rubble into the Kidron Valley.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The king also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem on the south of the Hill of Corruption-the ones Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the vile god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the people of Ammon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Josiah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles and covered the sites with human bones.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Even the altar at Bethel, the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin-even that altar and high place he demolished. He burned the high place and ground it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole also.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then Josiah looked around, and when he saw the tombs that were there on the hillside, he had the bones removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it, in accordance with the word of the LORD proclaimed by the man of God who foretold these things.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The king asked, "What is that tombstone I see?" The men of the city said, "It marks the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced against the altar of Bethel the very things you have done to it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"Leave it alone," he said. "Don't let anyone disturb his bones." So they spared his bones and those of the prophet who had come from Samaria.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Just as he had done at Bethel, Josiah removed and defiled all the shrines at the high places that the kings of Israel had built in the towns of Samaria that had provoked the LORD to anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Josiah slaughtered all the priests of those high places on the altars and burned human bones on them. Then he went back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The king gave this order to all the people: "Celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Not since the days of the judges who led Israel, nor throughout the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah, had any such Passover been observed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was celebrated to the LORD in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Furthermore, Josiah got rid of the mediums and spiritists, the household gods, the idols and all the other detestable things seen in Judah and Jerusalem. This he did to fulfill the requirements of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the LORD as he did-with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, in accordance with all the Law of Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Nevertheless, the LORD did not turn away from the heat of his fierce anger, which burned against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to provoke him to anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">So the LORD said, "I will remove Judah also from my presence as I removed Israel, and I will reject Jerusalem, the city I chose, and this temple, about which I said, 'There shall my Name be.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">As for the other events of Josiah's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah marched out to meet him in battle, but Neco faced him and killed him at Megiddo.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Josiah's servants brought his body in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as his fathers had done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Pharaoh Neco put him in chains at Riblah in the land of Hamath so that he might not reign in Jerusalem, and he imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah and changed Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt, and there he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh Neco the silver and gold he demanded. In order to do so, he taxed the land and exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land according to their assessments.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother's name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah; she was from Rumah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">And he did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as his fathers had done.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
<VERS vnumber="1">During Jehoiakim's reign, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded the land, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years. But then he changed his mind and rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The LORD sent Babylonian, Aramean, Moabite and Ammonite raiders against him. He sent them to destroy Judah, in accordance with the word of the LORD proclaimed by his servants the prophets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Surely these things happened to Judah according to the LORD's command, in order to remove them from his presence because of the sins of Manasseh and all he had done,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">including the shedding of innocent blood. For he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the LORD was not willing to forgive.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">As for the other events of Jehoiakim's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Jehoiakim rested with his fathers. And Jehoiachin his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The king of Egypt did not march out from his own country again, because the king of Babylon had taken all his territory, from the Wadi of Egypt to the Euphrates River.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother's name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan; she was from Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father had done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">At that time the officers of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced on Jerusalem and laid siege to it,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">and Nebuchadnezzar himself came up to the city while his officers were besieging it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his attendants, his nobles and his officials all surrendered to him. In the eighth year of the reign of the king of Babylon, he took Jehoiachin prisoner.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">As the LORD had declared, Nebuchadnezzar removed all the treasures from the temple of the LORD and from the royal palace, and took away all the gold articles that Solomon king of Israel had made for the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He carried into exile all Jerusalem: all the officers and fighting men, and all the craftsmen and artisans-a total of ten thousand. Only the poorest people of the land were left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin captive to Babylon. He also took from Jerusalem to Babylon the king's mother, his wives, his officials and the leading men of the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The king of Babylon also deported to Babylon the entire force of seven thousand fighting men, strong and fit for war, and a thousand craftsmen and artisans.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">It was because of the LORD's anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence. Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
<VERS vnumber="1">So in the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. He encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled at night through the gate between the two walls near the king's garden, though the Babylonians were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">but the Babylonian army pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">and he was captured. He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where sentence was pronounced on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. Then they put out his eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, an official of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He set fire to the temple of the LORD, the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The whole Babylonian army, under the commander of the imperial guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile the people who remained in the city, along with the rest of the populace and those who had gone over to the king of Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But the commander left behind some of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the LORD and they carried the bronze to Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The commander of the imperial guard took away the censers and sprinkling bowls-all that were made of pure gold or silver.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the movable stands, which Solomon had made for the temple of the LORD, was more than could be weighed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Each pillar was twenty-seven feet high. The bronze capital on top of one pillar was four and a half feet high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its network, was similar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Of those still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men and five royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land and sixty of his men who were found in the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed. So Judah went into captivity, away from her land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to be over the people he had left behind in Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">When all the army officers and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah-Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, and their men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Gedaliah took an oath to reassure them and their men. "Do not be afraid of the Babylonian officials," he said. "Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">In the seventh month, however, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood, came with ten men and assassinated Gedaliah and also the men of Judah and the Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">At this, all the people from the least to the greatest, together with the army officers, fled to Egypt for fear of the Babylonians.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year Evil-Merodach became king of Babylon, he released Jehoiachin from prison on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king's table.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Day by day the king gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
<VERS vnumber="1">These were the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he was banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish (they were among the warriors who helped him in battle;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">they were armed with bows and were able to shoot arrows or to sling stones right-handed or left-handed; they were kinsmen of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin):</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Ahiezer their chief and Joash the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, Jehu the Anathothite,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the Thirty, who was a leader of the Thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah and Shephatiah the Haruphite;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer and Jashobeam the Korahites;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were brave warriors, ready for battle and able to handle the shield and spear. Their faces were the faces of lions, and they were as swift as gazelles in the mountains.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Ezer was the chief, Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Jeremiah the tenth and Macbannai the eleventh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">These Gadites were army commanders; the least was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">It was they who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight everyone living in the valleys, to the east and to the west.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">David went out to meet them and said to them, "If you have come to me in peace, to help me, I am ready to have you unite with me. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free from violence, may the God of our fathers see it and judge you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the Thirty, and he said: "We are yours, O David! We are with you, O son of Jesse! Success, success to you, and success to those who help you, for your God will help you." So David received them and made them leaders of his raiding bands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Some of the men of Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (He and his men did not help the Philistines because, after consultation, their rulers sent him away. They said, "It will cost us our heads if he deserts to his master Saul.")</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">When David went to Ziklag, these were the men of Manasseh who defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu and Zillethai, leaders of units of a thousand in Manasseh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">They helped David against raiding bands, for all of them were brave warriors, and they were commanders in his army.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Day after day men came to help David, until he had a great army, like the army of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">These are the numbers of the men armed for battle who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul's kingdom over to him, as the LORD had said:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">men of Judah, carrying shield and spear-6,800 armed for battle;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">men of Simeon, warriors ready for battle-7,100;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">men of Levi-4,600,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">including Jehoiada, leader of the family of Aaron, with 3,700 men,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">and Zadok, a brave young warrior, with 22 officers from his family;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">men of Benjamin, Saul's kinsmen-3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to Saul's house until then;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">men of Ephraim, brave warriors, famous in their own clans-20,800;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">men of half the tribe of Manasseh, designated by name to come and make David king-18,000;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">men of Issachar, who understood the times and knew what Israel should do-200 chiefs, with all their relatives under their command;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">men of Zebulun, experienced soldiers prepared for battle with every type of weapon, to help David with undivided loyalty-50,000;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">men of Naphtali-1,000 officers, together with 37,000 men carrying shields and spears;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">men of Dan, ready for battle-28,600;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">men of Asher, experienced soldiers prepared for battle-40,000;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">and from east of the Jordan, men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, armed with every type of weapon-120,000.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">All these were fighting men who volunteered to serve in the ranks. They came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of the Israelites were also of one mind to make David king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">The men spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, for their families had supplied provisions for them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Also, their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun and Naphtali came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules and oxen. There were plentiful supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisin cakes, wine, oil, cattle and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
<VERS vnumber="1">David conferred with each of his officers, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He then said to the whole assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you and if it is the will of the LORD our God, let us send word far and wide to the rest of our brothers throughout the territories of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites who are with them in their towns and pasturelands, to come and join us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Let us bring the ark of our God back to us, for we did not inquire of it during the reign of Saul."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The whole assembly agreed to do this, because it seemed right to all the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So David assembled all the Israelites, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">David and all the Israelites with him went to Baalah of Judah (Kiriath Jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD, who is enthroned between the cherubim-the ark that is called by the Name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They moved the ark of God from Abinadab's house on a new cart, with Uzzah and Ahio guiding it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">David and all the Israelites were celebrating with all their might before God, with songs and with harps, lyres, tambourines, cymbals and trumpets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The LORD's anger burned against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then David was angry because the LORD's wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">David was afraid of God that day and asked, "How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He did not take the ark to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house for three months, and the LORD blessed his household and everything he had.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, stonemasons and carpenters to build a palace for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom had been highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">In Jerusalem David took more wives and became the father of more sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went out to meet them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">so David inquired of God: "Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" The LORD answered him, "Go, I will hand them over to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So David and his men went up to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, "As waters break out, God has broken out against my enemies by my hand." So that place was called Baal Perazim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The Philistines had abandoned their gods there, and David gave orders to burn them in the fire.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Once more the Philistines raided the valley;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">so David inquired of God again, and God answered him, "Do not go straight up, but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out to battle, because that will mean God has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army, all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So David's fame spread throughout every land, and the LORD made all the nations fear him.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
<VERS vnumber="1">After David had constructed buildings for himself in the City of David, he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then David said, "No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the LORD chose them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister before him forever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to the place he had prepared for it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He called together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">From the descendants of Kohath, Uriel the leader and 120 relatives;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">from the descendants of Merari, Asaiah the leader and 220 relatives;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">from the descendants of Gershon, Joel the leader and 130 relatives;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">from the descendants of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the leader and 200 relatives;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">from the descendants of Hebron, Eliel the leader and 80 relatives;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">from the descendants of Uzziel, Amminadab the leader and 112 relatives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel and Amminadab the Levites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He said to them, "You are the heads of the Levitical families; you and your fellow Levites are to consecrate yourselves and bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">It was because you, the Levites, did not bring it up the first time that the LORD our God broke out in anger against us. We did not inquire of him about how to do it in the prescribed way."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves in order to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And the Levites carried the ark of God with the poles on their shoulders, as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers to sing joyful songs, accompanied by musical instruments: lyres, harps and cymbals.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his brothers, Asaph son of Berekiah; and from their brothers the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">and with them their brothers next in rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The musicians Heman, Asaph and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah and Benaiah were to play the lyres according to alamoth,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel and Azaziah were to play the harps, directing according to sheminith.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Kenaniah the head Levite was in charge of the singing; that was his responsibility because he was skillful at it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Berekiah and Elkanah were to be doorkeepers for the ark.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah and Eliezer the priests were to blow trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-Edom and Jehiah were also to be doorkeepers for the ark.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-Edom, with rejoicing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Because God had helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, seven bulls and seven rams were sacrificed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Now David was clothed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and as were the singers, and Kenaniah, who was in charge of the singing of the choirs. David also wore a linen ephod.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouts, with the sounding of rams' horns and trumpets, and of cymbals, and the playing of lyres and harps.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">As the ark of the covenant of the LORD was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David dancing and celebrating, she despised him in her heart.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
<VERS vnumber="1">They brought the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and they presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">After David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each Israelite man and woman.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, to make petition, to give thanks, and to praise the LORD, the God of Israel:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Asaph was the chief, Zechariah second, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom and Jeiel. They were to play the lyres and harps, Asaph was to sound the cymbals,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">That day David first committed to Asaph and his associates this psalm of thanks to the LORD:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name; make known among the nations what he has done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">O descendants of Israel his servant, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He remembers his covenant forever, the word he commanded, for a thousand generations,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He allowed no man to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Sing to the LORD, all the earth; proclaim his salvation day after day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">For great is the LORD and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the LORD made the heavens.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and joy in his dwelling place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Ascribe to the LORD, O families of nations, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name. Bring an offering and come before him; worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Tremble before him, all the earth! The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let them say among the nations, "The LORD reigns!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Let the sea resound, and all that is in it; let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Then the trees of the forest will sing, they will sing for joy before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Cry out, "Save us, O God our Savior; gather us and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name, that we may glory in your praise."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Then all the people said "Amen" and "Praise the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">David left Asaph and his associates before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister there regularly, according to each day's requirements.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">He also left Obed-Edom and his sixty-eight associates to minister with them. Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and also Hosah, were gatekeepers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place in Gibeon</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">to present burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering regularly, morning and evening, in accordance with everything written in the Law of the LORD, which he had given Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the LORD, "for his love endures forever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">Heman and Jeduthun were responsible for the sounding of the trumpets and cymbals and for the playing of the other instruments for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were stationed at the gate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">Then all the people left, each for his own home, and David returned home to bless his family.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
<VERS vnumber="1">After David was settled in his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, "Here I am, living in a palace of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Nathan replied to David, "Whatever you have in mind, do it, for God is with you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">That night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day. I have moved from one tent site to another, from one dwelling place to another.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their leaders whom I commanded to shepherd my people, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Now then, tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says: I took you from the pasture and from following the flock, to be ruler over my people Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies. "'I declare to you that the LORD will build a house for you:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When your days are over and you go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him, as I took it away from your predecessor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever; his throne will be established forever.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said: "Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">And as if this were not enough in your sight, O God, you have spoken about the future of the house of your servant. You have looked on me as though I were the most exalted of men, O LORD God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">O LORD. For the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made known all these great promises.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"There is no one like you, O LORD, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">And who is like your people Israel-the one nation on earth whose God went out to redeem a people for himself, and to make a name for yourself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">You made your people Israel your very own forever, and you, O LORD, have become their God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"And now, LORD, let the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house be established forever. Do as you promised,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">so that it will be established and that your name will be great forever. Then men will say, 'The LORD Almighty, the God over Israel, is Israel's God!' And the house of your servant David will be established before you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"You, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. So your servant has found courage to pray to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">O LORD, you are God! You have promised these good things to your servant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, O LORD, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever."</VERS>

So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When David's men came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun, "Do you think David is honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy? Haven't his men come to you to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So Hanun seized David's men, shaved them, cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks, and sent them away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When someone came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, "Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in David's nostrils, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, Aram Maacah and Zobah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and charioteers, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba, while the Ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother, and they were deployed against the Ammonites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Joab said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to rescue me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will rescue you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The LORD will do what is good in his sight."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were fleeing, they too fled before his brother Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the River, with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer's army leading them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan; he advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them. David formed his lines to meet the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the commander of their army.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites anymore.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, Joab led out the armed forces. He laid waste the land of the Ammonites and went to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and left it in ruins.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">David took the crown from the head of their king -its weight was found to be a talent of gold, and it was set with precious stones-and it was placed on David's head. He took a great quantity of plunder from the city</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes. David did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">In the course of time, war broke out with the Philistines, at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaites, and the Philistines were subjugated.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">In another battle with the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver's rod.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot-twenty-four in all. He also was descended from Rapha.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">These were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
<VERS vnumber="1">Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, "Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But Joab replied, "May the LORD multiply his troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all my lord's subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The king's word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the king's command was repulsive to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then David said to God, "I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The LORD said to Gad, David's seer,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Go and tell David, 'This is what the LORD says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So Gad went to David and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Take your choice:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">three years of famine, three months of being swept away before your enemies, with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the LORD -days of plague in the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.' Now then, decide how I should answer the one who sent me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So the LORD sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">David said to God, "Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? O LORD my God, let your hand fall upon me and my family, but do not let this plague remain on your people."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">David said to him, "Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped. Sell it to me at the full price."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Araunah said to David, "Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">But King David replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels of gold for the site.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then the LORD spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">The tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the desert, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">But David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then David said, "The house of the LORD God is to be here, and also the altar of burnt offering for Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So David gave orders to assemble the aliens living in Israel, and from among them he appointed stonecutters to prepare dressed stone for building the house of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, and more bronze than could be weighed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted, for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">David said, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD should be of great magnificence and fame and splendor in the sight of all the nations. Therefore I will make preparations for it." So David made extensive preparations before his death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">David said to Solomon: "My son, I had it in my heart to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But this word of the LORD came to me: 'You have shed much blood and have fought many wars. You are not to build a house for my Name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But you will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. His name will be Solomon, and I will grant Israel peace and quiet during his reign.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He is the one who will build a house for my Name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Now, my son, the LORD be with you, and may you have success and build the house of the LORD your God, as he said you would.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">May the LORD give you discretion and understanding when he puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then you will have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws that the LORD gave Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"I have taken great pains to provide for the temple of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, a million talents of silver, quantities of bronze and iron too great to be weighed, and wood and stone. And you may add to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">You have many workmen: stonecutters, masons and carpenters, as well as men skilled in every kind of work</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">in gold and silver, bronze and iron-craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and the LORD be with you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He said to them, "Is not the LORD your God with you? And has he not granted you rest on every side? For he has handed the inhabitants of the land over to me, and the land is subject to the LORD and to his people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Now devote your heart and soul to seeking the LORD your God. Begin to build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the sacred articles belonging to God into the temple that will be built for the Name of the LORD."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
<VERS vnumber="1">When David was old and full of years, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He also gathered together all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The Levites thirty years old or more were counted, and the total number of men was thirty-eight thousand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">David said, "Of these, twenty-four thousand are to supervise the work of the temple of the LORD and six thousand are to be officials and judges.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Four thousand are to be gatekeepers and four thousand are to praise the LORD with the musical instruments I have provided for that purpose."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">David divided the Levites into groups corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Belonging to the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the first, Zetham and Joel-three in all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel and Haran-three in all. These were the heads of the families of Ladan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Ziza, Jeush and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei-four in all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Jahath was the first and Ziza the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; so they were counted as one family with one assignment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel-four in all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart, he and his descendants forever, to consecrate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices before the LORD, to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in his name forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The sons of Moses the man of God were counted as part of the tribe of Levi.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The descendants of Gershom: Shubael was the first.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The descendants of Eliezer: Rehabiah was the first. Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The sons of Izhar: Shelomith was the first.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The sons of Uzziel: Micah the first and Isshiah the second.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Eleazar died without having sons: he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth-three in all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">These were the descendants of Levi by their families-the heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually, that is, the workers twenty years old or more who served in the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">For David had said, "Since the LORD, the God of Israel, has granted rest to his people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">According to the last instructions of David, the Levites were counted from those twenty years old or more.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">The duty of the Levites was to help Aaron's descendants in the service of the temple of the LORD: to be in charge of the courtyards, the side rooms, the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at the house of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">They were in charge of the bread set out on the table, the flour for the grain offerings, the unleavened wafers, the baking and the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD. They were to do the same in the evening</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">and whenever burnt offerings were presented to the LORD on Sabbaths and at New Moon festivals and at appointed feasts. They were to serve before the LORD regularly in the proper number and in the way prescribed for them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">And so the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting, for the Holy Place and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron, for the service of the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
<VERS vnumber="1">These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron: The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as the priests.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">With the help of Zadok a descendant of Eleazar and Ahimelech a descendant of Ithamar, David separated them into divisions for their appointed order of ministering.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">A larger number of leaders were found among Eleazar's descendants than among Ithamar's, and they were divided accordingly: sixteen heads of families from Eleazar's descendants and eight heads of families from Ithamar's descendants.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">They divided them impartially by drawing lots, for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officials: Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites-one family being taken from Eleazar and then one from Ithamar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="17">the twenty-first to Jakin, the twenty-second to Gamul,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">the twenty-third to Delaiah and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">This was their appointed order of ministering when they entered the temple of the LORD, according to the regulations prescribed for them by their forefather Aaron, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">As for the rest of the descendants of Levi: from the sons of Amram: Shubael; from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">As for Rehabiah, from his sons: Isshiah was the first.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">From the Izharites: Shelomoth; from the sons of Shelomoth: Jahath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="28">From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">From Kish: the son of Kish: Jerahmeel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth. These were the Levites, according to their families.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">They also cast lots, just as their brothers the descendants of Aaron did, in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites. The families of the oldest brother were treated the same as those of the youngest.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
<VERS vnumber="1">David, together with the commanders of the army, set apart some of the sons of Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun for the ministry of prophesying, accompanied by harps, lyres and cymbals. Here is the list of the men who performed this service:</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">But God said to me, 'You are not to build a house for my Name, because you are a warrior and have shed blood.'</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">Besides, in my devotion to the temple of my God I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the temple of my God, over and above everything I have provided for this holy temple:</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="6">Then the leaders of families, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king's work gave willingly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They gave toward the work on the temple of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze and a hundred thousand talents of iron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Any who had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple of the LORD in the custody of Jehiel the Gershonite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the LORD. David the king also rejoiced greatly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">David praised the LORD in the presence of the whole assembly, saying, "Praise be to you, O LORD, God of our father Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor, for everything in heaven and earth is yours. Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom; you are exalted as head over all.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="16">O LORD our God, as for all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name, it comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things have I given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Israel, keep this desire in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands, requirements and decrees and to do everything to build the palatial structure for which I have provided."</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">Solomon son of David established himself firmly over his kingdom, for the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then Solomon spoke to all Israel-to the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, to the judges and to all the leaders in Israel, the heads of families-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon, for God's Tent of Meeting was there, which Moses the LORD's servant had made in the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the LORD; so Solomon and the assembly inquired of him there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Solomon answered God, "You have shown great kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Now, LORD God, let your promise to my father David be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">God said to Solomon, "Since this is your heart's desire and you have not asked for wealth, riches or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, riches and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting. And he reigned over Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue - the royal merchants purchased them from Kue.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">Solomon gave orders to build a temple for the Name of the LORD and a royal palace for himself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He conscripted seventy thousand men as carriers and eighty thousand as stonecutters in the hills and thirty-six hundred as foremen over them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Solomon sent this message to Hiram king of Tyre: "Send me cedar logs as you did for my father David when you sent him cedar to build a palace to live in.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Now I am about to build a temple for the Name of the LORD my God and to dedicate it to him for burning fragrant incense before him, for setting out the consecrated bread regularly, and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening and on Sabbaths and New Moons and at the appointed feasts of the LORD our God. This is a lasting ordinance for Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"The temple I am going to build will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But who is able to build a temple for him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before him?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Send me, therefore, a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, and in purple, crimson and blue yarn, and experienced in the art of engraving, to work in Judah and Jerusalem with my skilled craftsmen, whom my father David provided.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Solomon began to build the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David. It was on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, the place provided by David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He began building on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The foundation Solomon laid for building the temple of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide (using the cubit of the old standard).</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The portico at the front of the temple was twenty cubits long across the width of the building and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He paneled the main hall with pine and covered it with fine gold and decorated it with palm tree and chain designs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He adorned the temple with precious stones. And the gold he used was gold of Parvaim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He overlaid the ceiling beams, doorframes, walls and doors of the temple with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He built the Most Holy Place, its length corresponding to the width of the temple-twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. He overlaid the inside with six hundred talents of fine gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The gold nails weighed fifty shekels. He also overlaid the upper parts with gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">In the Most Holy Place he made a pair of sculptured cherubim and overlaid them with gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The total wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits. One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and touched the temple wall, while its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the other cherub.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Similarly one wing of the second cherub was five cubits long and touched the other temple wall, and its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the first cherub.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, facing the main hall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He made the curtain of blue, purple and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim worked into it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">In the front of the temple he made two pillars, which together were thirty-five cubits long, each with a capital on top measuring five cubits.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He made interwoven chains and put them on top of the pillars. He also made a hundred pomegranates and attached them to the chains.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He erected the pillars in the front of the temple, one to the south and one to the north. The one to the south he named Jakin and the one to the north Boaz.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">He made a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Below the rim, figures of bulls encircled it-ten to a cubit. The bulls were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held three thousand baths.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He then made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north. In them the things to be used for the burnt offerings were rinsed, but the Sea was to be used by the priests for washing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He made ten gold lampstands according to the specifications for them and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold sprinkling bowls.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He made the courtyard of the priests, and the large court and the doors for the court, and overlaid the doors with bronze.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of God:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">the stands with their basins;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">the pots, shovels, meat forks and all related articles. All the objects that Huram-Abi made for King Solomon for the temple of the LORD were of polished bronze.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">All these things that Solomon made amounted to so much that the weight of the bronze was not determined.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in God's temple: the golden altar; the tables on which was the bread of the Presence;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">the lampstands of pure gold with their lamps, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">the gold floral work and lamps and tongs (they were solid gold);</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">When all the work Solomon had done for the temple of the LORD was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated-the silver and gold and all the furnishings-and he placed them in the treasuries of God's temple.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">And all the men of Israel came together to the king at the time of the festival in the seventh month.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">and they brought up the ark and the Tent of Meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The priests, who were Levites, carried them up;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The priests then brought the ark of the LORD's covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and covered the ark and its carrying poles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">These poles were so long that their ends, extending from the ark, could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The priests then withdrew from the Holy Place. All the priests who were there had consecrated themselves, regardless of their divisions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">All the Levites who were musicians-Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun and their sons and relatives-stood on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps and lyres. They were accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The trumpeters and singers joined in unison, as with one voice, to give praise and thanks to the LORD. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals and other instruments, they raised their voices in praise to the LORD and sang: "He is good; his love endures forever." Then the temple of the LORD was filled with a cloud,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the temple of God.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I have built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then he said: "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hands has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David. For he said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">'Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built for my Name to be there, nor have I chosen anyone to be the leader over my people Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But now I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But the LORD said to my father David, 'Because it was in your heart to build a temple for my Name, you did well to have this in your heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, who is your own flesh and blood-he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"The LORD has kept the promise he made. I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">There I have placed the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with the people of Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Now he had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high, and had placed it in the center of the outer court. He stood on the platform and then knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He said: "O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven or on earth-you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it-as it is today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Now LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said, 'You shall never fail to have a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons are careful in all they do to walk before me according to my law, as you have done.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">And now, O LORD, God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David come true.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"But will God really dwell on earth with men? The heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Yet give attention to your servant's prayer and his plea for mercy, O LORD my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">May your eyes be open toward this temple day and night, this place of which you said you would put your Name there. May you hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Hear the supplications of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"When a man wrongs his neighbor and is required to take an oath and he comes and swears the oath before your altar in this temple,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">then hear from heaven and act. Judge between your servants, repaying the guilty by bringing down on his own head what he has done. Declare the innocent not guilty and so establish his innocence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"When your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you and when they turn back and confess your name, praying and making supplication before you in this temple,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land you gave to them and their fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">"When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and confess your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">"When famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when enemies besiege them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">and when a prayer or plea is made by any of your people Israel-each one aware of his afflictions and pains, and spreading out his hands toward this temple-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive, and deal with each man according to all he does, since you know his heart (for you alone know the hearts of men),</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">so that they will fear you and walk in your ways all the time they live in the land you gave our fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">"As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm-when he comes and prays toward this temple,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">then hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">"When your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send them, and when they pray to you toward this city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">"When they sin against you-for there is no one who does not sin-and you become angry with them and give them over to the enemy, who takes them captive to a land far away or near;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captivity and say, 'We have sinned, we have done wrong and acted wickedly';</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity where they were taken, and pray toward the land you gave their fathers, toward the city you have chosen and toward the temple I have built for your Name;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">then from heaven, your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their pleas, and uphold their cause. And forgive your people, who have sinned against you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">"Now, my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">"Now arise, O LORD God, and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. May your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, may your saints rejoice in your goodness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">O LORD God, do not reject your anointed one. Remember the great love promised to David your servant."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The priests could not enter the temple of the LORD because the glory of the LORD filled it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the LORD above the temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, "He is good; his love endures forever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the people dedicated the temple of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The priests took their positions, as did the Levites with the LORD's musical instruments, which King David had made for praising the LORD and which were used when he gave thanks, saying, "His love endures forever." Opposite the Levites, the priests blew their trumpets, and all the Israelites were standing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the LORD, and there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar he had made could not hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat portions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So Solomon observed the festival at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him-a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">On the eighth day they held an assembly, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days more.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their homes, joyful and glad in heart for the good things the LORD had done for David and Solomon and for his people Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When Solomon had finished the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and had succeeded in carrying out all he had in mind to do in the temple of the LORD and in his own palace,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">the LORD appeared to him at night and said: "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">I have chosen and consecrated this temple so that my Name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"As for you, if you walk before me as David your father did, and do all I command, and observe my decrees and laws,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father when I said, 'You shall never fail to have a man to rule over Israel.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"But if you turn away and forsake the decrees and commands I have given you and go off to serve other gods and worship them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">then I will uproot Israel from my land, which I have given them, and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. I will make it a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">And though this temple is now so imposing, all who pass by will be appalled and say, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">People will answer, 'Because they have forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them-that is why he brought all this disaster on them.'"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built the temple of the LORD and his own palace,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Solomon rebuilt the villages that Hiram had given him, and settled Israelites in them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Solomon then went to Hamath Zobah and captured it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He also built up Tadmor in the desert and all the store cities he had built in Hamath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon as fortified cities, with walls and with gates and bars,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">as well as Baalath and all his store cities, and all the cities for his chariots and for his horses -whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">All the people left from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these peoples were not Israelites),</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">that is, their descendants remaining in the land, whom the Israelites had not destroyed-these Solomon conscripted for his slave labor force, as it is to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites for his work; they were his fighting men, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and charioteers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">They were also King Solomon's chief officials-two hundred and fifty officials supervising the men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her, for he said, "My wife must not live in the palace of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the LORD has entered are holy."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">On the altar of the LORD that he had built in front of the portico, Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the LORD,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">according to the daily requirement for offerings commanded by Moses for Sabbaths, New Moons and the three annual feasts-the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Tabernacles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">In keeping with the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their duties, and the Levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to each day's requirement. He also appointed the gatekeepers by divisions for the various gates, because this was what David the man of God had ordered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">They did not deviate from the king's commands to the priests or to the Levites in any matter, including that of the treasuries.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">All Solomon's work was carried out, from the day the foundation of the temple of the LORD was laid until its completion. So the temple of the LORD was finished.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the coast of Edom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And Hiram sent him ships commanded by his own officers, men who knew the sea. These, with Solomon's men, sailed to Ophir and brought back four hundred and fifty talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. Arriving with a very great caravan-with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones-she came to Solomon and talked with him about all she had on her mind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for him to explain to her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, as well as the palace he had built,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, the cupbearers in their robes and the burnt offerings he made at the temple of the LORD, she was overwhelmed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">She said to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But I did not believe what they said until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half the greatness of your wisdom was told me; you have far exceeded the report I heard.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">How happy your men must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on his throne as king to rule for the LORD your God. Because of the love of your God for Israel and his desire to uphold them forever, he has made you king over them, to maintain justice and righteousness."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. There had never been such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">(The men of Hiram and the men of Solomon brought gold from Ophir; they also brought algumwood and precious stones.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The king used the algumwood to make steps for the temple of the LORD and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. Nothing like them had ever been seen in Judah.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for; he gave her more than she had brought to him. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">not including the revenues brought in by merchants and traders. Also all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred bekas of hammered gold went into each shield.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, with three hundred bekas of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then the king made a great throne inlaid with ivory and overlaid with pure gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to it. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">All King Solomon's goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon's day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The king had a fleet of trading ships manned by Hiram's men. Once every three years it returned, carrying gold, silver and ivory, and apes and baboons.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">All the kings of the earth sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Year after year, everyone who came brought a gift-articles of silver and gold, and robes, weapons and spices, and horses and mules.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He ruled over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from all other countries.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">As for the other events of Solomon's reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Then he rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all the Israelites had gone there to make him king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Rehoboam answered, "Come back to me in three days." So the people went away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. "How would you advise me to answer these people?" he asked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They replied, "If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He asked them, "What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The young men who had grown up with him replied, "Tell the people who have said to you, 'Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter'-tell them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, "Come back to me in three days."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The king answered them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">he followed the advice of the young men and said, "My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: "What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse's son? To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, O David!" So all the Israelites went home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, who was in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered the house of Judah and Benjamin-a hundred and eighty thousand fighting men-to make war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">But this word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and to all the Israelites in Judah and Benjamin,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">'This is what the LORD says: Do not go up to fight against your brothers. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.'" So they obeyed the words of the LORD and turned back from marching against Jeroboam.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built up towns for defense in Judah:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron. These were fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He strengthened their defenses and put commanders in them, with supplies of food, olive oil and wine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He put shields and spears in all the cities, and made them very strong. So Judah and Benjamin were his.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel sided with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property, and came to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he had made.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Those from every tribe of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the LORD, the God of Israel, followed the Levites to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the LORD, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon three years, walking in the ways of David and Solomon during this time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Rehoboam married Mahalath, who was the daughter of David's son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse's son Eliab.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah and Zaham.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then he married Maacah daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than any of his other wives and concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah to be the chief prince among his brothers, in order to make him king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">He acted wisely, dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities. He gave them abundant provisions and took many wives for them.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
<VERS vnumber="1">After Rehoboam's position as king was established and he had become strong, he and all Israel with him abandoned the law of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen and the innumerable troops of Libyans, Sukkites and Cushites that came with him from Egypt,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">he captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who had assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak, and he said to them, "This is what the LORD says, 'You have abandoned me; therefore, I now abandon you to Shishak.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, "The LORD is just."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, this word of the LORD came to Shemaiah: "Since they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them but will soon give them deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">They will, however, become subject to him, so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">When Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem, he carried off the treasures of the temple of the LORD and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields Solomon had made.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Whenever the king went to the LORD's temple, the guards went with him, bearing the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the LORD's anger turned from him, and he was not totally destroyed. Indeed, there was some good in Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">King Rehoboam established himself firmly in Jerusalem and continued as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mother's name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He did evil because he had not set his heart on seeking the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">As for the events of Rehoboam's reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer that deal with genealogies? There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And Abijah his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, Abijah became king of Judah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother's name was Maacah, a daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Abijah went into battle with a force of four hundred thousand able fighting men, and Jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, "Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Don't you know that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, an official of Solomon son of David, rebelled against his master.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"And now you plan to resist the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hands of David's descendants. You are indeed a vast army and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But didn't you drive out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"As for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. The priests who serve the LORD are sons of Aaron, and the Levites assist them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the LORD. They set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We are observing the requirements of the LORD our God. But you have forsaken him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">God is with us; he is our leader. His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. Men of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you will not succeed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah the ambush was behind them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Judah turned and saw that they were being attacked at both front and rear. Then they cried out to the LORD. The priests blew their trumpets</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. At the sound of their battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Abijah and his men inflicted heavy losses on them, so that there were five hundred thousand casualties among Israel's able men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The men of Israel were subdued on that occasion, and the men of Judah were victorious because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron, with their surrounding villages.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Jeroboam did not regain power during the time of Abijah. And the LORD struck him down and he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But Abijah grew in strength. He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The other events of Abijah's reign, what he did and what he said, are written in the annotations of the prophet Iddo.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
<VERS vnumber="1">And Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. Asa his son succeeded him as king, and in his days the country was at peace for ten years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He removed the foreign altars and the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to obey his laws and commands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He removed the high places and incense altars in every town in Judah, and the kingdom was at peace under him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He built up the fortified cities of Judah, since the land was at peace. No one was at war with him during those years, for the LORD gave him rest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Let us build up these towns," he said to Judah, "and put walls around them, with towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the LORD our God; we sought him and he has given us rest on every side." So they built and prospered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah, equipped with large shields and with spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand from Benjamin, armed with small shields and with bows. All these were brave fighting men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Zerah the Cushite marched out against them with a vast army and three hundred chariots, and came as far as Mareshah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Asa went out to meet him, and they took up battle positions in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then Asa called to the LORD his God and said, "LORD, there is no one like you to help the powerless against the mighty. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this vast army. O LORD, you are our God; do not let man prevail against you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The LORD struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah. The Cushites fled,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">and Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. Such a great number of Cushites fell that they could not recover; they were crushed before the LORD and his forces. The men of Judah carried off a large amount of plunder.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They destroyed all the villages around Gerar, for the terror of the LORD had fallen upon them. They plundered all these villages, since there was much booty there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">They also attacked the camps of the herdsmen and carried off droves of sheep and goats and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
<VERS vnumber="1">The Spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He went out to meet Asa and said to him, "Listen to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin. The LORD is with you when you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">For a long time Israel was without the true God, without a priest to teach and without the law.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought him, and he was found by them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">In those days it was not safe to travel about, for all the inhabitants of the lands were in great turmoil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">One nation was being crushed by another and one city by another, because God was troubling them with every kind of distress.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But as for you, be strong and do not give up, for your work will be rewarded."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet, he took courage. He removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin and from the towns he had captured in the hills of Ephraim. He repaired the altar of the LORD that was in front of the portico of the LORD's temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then he assembled all Judah and Benjamin and the people from Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon who had settled among them, for large numbers had come over to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">They assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's reign.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">At that time they sacrificed to the LORD seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep and goats from the plunder they had brought back.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">All who would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, were to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They took an oath to the LORD with loud acclamation, with shouting and with trumpets and horns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">All Judah rejoiced about the oath because they had sworn it wholeheartedly. They sought God eagerly, and he was found by them. So the LORD gave them rest on every side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">King Asa also deposed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother, because she had made a repulsive Asherah pole. Asa cut the pole down, broke it up and burned it in the Kidron Valley.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Although he did not remove the high places from Israel, Asa's heart was fully committed to the LORD all his life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He brought into the temple of God the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Asa then took the silver and gold out of the treasuries of the LORD's temple and of his own palace and sent it to Ben-Hadad king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"Let there be a treaty between me and you," he said, "as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim and all the store cities of Naphtali.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and abandoned his work.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah, and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using. With them he built up Geba and Mizpah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him: "Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Were not the Cushites and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen? Yet when you relied on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">For the eyes of the LORD range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Asa was angry with the seer because of this; he was so enraged that he put him in prison. At the same time Asa brutally oppressed some of the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The events of Asa's reign, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was afflicted with a disease in his feet. Though his disease was severe, even in his illness he did not seek help from the LORD, but only from the physicians.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then in the forty-first year of his reign Asa died and rested with his fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They buried him in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bier covered with spices and various blended perfumes, and they made a huge fire in his honor.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
<VERS vnumber="1">Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king and strengthened himself against Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because in his early years he walked in the ways his father David had followed. He did not consult the Baals</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">but sought the God of his father and followed his commands rather than the practices of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The LORD established the kingdom under his control; and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, so that he had great wealth and honor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">His heart was devoted to the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and the Asherah poles from Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the towns of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">With them were certain Levites-Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tob-Adonijah-and the priests Elishama and Jehoram.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD; they went around to all the towns of Judah and taught the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, so that they did not make war with Jehoshaphat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought him flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred goats.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful; he built forts and store cities in Judah</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">and had large supplies in the towns of Judah. He also kept experienced fighting men in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Their enrollment by families was as follows: From Judah, commanders of units of 1,000: Adnah the commander, with 300,000 fighting men;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">next, Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">next, Amasiah son of Zicri, who volunteered himself for the service of the LORD, with 200,000.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">From Benjamin: Eliada, a valiant soldier, with 200,000 men armed with bows and shields;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">next, Jehozabad, with 180,000 men armed for battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Some years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack Ramoth Gilead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will join you in the war."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "First seek the counsel of the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So the king of Israel brought together the prophets-four hundred men-and asked them, "Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?Go," they answered, "for God will give it into the king's hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD here whom we can inquire of?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.The king should not say that," Jehoshaphat replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance to the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns, and he declared, "This is what the LORD says: 'With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. "Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious," they said, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, as one man the other prophets are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But Micaiah said, "As surely as the LORD lives, I can tell him only what my God says."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">When he arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?Attack and be victorious," he answered, "for they will be given into your hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Micaiah continued, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing on his right and on his left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab king of Israel into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?'"One suggested this, and another that.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD and said, 'I will entice him.'"'By what means?' the LORD asked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"'I will go and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. "'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the LORD. 'Go and do it.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"So now the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours. The LORD has decreed disaster for you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. "Which way did the spirit from the LORD go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king's son,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">and say, 'This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Mark my words, all you people!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "This is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">for when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told the chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">All day long the battle raged, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. Then at sunset he died.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Jehu the seer, the son of Hanani, went out to meet him and said to the king, "Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Because of this, the wrath of the LORD is upon you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">There is, however, some good in you, for you have rid the land of the Asherah poles and have set your heart on seeking God."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and turned them back to the LORD, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He appointed judges in the land, in each of the fortified cities of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He told them, "Consider carefully what you do, because you are not judging for man but for the LORD, who is with you whenever you give a verdict.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now let the fear of the LORD be upon you. Judge carefully, for with the LORD our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites, priests and heads of Israelite families to administer the law of the LORD and to settle disputes. And they lived in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He gave them these orders: "You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">In every case that comes before you from your fellow countrymen who live in the cities-whether bloodshed or other concerns of the law, commands, decrees or ordinances-you are to warn them not to sin against the LORD; otherwise his wrath will come on you and your brothers. Do this, and you will not sin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Amariah the chief priest will be over you in any matter concerning the LORD, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the tribe of Judah, will be over you in any matter concerning the king, and the Levites will serve as officials before you. Act with courage, and may the LORD be with those who do well."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
<VERS vnumber="1">After this, the Moabites and Ammonites with some of the Meunites came to make war on Jehoshaphat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Some men came and told Jehoshaphat, "A vast army is coming against you from Edom, from the other side of the Sea. It is already in Hazazon Tamar" (that is, En Gedi).</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Alarmed, Jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the LORD, and he proclaimed a fast for all Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The people of Judah came together to seek help from the LORD; indeed, they came from every town in Judah to seek him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the temple of the LORD in the front of the new courtyard</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">and said: "O LORD, God of our fathers, are you not the God who is in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. Power and might are in your hand, and no one can withstand you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">O our God, did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">They have lived in it and have built in it a sanctuary for your Name, saying,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">'If calamity comes upon us, whether the sword of judgment, or plague or famine, we will stand in your presence before this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our distress, and you will hear us and save us.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"But now here are men from Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, whose territory you would not allow Israel to invade when they came from Egypt; so they turned away from them and did not destroy them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">O our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">All the men of Judah, with their wives and children and little ones, stood there before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite and descendant of Asaph, as he stood in the assembly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He said: "Listen, King Jehoshaphat and all who live in Judah and Jerusalem! This is what the LORD says to you: 'Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God's.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Tomorrow march down against them. They will be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">You will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions; stand firm and see the deliverance the LORD will give you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow, and the LORD will be with you.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Jehoshaphat bowed with his face to the ground, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and praised the LORD, the God of Israel, with very loud voice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Early in the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Have faith in the LORD your God and you will be upheld; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">After consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the LORD and to praise him for the splendor of his holiness as they went out at the head of the army, saying: "Give thanks to the LORD, for his love endures forever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">As they began to sing and praise, the LORD set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The men of Ammon and Moab rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them. After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped to destroy one another.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">When the men of Judah came to the place that overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army, they saw only dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">So Jehoshaphat and his men went to carry off their plunder, and they found among them a great amount of equipment and clothing and also articles of value-more than they could take away. There was so much plunder that it took three days to collect it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah, where they praised the LORD. This is why it is called the Valley of Beracah to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then, led by Jehoshaphat, all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for the LORD had given them cause to rejoice over their enemies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">They entered Jerusalem and went to the temple of the LORD with harps and lutes and trumpets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">The fear of God came upon all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard how the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">He walked in the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">The high places, however, were not removed, and the people still had not set their hearts on the God of their fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">The other events of Jehoshaphat's reign, from beginning to end, are written in the annals of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, who was guilty of wickedness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">He agreed with him to construct a fleet of trading ships. After these were built at Ezion Geber,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, "Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah, the LORD will destroy what you have made." The ships were wrecked and were not able to set sail to trade.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Jehoram's brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and articles of value, as well as fortified cities in Judah, but he had given the kingdom to Jehoram because he was his firstborn son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When Jehoram established himself firmly over his father's kingdom, he put all his brothers to the sword along with some of the princes of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Nevertheless, because of the covenant the LORD had made with David, the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David. He had promised to maintain a lamp for him and his descendants forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So Jehoram went there with his officers and all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time, because Jehoram had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He had also built high places on the hills of Judah and had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves and had led Judah astray.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet, which said: "This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: 'You have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But you have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and you have led Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, just as the house of Ahab did. You have also murdered your own brothers, members of your father's house, men who were better than you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So now the LORD is about to strike your people, your sons, your wives and everything that is yours, with a heavy blow.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">You yourself will be very ill with a lingering disease of the bowels, until the disease causes your bowels to come out.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The LORD aroused against Jehoram the hostility of the Philistines and of the Arabs who lived near the Cushites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They attacked Judah, invaded it and carried off all the goods found in the king's palace, together with his sons and wives. Not a son was left to him except Ahaziah, the youngest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">After all this, the LORD afflicted Jehoram with an incurable disease of the bowels.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">In the course of time, at the end of the second year, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great pain. His people made no fire in his honor, as they had for his fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He passed away, to no one's regret, and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
<VERS vnumber="1">The people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, Jehoram's youngest son, king in his place, since the raiders, who came with the Arabs into the camp, had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He too walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother encouraged him in doing wrong.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for after his father's death they became his advisers, to his undoing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He also followed their counsel when he went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on him at Ramoth in his battle with Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab because he had been wounded.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Through Ahaziah's visit to Joram, God brought about Ahaziah's downfall. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">While Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's relatives, who had been attending Ahaziah, and he killed them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He then went in search of Ahaziah, and his men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. He was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, "He was a son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart." So there was no one in the house of Ahaziah powerful enough to retain the kingdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family of the house of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes who were about to be murdered and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Because Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of the priest Jehoiada, was Ahaziah's sister, she hid the child from Athaliah so she could not kill him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He remained hidden with them at the temple of God for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the seventh year Jehoiada showed his strength. He made a covenant with the commanders of units of a hundred: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zicri.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites and the heads of Israelite families from all the towns. When they came to Jerusalem,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">the whole assembly made a covenant with the king at the temple of God. Jehoiada said to them, "The king's son shall reign, as the LORD promised concerning the descendants of David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Now this is what you are to do: A third of you priests and Levites who are going on duty on the Sabbath are to keep watch at the doors,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">a third of you at the royal palace and a third at the Foundation Gate, and all the other men are to be in the courtyards of the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">No one is to enter the temple of the LORD except the priests and Levites on duty; they may enter because they are consecrated, but all the other men are to guard what the LORD has assigned to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The Levites are to station themselves around the king, each man with his weapons in his hand. Anyone who enters the temple must be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The Levites and all the men of Judah did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men-those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty-for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then he gave the commanders of units of a hundred the spears and the large and small shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He stationed all the men, each with his weapon in his hand, around the king-near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Jehoiada and his sons brought out the king's son and put the crown on him; they presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him and shouted, "Long live the king!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the king, she went to them at the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">She looked, and there was the king, standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and singers with musical instruments were leading the praises. Then Athaliah tore her robes and shouted, "Treason! Treason!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops, and said to them: "Bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her." For the priest had said, "Do not put her to death at the temple of the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So they seized her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, and there they put her to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Jehoiada then made a covenant that he and the people and the king would be the LORD's people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">All the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then Jehoiada placed the oversight of the temple of the LORD in the hands of the priests, who were Levites, to whom David had made assignments in the temple, to present the burnt offerings of the LORD as written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and singing, as David had ordered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He also stationed doorkeepers at the gates of the LORD's temple so that no one who was in any way unclean might enter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the temple of the LORD. They went into the palace through the Upper Gate and seated the king on the royal throne,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">and all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quiet, because Athaliah had been slain with the sword.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
<VERS vnumber="1">Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother's name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the years of Jehoiada the priest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Jehoiada chose two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Some time later Joash decided to restore the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He called together the priests and Levites and said to them, "Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel, to repair the temple of your God. Do it now." But the Levites did not act at once.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, "Why haven't you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD and by the assembly of Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the temple of God and had used even its sacred objects for the Baals.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">At the king's command, a chest was made and placed outside, at the gate of the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">A proclamation was then issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they should bring to the LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God had required of Israel in the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">All the officials and all the people brought their contributions gladly, dropping them into the chest until it was full.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Whenever the chest was brought in by the Levites to the king's officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They did this regularly and collected a great amount of money.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The king and Jehoiada gave it to the men who carried out the work required for the temple of the LORD. They hired masons and carpenters to restore the LORD's temple, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The men in charge of the work were diligent, and the repairs progressed under them. They rebuilt the temple of God according to its original design and reinforced it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made articles for the LORD's temple: articles for the service and for the burnt offerings, and also dishes and other objects of gold and silver. As long as Jehoiada lived, burnt offerings were presented continually in the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Now Jehoiada was old and full of years, and he died at the age of a hundred and thirty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He was buried with the kings in the City of David, because of the good he had done in Israel for God and his temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">After the death of Jehoiada, the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and he listened to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">They abandoned the temple of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and worshiped Asherah poles and idols. Because of their guilt, God's anger came upon Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Although the LORD sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him, and though they testified against them, they would not listen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and said, "This is what God says: 'Why do you disobey the LORD's commands? You will not prosper. Because you have forsaken the LORD, he has forsaken you.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But they plotted against him, and by order of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the LORD's temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">King Joash did not remember the kindness Zechariah's father Jehoiada had shown him but killed his son, who said as he lay dying, "May the LORD see this and call you to account."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">At the turn of the year, the army of Aram marched against Joash; it invaded Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the leaders of the people. They sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men, the LORD delivered into their hands a much larger army. Because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, judgment was executed on Joash.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">When the Arameans withdrew, they left Joash severely wounded. His officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him in his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Those who conspired against him were Zabad, son of Shimeath an Ammonite woman, and Jehozabad, son of Shimrith a Moabite woman.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The account of his sons, the many prophecies about him, and the record of the restoration of the temple of God are written in the annotations on the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
<VERS vnumber="1">Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother's name was Jehoaddin; she was from Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not wholeheartedly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">After the kingdom was firmly in his control, he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Yet he did not put their sons to death, but acted in accordance with what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded: "Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sins."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He then mustered those twenty years old or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men ready for military service, able to handle the spear and shield.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He also hired a hundred thousand fighting men from Israel for a hundred talents of silver.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But a man of God came to him and said, "O king, these troops from Israel must not march with you, for the LORD is not with Israel-not with any of the people of Ephraim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Even if you go and fight courageously in battle, God will overthrow you before the enemy, for God has the power to help or to overthrow."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Amaziah asked the man of God, "But what about the hundred talents I paid for these Israelite troops?" The man of God replied, "The LORD can give you much more than that."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. They were furious with Judah and left for home in a great rage.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Amaziah then marshaled his strength and led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he killed ten thousand men of Seir.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The army of Judah also captured ten thousand men alive, took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to take part in the war raided Judean towns from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down to them and burned sacrifices to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said, "Why do you consult this people's gods, which could not save their own people from your hand?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">While he was still speaking, the king said to him, "Have we appointed you an adviser to the king? Stop! Why be struck down?" So the prophet stopped but said, "I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, he sent this challenge to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel: "Come, meet me face to face."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: "A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom, and now you are arrogant and proud. But stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Amaziah, however, would not listen, for God so worked that he might hand them over to Jehoash, because they sought the gods of Edom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Judah was routed by Israel, and every man fled to his home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh. Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate-a section about six hundred feet long.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of God that had been in the care of Obed-Edom, together with the palace treasures and the hostages, and returned to Samaria.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">As for the other events of Amaziah's reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, they conspired against him in Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">He was brought back by horse and was buried with his fathers in the City of Judah.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after Amaziah rested with his fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother's name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. As long as he sought the LORD, God gave him success.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He went to war against the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod. He then rebuilt towns near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal and against the Meunites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt, because he had become very powerful.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate and at the angle of the wall, and he fortified them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He also built towers in the desert and dug many cisterns, because he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain. He had people working his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Uzziah had a well-trained army, ready to go out by divisions according to their numbers as mustered by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one of the royal officials.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2,600.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Under their command was an army of 307,500 men trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against his enemies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmets, coats of armor, bows and slingstones for the entire army.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">In Jerusalem he made machines designed by skillful men for use on the towers and on the corner defenses to shoot arrows and hurl large stones. His fame spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became powerful.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the LORD his God, and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests of the LORD followed him in.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">They confronted him and said, "It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD. That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who have been consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful; and you will not be honored by the LORD God."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in the LORD's temple, leprosy broke out on his forehead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself was eager to leave, because the LORD had afflicted him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a separate house -leprous, and excluded from the temple of the LORD. Jotham his son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The other events of Uzziah's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Uzziah rested with his fathers and was buried near them in a field for burial that belonged to the kings, for people said, "He had leprosy." And Jotham his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple of the LORD and did extensive work on the wall at the hill of Ophel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He built towns in the Judean hills and forts and towers in the wooded areas.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Jotham made war on the king of the Ammonites and conquered them. That year the Ammonites paid him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat and ten thousand cors of barley. The Ammonites brought him the same amount also in the second and third years.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="2">He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and also made cast idols for worshiping the Baals.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He burned sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his sons in the fire, following the detestable ways of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops and under every spreading tree.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Therefore the LORD his God handed him over to the king of Aram. The Arameans defeated him and took many of his people as prisoners and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hands of the king of Israel, who inflicted heavy casualties on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">In one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judah-because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Zicri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed Maaseiah the king's son, Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, second to the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The Israelites took captive from their kinsmen two hundred thousand wives, sons and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder, which they carried back to Samaria.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army when it returned to Samaria. He said to them, "Because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches to heaven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And now you intend to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves. But aren't you also guilty of sins against the LORD your God?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Now listen to me! Send back your fellow countrymen you have taken as prisoners, for the LORD's fierce anger rests on you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then some of the leaders in Ephraim-Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berekiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai-confronted those who were arriving from the war.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"You must not bring those prisoners here," they said, "or we will be guilty before the LORD. Do you intend to add to our sin and guilt? For our guilt is already great, and his fierce anger rests on Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So the soldiers gave up the prisoners and plunder in the presence of the officials and all the assembly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The men designated by name took the prisoners, and from the plunder they clothed all who were naked. They provided them with clothes and sandals, food and drink, and healing balm. All those who were weak they put on donkeys. So they took them back to their fellow countrymen at Jericho, the City of Palms, and returned to Samaria.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The Edomites had again come and attacked Judah and carried away prisoners,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="21">Ahaz took some of the things from the temple of the LORD and from the royal palace and from the princes and presented them to the king of Assyria, but that did not help him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">In his time of trouble King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus, who had defeated him; for he thought, "Since the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them, I will sacrifice to them so they will help me." But they were his downfall and the downfall of all Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Ahaz gathered together the furnishings from the temple of God and took them away. He shut the doors of the LORD's temple and set up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="5">and said: "Listen to me, Levites! Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the LORD, the God of your fathers. Remove all defilement from the sanctuary.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Our fathers were unfaithful; they did evil in the eyes of the LORD our God and forsook him. They turned their faces away from the LORD's dwelling place and turned their backs on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They also shut the doors of the portico and put out the lamps. They did not burn incense or present any burnt offerings at the sanctuary to the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Therefore, the anger of the LORD has fallen on Judah and Jerusalem; he has made them an object of dread and horror and scorn, as you can see with your own eyes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">This is why our fathers have fallen by the sword and why our sons and daughters and our wives are in captivity.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Now I intend to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger will turn away from us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">My sons, do not be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to stand before him and serve him, to minister before him and to burn incense."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then these Levites set to work: from the Kohathites, Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah; from the Merarites, Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel; from the Gershonites, Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">from the descendants of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; from the descendants of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">from the descendants of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; from the descendants of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When they had assembled their brothers and consecrated themselves, they went in to purify the temple of the LORD, as the king had ordered, following the word of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The priests went into the sanctuary of the LORD to purify it. They brought out to the courtyard of the LORD's temple everything unclean that they found in the temple of the LORD. The Levites took it and carried it out to the Kidron Valley.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the LORD. For eight more days they consecrated the temple of the LORD itself, finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then they went in to King Hezekiah and reported: "We have purified the entire temple of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table for setting out the consecrated bread, with all its articles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">We have prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz removed in his unfaithfulness while he was king. They are now in front of the LORD's altar."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials together and went up to the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary and for Judah. The king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer these on the altar of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar; next they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled their blood on the altar; then they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled their blood on the altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The priests then slaughtered the goats and presented their blood on the altar for a sin offering to atone for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">He stationed the Levites in the temple of the LORD with cymbals, harps and lyres in the way prescribed by David and Gad the king's seer and Nathan the prophet; this was commanded by the LORD through his prophets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">So the Levites stood ready with David's instruments, and the priests with their trumpets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. As the offering began, singing to the LORD began also, accompanied by trumpets and the instruments of David king of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">The whole assembly bowed in worship, while the singers sang and the trumpeters played. All this continued until the sacrifice of the burnt offering was completed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">When the offerings were finished, the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed their heads and worshiped.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Then Hezekiah said, "You have now dedicated yourselves to the LORD. Come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the temple of the LORD." So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams and two hundred male lambs-all of them for burnt offerings to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">The animals consecrated as sacrifices amounted to six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">The priests, however, were too few to skin all the burnt offerings; so their kinsmen the Levites helped them until the task was finished and until other priests had been consecrated, for the Levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had been.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">There were burnt offerings in abundance, together with the fat of the fellowship offerings and the drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings. So the service of the temple of the LORD was reestablished.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had brought about for his people, because it was done so quickly.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="30">
<VERS vnumber="1">Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">They had not been able to celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The plan seemed right both to the king and to the whole assembly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">They decided to send a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, calling the people to come to Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel. It had not been celebrated in large numbers according to what was written.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">At the king's command, couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and from his officials, which read: "People of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that he may return to you who are left, who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Do not be like your fathers and brothers, who were unfaithful to the LORD, the God of their fathers, so that he made them an object of horror, as you see.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Do not be stiff-necked, as your fathers were; submit to the LORD. Come to the sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever. Serve the LORD your God, so that his fierce anger will turn away from you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">If you return to the LORD, then your brothers and your children will be shown compassion by their captors and will come back to this land, for the LORD your God is gracious and compassionate. He will not turn his face from you if you return to him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The couriers went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun, but the people scorned and ridiculed them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Nevertheless, some men of Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Also in Judah the hand of God was on the people to give them unity of mind to carry out what the king and his officials had ordered, following the word of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">A very large crowd of people assembled in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They removed the altars in Jerusalem and cleared away the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then they took up their regular positions as prescribed in the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood handed to them by the Levites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Since many in the crowd had not consecrated themselves, the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and could not consecrate their lambs to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Although most of the many people who came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "May the LORD, who is good, pardon everyone</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">who sets his heart on seeking God-the LORD, the God of his fathers-even if he is not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great rejoicing, while the Levites and priests sang to the LORD every day, accompanied by the LORD's instruments of praise.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites, who showed good understanding of the service of the LORD. For the seven days they ate their assigned portion and offered fellowship offerings and praised the LORD, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The whole assembly then agreed to celebrate the festival seven more days; so for another seven days they celebrated joyfully.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Hezekiah king of Judah provided a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep and goats for the assembly, and the officials provided them with a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep and goats. A great number of priests consecrated themselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced, along with the priests and Levites and all who had assembled from Israel, including the aliens who had come from Israel and those who lived in Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The priests and the Levites stood to bless the people, and God heard them, for their prayer reached heaven, his holy dwelling place.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="31">
<VERS vnumber="1">When all this had ended, the Israelites who were there went out to the towns of Judah, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. They destroyed the high places and the altars throughout Judah and Benjamin and in Ephraim and Manasseh. After they had destroyed all of them, the Israelites returned to their own towns and to their own property.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Hezekiah assigned the priests and Levites to divisions-each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites-to offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, to minister, to give thanks and to sing praises at the gates of the LORD's dwelling.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The king contributed from his own possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moons and appointed feasts as written in the Law of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves to the Law of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain, new wine, oil and honey and all that the fields produced. They brought a great amount, a tithe of everything.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The men of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the LORD their God, and they piled them in heaps.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They began doing this in the third month and finished in the seventh month.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the LORD and blessed his people Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">and Azariah the chief priest, from the family of Zadok, answered, "Since the people began to bring their contributions to the temple of the LORD, we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare, because the LORD has blessed his people, and this great amount is left over."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the LORD, and this was done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes and dedicated gifts. Conaniah, a Levite, was in charge of these things, and his brother Shimei was next in rank.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath and Benaiah were supervisors under Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the official in charge of the temple of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions made to the LORD and also the consecrated gifts.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shecaniah assisted him faithfully in the towns of the priests, distributing to their fellow priests according to their divisions, old and young alike.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">In addition, they distributed to the males three years old or more whose names were in the genealogical records-all who would enter the temple of the LORD to perform the daily duties of their various tasks, according to their responsibilities and their divisions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">And they distributed to the priests enrolled by their families in the genealogical records and likewise to the Levites twenty years old or more, according to their responsibilities and their divisions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">They included all the little ones, the wives, and the sons and daughters of the whole community listed in these genealogical records. For they were faithful in consecrating themselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farm lands around their towns or in any other towns, men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all who were recorded in the genealogies of the Levites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah, doing what was good and right and faithful before the LORD his God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">In everything that he undertook in the service of God's temple and in obedience to the law and the commands, he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly. And so he prospered.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="32">
<VERS vnumber="1">After all that Hezekiah had so faithfully done, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, thinking to conquer them for himself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to make war on Jerusalem,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">he consulted with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city, and they helped him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">A large force of men assembled, and they blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?" they said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the supporting terraces of the City of David. He also made large numbers of weapons and shields.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles." And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Later, when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were laying siege to Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who were there:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: On what are you basing your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When Hezekiah says, 'The LORD our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria,' he is misleading you, to let you die of hunger and thirst.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god's high places and altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, 'You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it'?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Who of all the gods of these nations that my fathers destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your god deliver you from my hand?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your god deliver you from my hand!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Sennacherib's officers spoke further against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The king also wrote letters insulting the LORD, the God of Israel, and saying this against him: "Just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand, so the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then they called out in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to terrify them and make them afraid in order to capture the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the world-the work of men's hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">And the LORD sent an angel, who annihilated all the fighting men and the leaders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he went into the temple of his god, some of his sons cut him down with the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all others. He took care of them on every side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the LORD and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah. From then on he was highly regarded by all the nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. He prayed to the LORD, who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">But Hezekiah's heart was proud and he did not respond to the kindness shown him; therefore the LORD's wrath was on him and on Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then Hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart, as did the people of Jerusalem; therefore the LORD's wrath did not come upon them during the days of Hezekiah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Hezekiah had very great riches and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuables.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">He also made buildings to store the harvest of grain, new wine and oil; and he made stalls for various kinds of cattle, and pens for the flocks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">He built villages and acquired great numbers of flocks and herds, for God had given him very great riches.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Gihon spring and channeled the water down to the west side of the City of David. He succeeded in everything he undertook.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">But when envoys were sent by the rulers of Babylon to ask him about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to test him and to know everything that was in his heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The other events of Hezekiah's reign and his acts of devotion are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Hezekiah rested with his fathers and was buried on the hill where the tombs of David's descendants are. All Judah and the people of Jerusalem honored him when he died. And Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="33">
<VERS vnumber="1">Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, following the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had demolished; he also erected altars to the Baals and made Asherah poles. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He built altars in the temple of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, "My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">In both courts of the temple of the LORD, he built altars to all the starry hosts.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He sacrificed his sons in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced sorcery, divination and witchcraft, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He took the carved image he had made and put it in God's temple, of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, "In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">I will not again make the feet of the Israelites leave the land I assigned to your forefathers, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them concerning all the laws, decrees and ordinances given through Moses."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So the LORD brought against them the army commanders of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh prisoner, put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">In his distress he sought the favor of the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And when he prayed to him, the LORD was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea; so he brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD is God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Afterward he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, west of the Gihon spring in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel; he also made it much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He got rid of the foreign gods and removed the image from the temple of the LORD, as well as all the altars he had built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem; and he threw them out of the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then he restored the altar of the LORD and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it, and told Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The people, however, continued to sacrifice at the high places, but only to the LORD their God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The other events of Manasseh's reign, including his prayer to his God and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, are written in the annals of the kings of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">His prayer and how God was moved by his entreaty, as well as all his sins and unfaithfulness, and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself-all are written in the records of the seers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in his palace. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done. Amon worshiped and offered sacrifices to all the idols Manasseh had made.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">But unlike his father Manasseh, he did not humble himself before the LORD; Amon increased his guilt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Amon's officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="34">
<VERS vnumber="1">Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his father David. In his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places, Asherah poles, carved idols and cast images.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Under his direction the altars of the Baals were torn down; he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them, and smashed the Asherah poles, the idols and the images. These he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and so he purged Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins around them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">he tore down the altars and the Asherah poles and crushed the idols to powder and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">In the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, to purify the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the ruler of the city, with Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the temple of the LORD his God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the temple of God, which the Levites who were the doorkeepers had collected from the people of Manasseh, Ephraim and the entire remnant of Israel and from all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then they entrusted it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the LORD's temple. These men paid the workers who repaired and restored the temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to purchase dressed stone, and timber for joists and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The men did the work faithfully. Over them to direct them were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites descended from Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, descended from Kohath. The Levites-all who were skilled in playing musical instruments-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">had charge of the laborers and supervised all the workers from job to job. Some of the Levites were secretaries, scribes and doorkeepers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">While they were bringing out the money that had been taken into the temple of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD that had been given through Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the LORD." He gave it to Shaphan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then Shaphan took the book to the king and reported to him: "Your officials are doing everything that has been committed to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They have paid out the money that was in the temple of the LORD and have entrusted it to the supervisors and workers."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his robes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">He gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king's attendant:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"Go and inquire of the LORD for me and for the remnant in Israel and Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the LORD's anger that is poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written in this book."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Hilkiah and those the king had sent with him went to speak to the prophetess Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">She said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">'This is what the LORD says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people-all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and provoked me to anger by all that their hands have made, my anger will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard what he spoke against this place and its people, and because you humbled yourself before me and tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Now I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place and on those who live here.'" So they took her answer back to the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">He went up to the temple of the LORD with the men of Judah, the people of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites-all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">The king stood by his pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the LORD -to follow the LORD and keep his commands, regulations and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, and to obey the words of the covenant written in this book.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Then he had everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin pledge themselves to it; the people of Jerusalem did this in accordance with the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Josiah removed all the detestable idols from all the territory belonging to the Israelites, and he had all who were present in Israel serve the LORD their God. As long as he lived, they did not fail to follow the LORD, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="35">
<VERS vnumber="1">Josiah celebrated the Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem, and the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them in the service of the LORD's temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He said to the Levites, who instructed all Israel and who had been consecrated to the LORD: "Put the sacred ark in the temple that Solomon son of David king of Israel built. It is not to be carried about on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Prepare yourselves by families in your divisions, according to the directions written by David king of Israel and by his son Solomon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Stand in the holy place with a group of Levites for each subdivision of the families of your fellow countrymen, the lay people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Slaughter the Passover lambs, consecrate yourselves and prepare the lambs for your fellow countrymen, doing what the LORD commanded through Moses."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Josiah provided for all the lay people who were there a total of thirty thousand sheep and goats for the Passover offerings, and also three thousand cattle-all from the king's own possessions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">His officials also contributed voluntarily to the people and the priests and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah and Jehiel, the administrators of God's temple, gave the priests twenty-six hundred Passover offerings and three hundred cattle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Also Conaniah along with Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, provided five thousand Passover offerings and five hundred head of cattle for the Levites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The service was arranged and the priests stood in their places with the Levites in their divisions as the king had ordered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The Passover lambs were slaughtered, and the priests sprinkled the blood handed to them, while the Levites skinned the animals.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the subdivisions of the families of the people to offer to the LORD, as is written in the Book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">They roasted the Passover animals over the fire as prescribed, and boiled the holy offerings in pots, caldrons and pans and served them quickly to all the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">After this, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat portions until nightfall. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the Aaronic priests.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The musicians, the descendants of Asaph, were in the places prescribed by David, Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun the king's seer. The gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their posts, because their fellow Levites made the preparations for them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So at that time the entire service of the LORD was carried out for the celebration of the Passover and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, as King Josiah had ordered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover at that time and observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The Passover had not been observed like this in Israel since the days of the prophet Samuel; and none of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated such a Passover as did Josiah, with the priests, the Levites and all Judah and Israel who were there with the people of Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah marched out to meet him in battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But Neco sent messengers to him, saying, "What quarrel is there between you and me, O king of Judah? It is not you I am attacking at this time, but the house with which I am at war. God has told me to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is with me, or he will destroy you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Neco had said at God's command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Archers shot King Josiah, and he told his officers, "Take me away; I am badly wounded."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">So they took him out of his chariot, put him in the other chariot he had and brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs of his fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah, and to this day all the men and women singers commemorate Josiah in the laments. These became a tradition in Israel and are written in the Laments.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The other events of Josiah's reign and his acts of devotion, according to what is written in the Law of the LORD -</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">all the events, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="36">
<VERS vnumber="1">And the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The king of Egypt dethroned him in Jerusalem and imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The king of Egypt made Eliakim, a brother of Jehoahaz, king over Judah and Jerusalem and changed Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Eliakim's brother Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD his God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked him and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Nebuchadnezzar also took to Babylon articles from the temple of the LORD and put them in his temple there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The other events of Jehoiakim's reign, the detestable things he did and all that was found against him, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son succeeded him as king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">In the spring, King Nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to Babylon, together with articles of value from the temple of the LORD, and he made Jehoiachin's uncle, Zedekiah, king over Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke the word of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him take an oath in God's name. He became stiff-necked and hardened his heart and would not turn to the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Furthermore, all the leaders of the priests and the people became more and more unfaithful, following all the detestable practices of the nations and defiling the temple of the LORD, which he had consecrated in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The LORD, the God of their fathers, sent word to them through his messengers again and again, because he had pity on his people and on his dwelling place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But they mocked God's messengers, despised his words and scoffed at his prophets until the wrath of the LORD was aroused against his people and there was no remedy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He brought up against them the king of the Babylonians, who killed their young men with the sword in the sanctuary, and spared neither young man nor young woman, old man or aged. God handed all of them over to Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He carried to Babylon all the articles from the temple of God, both large and small, and the treasures of the LORD's temple and the treasures of the king and his officials.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">They set fire to God's temple and broke down the wall of Jerusalem; they burned all the palaces and destroyed everything of value there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">He carried into exile to Babylon the remnant, who escaped from the sword, and they became servants to him and his sons until the kingdom of Persia came to power.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The land enjoyed its sabbath rests; all the time of its desolation it rested, until the seventy years were completed in fulfillment of the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah, the LORD moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: "'The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah.

<VERS vnumber="5">Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and Levites-everyone whose heart God had moved-prepared to go up and build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuable gifts, in addition to all the freewill offerings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Moreover, King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his god.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="5">After that, they presented the regular burnt offerings, the New Moon sacrifices and the sacrifices for all the appointed sacred feasts of the LORD, as well as those brought as freewill offerings to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, though the foundation of the LORD's temple had not yet been laid.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and gave food and drink and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, so that they would bring cedar logs by sea from Lebanon to Joppa, as authorized by Cyrus king of Persia.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">In the second month of the second year after their arrival at the house of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers (the priests and the Levites and all who had returned from the captivity to Jerusalem) began the work, appointing Levites twenty years of age and older to supervise the building of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Jeshua and his sons and brothers and Kadmiel and his sons (descendants of Hodaviah ) and the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers-all Levites-joined together in supervising those working on the house of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests in their vestments and with trumpets, and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with cymbals, took their places to praise the LORD, as prescribed by David king of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">With praise and thanksgiving they sang to the LORD: "He is good; his love to Israel endures forever." And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</VERS>

</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for the LORD, the God of Israel,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the families and said, "Let us help you build because, like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But Zerubbabel, Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel answered, "You have no part with us in building a temple to our God. We alone will build it for the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia, commanded us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to go on building.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">They hired counselors to work against them and frustrate their plans during the entire reign of Cyrus king of Persia and down to the reign of Darius king of Persia.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes, they lodged an accusation against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And in the days of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his associates wrote a letter to Artaxerxes. The letter was written in Aramaic script and in the Aramaic language.,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary, together with the rest of their associates-the judges and officials over the men from Tripolis, Persia, Erech and Babylon, the Elamites of Susa,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">and the other people whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">(This is a copy of the letter they sent him.) To King Artaxerxes, From your servants, the men of Trans-Euphrates:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The king should know that the Jews who came up to us from you have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are restoring the walls and repairing the foundations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Furthermore, the king should know that if this city is built and its walls are restored, no more taxes, tribute or duty will be paid, and the royal revenues will suffer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Now since we are under obligation to the palace and it is not proper for us to see the king dishonored, we are sending this message to inform the king,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">so that a search may be made in the archives of your predecessors. In these records you will find that this city is a rebellious city, troublesome to kings and provinces, a place of rebellion from ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">We inform the king that if this city is built and its walls are restored, you will be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The king sent this reply: To Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the secretary and the rest of their associates living in Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates: Greetings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The letter you sent us has been read and translated in my presence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">I issued an order and a search was made, and it was found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings and has been a place of rebellion and sedition.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over the whole of Trans-Euphrates, and taxes, tribute and duty were paid to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Now issue an order to these men to stop work, so that this city will not be rebuilt until I so order.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Be careful not to neglect this matter. Why let this threat grow, to the detriment of the royal interests?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">As soon as the copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary and their associates, they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem and compelled them by force to stop.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the prophet, a descendant of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak set to work to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them, helping them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">At that time Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates went to them and asked, "Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">They also asked, "What are the names of the men constructing this building?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But the eye of their God was watching over the elders of the Jews, and they were not stopped until a report could go to Darius and his written reply be received.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates, the officials of Trans-Euphrates, sent to King Darius.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The report they sent him read as follows: To King Darius: Cordial greetings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The king should know that we went to the district of Judah, to the temple of the great God. The people are building it with large stones and placing the timbers in the walls. The work is being carried on with diligence and is making rapid progress under their direction.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">We questioned the elders and asked them, "Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">We also asked them their names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">This is the answer they gave us: "We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, one that a great king of Israel built and finished.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But because our fathers angered the God of heaven, he handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean, king of Babylon, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He even removed from the temple of Babylon the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple in Babylon. "Then King Cyrus gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">and he told him, 'Take these articles and go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem. And rebuild the house of God on its site.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem. From that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Now if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">King Darius then issued an order, and they searched in the archives stored in the treasury at Babylon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">A scroll was found in the citadel of Ecbatana in the province of Media, and this was written on it: Memorandum:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">In the first year of King Cyrus, the king issued a decree concerning the temple of God in Jerusalem: Let the temple be rebuilt as a place to present sacrifices, and let its foundations be laid. It is to be ninety feet high and ninety feet wide,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">with three courses of large stones and one of timbers. The costs are to be paid by the royal treasury.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; they are to be deposited in the house of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Now then, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and you, their fellow officials of that province, stay away from there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Do not interfere with the work on this temple of God. Let the governor of the Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this house of God on its site.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Moreover, I hereby decree what you are to do for these elders of the Jews in the construction of this house of God: The expenses of these men are to be fully paid out of the royal treasury, from the revenues of Trans-Euphrates, so that the work will not stop.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Whatever is needed-young bulls, rams, male lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem-must be given them daily without fail,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">so that they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the God of heaven and pray for the well-being of the king and his sons.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Furthermore, I decree that if anyone changes this edict, a beam is to be pulled from his house and he is to be lifted up and impaled on it. And for this crime his house is to be made a pile of rubble.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">May God, who has caused his Name to dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in Jerusalem. I Darius have decreed it. Let it be carried out with diligence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then, because of the decree King Darius had sent, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates carried it out with diligence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So the elders of the Jews continued to build and prosper under the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo. They finished building the temple according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then the people of Israel-the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles-celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">For the dedication of this house of God they offered a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred male lambs and, as a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, one for each of the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And they installed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their groups for the service of God at Jerusalem, according to what is written in the Book of Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">On the fourteenth day of the first month, the exiles celebrated the Passover.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The priests and Levites had purified themselves and were all ceremonially clean. The Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their brothers the priests and for themselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So the Israelites who had returned from the exile ate it, together with all who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of their Gentile neighbors in order to seek the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">For seven days they celebrated with joy the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because the LORD had filled them with joy by changing the attitude of the king of Assyria, so that he assisted them in the work on the house of God, the God of Israel.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">After these things, during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="5">the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">this Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a teacher well versed in the Law of Moses, which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given. The king had granted him everything he asked, for the hand of the LORD his God was on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Some of the Israelites, including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers and temple servants, also came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He had begun his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, for the gracious hand of his God was on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the LORD, and to teaching its decrees and laws in Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">This is a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest and teacher, a man learned in matters concerning the commands and decrees of the LORD for Israel:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Artaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the priest, a teacher of the Law of the God of heaven: Greetings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Now I decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom, including priests and Levites, who wish to go to Jerusalem with you, may go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">You are sent by the king and his seven advisers to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God, which is in your hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Moreover, you are to take with you the silver and gold that the king and his advisers have freely given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">together with all the silver and gold you may obtain from the province of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings of the people and priests for the temple of their God in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">With this money be sure to buy bulls, rams and male lambs, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and sacrifice them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">You and your brother Jews may then do whatever seems best with the rest of the silver and gold, in accordance with the will of your God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles entrusted to you for worship in the temple of your God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And anything else needed for the temple of your God that you may have occasion to supply, you may provide from the royal treasury.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Now I, King Artaxerxes, order all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates to provide with diligence whatever Ezra the priest, a teacher of the Law of the God of heaven, may ask of you-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">up to a hundred talents of silver, a hundred cors of wheat, a hundred baths of wine, a hundred baths of olive oil, and salt without limit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Whatever the God of heaven has prescribed, let it be done with diligence for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and of his sons?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute or duty on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants or other workers at this house of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">And you, Ezra, in accordance with the wisdom of your God, which you possess, appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of Trans-Euphrates-all who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach any who do not know them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Whoever does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king must surely be punished by death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Praise be to the LORD, the God of our fathers, who has put it into the king's heart to bring honor to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem in this way</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">and who has extended his good favor to me before the king and his advisers and all the king's powerful officials. Because the hand of the LORD my God was on me, I took courage and gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">These are the family heads and those registered with them who came up with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes:</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">of the descendants of Shecaniah; of the descendants of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were registered 150 men;</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="14">of the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai and Zaccur, and with them 70 men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">and I sent them to Iddo, the leader in Casiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his kinsmen, the temple servants in Casiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah's sons and brothers, 18 men;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews, 20 men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">They also brought 220 of the temple servants-a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, "The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, together with Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">I weighed out to them 650 talents of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents, 100 talents of gold,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">20 bowls of gold valued at 1,000 darics, and two fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">I said to them, "You as well as these articles are consecrated to the LORD. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the LORD in Jerusalem before the leading priests and the Levites and the family heads of Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested three days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight was recorded at that time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs and, as a sin offering, twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">They also delivered the king's orders to the royal satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave assistance to the people and to the house of God.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, "The people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the LORD my God</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">and prayed: "O my God, I am too ashamed and disgraced to lift up my face to you, my God, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">From the days of our forefathers until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"But now, for a brief moment, the LORD our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place in his sanctuary, and so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Though we are slaves, our God has not deserted us in our bondage. He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia: He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"But now, O our God, what can we say after this? For we have disregarded the commands</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: 'The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins have deserved and have given us a remnant like this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Shall we again break your commands and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">O LORD, God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites-men, women and children-gathered around him. They too wept bitterly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, "We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel's guilt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Now make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: "You are right! We must do as you say.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Among the descendants of the priests, the following had married foreign women: From the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">(They all gave their hands in pledge to put away their wives, and for their guilt they each presented a ram from the flock as a guilt offering.)</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah: In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">They said to me, "Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then I said: "O LORD, God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and obey his commands,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father's house, have committed against you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, 'If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man." I was cupbearer to the king.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought for him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">so the king asked me, "Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart." I was very much afraid,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">but I said to the king, "May the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my fathers are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The king said to me, "What is it you want?" Then I prayed to the God of heaven,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">and I answered the king, "If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my fathers are buried so that I can rebuild it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, "How long will your journey take, and when will you get back?" It pleased the king to send me; so I set a time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">I also said to him, "If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the king's forest, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?" And because the gracious hand of my God was upon me, the king granted my requests.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king's letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">I set out during the night with a few men. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal Well and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">I also told them about the gracious hand of my God upon me and what the king had said to me. They replied, "Let us start rebuilding." So they began this good work.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. "What is this you are doing?" they asked. "Are you rebelling against the king?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">I answered them by saying, "The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it."</VERS>

</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and was greatly incensed. He ridiculed the Jews,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria, he said, "What are those feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble-burned as they are?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his side, said, "What they are building-if even a fox climbed up on it, he would break down their wall of stones!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Hear us, O our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the men of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem's walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed, they were very angry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, "The strength of the laborers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Also our enemies said, "Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, "Wherever you turn, they will attack us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears and bows.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "Don't be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his own work.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows and armor. The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from the first light of dawn till the stars came out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">At that time I also said to the people, "Have every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night, so they can serve us as guards by night and workmen by day."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Neither I nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our clothes; each had his weapon, even when he went for water.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their Jewish brothers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Some were saying, "We and our sons and daughters are numerous; in order for us to eat and stay alive, we must get grain."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Others were saying, "We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Still others were saying, "We have had to borrow money to pay the king's tax on our fields and vineyards.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our countrymen and though our sons are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them, "You are exacting usury from your own countrymen!" So I called together a large meeting to deal with them</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">and said: "As far as possible, we have bought back our Jewish brothers who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your brothers, only for them to be sold back to us!" They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So I continued, "What you are doing is not right. Shouldn't you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let the exacting of usury stop!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and houses, and also the usury you are charging them-the hundredth part of the money, grain, new wine and oil."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"We will give it back," they said. "And we will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say." Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, "In this way may God shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep this promise. So may such a man be shaken out and emptied!" At this the whole assembly said, "Amen," and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year-twelve years-neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But the earlier governors-those preceding me-placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God I did not act like that.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we did not acquire any land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Remember me with favor, O my God, for all I have done for these people.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it-though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: "Come, let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono." But they were scheming to harm me;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">so I sent messengers to them with this reply: "I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">in which was written: "It is reported among the nations-and Geshem says it is true-that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: 'There is a king in Judah!' Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us confer together."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">I sent him this reply: "Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, "Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed." But I prayed, "Now strengthen my hands."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, "Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you-by night they are coming to kill you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But I said, "Should a man like me run away? Or should one like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel, because he was a man of integrity and feared God more than most men do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I said to them, "The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut the doors and bar them. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some near their own houses."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Now the city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the common people for registration by families. I found the genealogical record of those who had been the first to return. This is what I found written there:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="73">The priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers and the temple servants, along with certain of the people and the rest of the Israelites, settled in their own towns. When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns,</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">all the people assembled as one man in the square before the Water Gate. They told Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded for Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So on the first day of the seventh month Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, which was made up of men and women and all who were able to understand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate in the presence of the men, women and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform built for the occasion. Beside him on his right stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah and Maaseiah; and on his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Ezra opened the book. All the people could see him because he was standing above them; and as he opened it, the people all stood up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Ezra praised the LORD, the great God; and all the people lifted their hands and responded, "Amen! Amen!" Then they bowed down and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The Levites-Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan and Pelaiah-instructed the people in the Law while the people were standing there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">They read from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear and giving the meaning so that the people could understand what was being read.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, "This day is sacred to the LORD your God. Do not mourn or weep." For all the people had been weeping as they listened to the words of the Law.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Nehemiah said, "Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is sacred to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The Levites calmed all the people, saying, "Be still, for this is a sacred day. Do not grieve."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then all the people went away to eat and drink, to send portions of food and to celebrate with great joy, because they now understood the words that had been made known to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">On the second day of the month, the heads of all the families, along with the priests and the Levites, gathered around Ezra the scribe to give attention to the words of the Law.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They found written in the Law, which the LORD had commanded through Moses, that the Israelites were to live in booths during the feast of the seventh month</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">and that they should proclaim this word and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem: "Go out into the hill country and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, and from myrtles, palms and shade trees, to make booths"-as it is written.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So the people went out and brought back branches and built themselves booths on their own roofs, in their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God and in the square by the Water Gate and the one by the Gate of Ephraim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The whole company that had returned from exile built booths and lived in them. From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated it like this. And their joy was very great.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Day after day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrated the feast for seven days, and on the eighth day, in accordance with the regulation, there was an assembly.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together, fasting and wearing sackcloth and having dust on their heads.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Those of Israelite descent had separated themselves from all foreigners. They stood in their places and confessed their sins and the wickedness of their fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">They stood where they were and read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God for a quarter of the day, and spent another quarter in confession and in worshiping the LORD their God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Standing on the stairs were the Levites-Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Kenani-who called with loud voices to the LORD their God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">And the Levites-Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah-said: "Stand up and praise the LORD your God, who is from everlasting to everlasting. Blessed be your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">You alone are the LORD. You made the heavens, even the highest heavens, and all their starry host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to everything, and the multitudes of heaven worship you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"You are the LORD God, who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and named him Abraham.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">You found his heart faithful to you, and you made a covenant with him to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites and Girgashites. You have kept your promise because you are righteous.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"You saw the suffering of our forefathers in Egypt; you heard their cry at the Red Sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">You sent miraculous signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his officials and all the people of his land, for you knew how arrogantly the Egyptians treated them. You made a name for yourself, which remains to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">You divided the sea before them, so that they passed through it on dry ground, but you hurled their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">By day you led them with a pillar of cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the way they were to take.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"You came down on Mount Sinai; you spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and laws that are just and right, and decrees and commands that are good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">You made known to them your holy Sabbath and gave them commands, decrees and laws through your servant Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">In their hunger you gave them bread from heaven and in their thirst you brought them water from the rock; you told them to go in and take possession of the land you had sworn with uplifted hand to give them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"But they, our forefathers, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and did not obey your commands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,' or when they committed awful blasphemies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the desert. By day the pillar of cloud did not cease to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">For forty years you sustained them in the desert; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"You gave them kingdoms and nations, allotting to them even the remotest frontiers. They took over the country of Sihon king of Heshbon and the country of Og king of Bashan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">You made their sons as numerous as the stars in the sky, and you brought them into the land that you told their fathers to enter and possess.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Their sons went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites, who lived in the land; you handed the Canaanites over to them, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with them as they pleased.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">They captured fortified cities and fertile land; they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the full and were well-nourished; they reveled in your great goodness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">"But they were disobedient and rebelled against you; they put your law behind their backs. They killed your prophets, who had admonished them in order to turn them back to you; they committed awful blasphemies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">So you handed them over to their enemies, who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed they cried out to you. From heaven you heard them, and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers, who rescued them from the hand of their enemies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">"But as soon as they were at rest, they again did what was evil in your sight. Then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them. And when they cried out to you again, you heard from heaven, and in your compassion you delivered them time after time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">"You warned them to return to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances, by which a man will live if he obeys them. Stubbornly they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">For many years you were patient with them. By your Spirit you admonished them through your prophets. Yet they paid no attention, so you handed them over to the neighboring peoples.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">But in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">"Now therefore, O our God, the great, mighty and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love, do not let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyes-the hardship that has come upon us, upon our kings and leaders, upon our priests and prophets, upon our fathers and all your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">In all that has happened to us, you have been just; you have acted faithfully, while we did wrong.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Our kings, our leaders, our priests and our fathers did not follow your law; they did not pay attention to your commands or the warnings you gave them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Even while they were in their kingdom, enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them, they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">"But see, we are slaves today, slaves in the land you gave our forefathers so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Because of our sins, its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us. They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="25">Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="27">At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from where they lived and were brought to Jerusalem to celebrate joyfully the dedication with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, harps and lyres.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">The singers also were brought together from the region around Jerusalem-from the villages of the Netophathites,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">from Beth Gilgal, and from the area of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">When the priests and Levites had purified themselves ceremonially, they purified the people, the gates and the wall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">I had the leaders of Judah go up on top of the wall. I also assigned two large choirs to give thanks. One was to proceed on top of the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="37">At the Fountain Gate they continued directly up the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">The second choir proceeded in the opposite direction. I followed them on top of the wall, together with half the people-past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. At the Gate of the Guard they stopped.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">The two choirs that gave thanks then took their places in the house of God; so did I, together with half the officials,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="42">and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam and Ezer. The choirs sang under the direction of Jezrahiah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">And on that day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard far away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">At that time men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits and tithes. From the fields around the towns they were to bring into the storerooms the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did also the singers and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David and his son Solomon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers. They also set aside the portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
<VERS vnumber="1">On that day the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people and there it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be admitted into the assembly of God,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">because they had not met the Israelites with food and water but had hired Balaam to call a curse down on them. (Our God, however, turned the curse into a blessing.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When the people heard this law, they excluded from Israel all who were of foreign descent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Before this, Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God. He was closely associated with Tobiah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain offerings and incense and temple articles, and also the tithes of grain, new wine and oil prescribed for the Levites, singers and gatekeepers, as well as the contributions for the priests.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But while all this was going on, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Some time later I asked his permission</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">and came back to Jerusalem. Here I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done in providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the house of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">I was greatly displeased and threw all Tobiah's household goods out of the room.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I gave orders to purify the rooms, and then I put back into them the equipment of the house of God, with the grain offerings and the incense.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">I also learned that the portions assigned to the Levites had not been given to them, and that all the Levites and singers responsible for the service had gone back to their own fields.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So I rebuked the officials and asked them, "Why is the house of God neglected?" Then I called them together and stationed them at their posts.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">All Judah brought the tithes of grain, new wine and oil into the storerooms.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I put Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and a Levite named Pedaiah in charge of the storerooms and made Hanan son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah, their assistant, because these men were considered trustworthy. They were made responsible for distributing the supplies to their brothers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Remember me for this, O my God, and do not blot out what I have so faithfully done for the house of my God and its services.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">In those days I saw men in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys, together with wine, grapes, figs and all other kinds of loads. And they were bringing all this into Jerusalem on the Sabbath. Therefore I warned them against selling food on that day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Men from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath to the people of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this wicked thing you are doing-desecrating the Sabbath day?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Didn't your forefathers do the same things, so that our God brought all this calamity upon us and upon this city? Now you are stirring up more wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until the Sabbath was over. I stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in on the Sabbath day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But I warned them and said, "Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do this again, I will lay hands on you." From that time on they no longer came on the Sabbath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and go and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember me for this also, O my God, and show mercy to me according to your great love.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Moreover, in those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples, and did not know how to speak the language of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">I rebuked them and called curses down on them. I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath in God's name and said: "You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Was it not because of marriages like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by foreign women.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Must we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and are being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. And I drove him away from me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Remember them, O my God, because they defiled the priestly office and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">So I purified the priests and the Levites of everything foreign, and assigned them duties, each to his own task.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">I also made provision for contributions of wood at designated times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me with favor, O my God.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="7">Wine was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king's liberality.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">By the king's command each guest was allowed to drink in his own way, for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">On the seventh day, when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him-Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carcas-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">to bring before him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles, for she was lovely to look at.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But when the attendants delivered the king's command, Queen Vashti refused to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">and were closest to the king-Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"According to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?" he asked. "She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then Memucan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, "Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">For the queen's conduct will become known to all the women, and so they will despise their husbands and say, 'King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she would not come.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen's conduct will respond to all the king's nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Therefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then when the king's edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm, all the women will respect their husbands, from the least to the greatest."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice, so the king did as Memucan proposed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, proclaiming in each people's tongue that every man should be ruler over his own household.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">Later when the anger of King Xerxes had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what he had decreed about her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then the king's personal attendants proposed, "Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful girls into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let beauty treatments be given to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti." This advice appealed to the king, and he followed it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Now there was in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with Jehoiachin king of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This girl, who was also known as Esther, was lovely in form and features, and Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When the king's order and edict had been proclaimed, many girls were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king's palace and entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of the harem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The girl pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven maids selected from the king's palace and moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Every day he walked back and forth near the courtyard of the harem to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Before a girl's turn came to go in to King Xerxes, she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women, six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And this is how she would go to the king: Anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When the turn came for Esther (the girl Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested. And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And the king gave a great banquet, Esther's banquet, for all his nobles and officials. He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">But Esther had kept secret her family background and nationality just as Mordecai had told her to do, for she continued to follow Mordecai's instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">And when the report was investigated and found to be true, the two officials were hanged on a gallows. All this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">All the royal officials at the king's gate knelt down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then the royal officials at the king's gate asked Mordecai, "Why do you disobey the king's command?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai's behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Yet having learned who Mordecai's people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai's people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, they cast the pur (that is, the lot) in the presence of Haman to select a day and month. And the lot fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then Haman said to King Xerxes, "There is a certain people dispersed and scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom whose customs are different from those of all other people and who do not obey the king's laws; it is not in the king's best interest to tolerate them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will put ten thousand talents of silver into the royal treasury for the men who carry out this business."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Keep the money," the king said to Haman, "and do with the people as you please."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were summoned. They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all Haman's orders to the king's satraps, the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with the order to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews-young and old, women and little children-on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for that day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Spurred on by the king's command, the couriers went out, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">But he went only as far as the king's gate, because no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">In every province to which the edict and order of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When Esther's maids and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai, she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs assigned to attend her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and explain it to her, and he told him to urge her to go into the king's presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Hathach went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"All the king's officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law: that he be put to death. The only exception to this is for the king to extend the gold scepter to him and spare his life. But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to the king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When Esther's words were reported to Mordecai,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">he sent back this answer: "Do not think that because you are in the king's house you alone of all the Jews will escape.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther's instructions.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace, in front of the king's hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall, facing the entrance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then the king asked, "What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be given you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"If it pleases the king," replied Esther, "let the king, together with Haman, come today to a banquet I have prepared for him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Bring Haman at once," the king said, "so that we may do what Esther asks." So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">As they were drinking wine, the king again asked Esther, "Now what is your petition? It will be given you. And what is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Esther replied, "My petition and my request is this:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">If the king regards me with favor and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them. Then I will answer the king's question."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Haman went out that day happy and in high spirits. But when he saw Mordecai at the king's gate and observed that he neither rose nor showed fear in his presence, he was filled with rage against Mordecai.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home. Calling together his friends and Zeresh, his wife,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"And that's not all," Haman added. "I'm the only person Queen Esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave. And she has invited me along with the king tomorrow.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king's gate."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">His wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, "Have a gallows built, seventy-five feet high, and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go with the king to the dinner and be happy." This suggestion delighted Haman, and he had the gallows built.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">That night the king could not sleep; so he ordered the book of the chronicles, the record of his reign, to be brought in and read to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">It was found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway, who had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?" the king asked. "Nothing has been done for him," his attendants answered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The king said, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows he had erected for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">His attendants answered, "Haman is standing in the court.Bring him in," the king ordered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When Haman entered, the king asked him, "What should be done for the man the king delights to honor?" Now Haman thought to himself, "Who is there that the king would rather honor than me?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So he answered the king, "For the man the king delights to honor,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">have them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden, one with a royal crest placed on its head.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king's most noble princes. Let them robe the man the king delights to honor, and lead him on the horse through the city streets, proclaiming before him, 'This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Go at once," the king commanded Haman. "Get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate. Do not neglect anything you have recommended."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So Haman got the robe and the horse. He robed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, "This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Afterward Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">and told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, "Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has started, is of Jewish origin, you cannot stand against him-you will surely come to ruin!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">While they were still talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and hurried Haman away to the banquet Esther had prepared.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">and as they were drinking wine on that second day, the king again asked, "Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then Queen Esther answered, "If I have found favor with you, O king, and if it pleases your majesty, grant me my life-this is my petition. And spare my people-this is my request.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">For I and my people have been sold for destruction and slaughter and annihilation. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because no such distress would justify disturbing the king. "</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, "Who is he? Where is the man who has dared to do such a thing?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Esther said, "The adversary and enemy is this vile Haman." Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, "Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?" As soon as the word left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, "A gallows seventy-five feet high stands by Haman's house. He had it made for Mordecai, who spoke up to help the king." The king said, "Hang him on it!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's fury subsided.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came into the presence of the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The king took off his signet ring, which he had reclaimed from Haman, and presented it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed him over Haman's estate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Esther again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite, which he had devised against the Jews.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the king extended the gold scepter to Esther and she arose and stood before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"If it pleases the king," she said, "and if he regards me with favor and thinks it the right thing to do, and if he is pleased with me, let an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king's provinces.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">For how can I bear to see disaster fall on my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my family?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, "Because Haman attacked the Jews, I have given his estate to Esther, and they have hanged him on the gallows.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Now write another decree in the king's name in behalf of the Jews as seems best to you, and seal it with the king's signet ring-for no document written in the king's name and sealed with his ring can be revoked."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">At once the royal secretaries were summoned-on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai's orders to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors and nobles of the 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush. These orders were written in the script of each province and the language of each people and also to the Jews in their own script and language.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Mordecai wrote in the name of King Xerxes, sealed the dispatches with the king's signet ring, and sent them by mounted couriers, who rode fast horses especially bred for the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The king's edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves; to destroy, kill and annihilate any armed force of any nationality or province that might attack them and their women and children; and to plunder the property of their enemies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The couriers, riding the royal horses, raced out, spurred on by the king's command. And the edict was also issued in the citadel of Susa.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Mordecai left the king's presence wearing royal garments of blue and white, a large crown of gold and a purple robe of fine linen. And the city of Susa held a joyous celebration.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">For the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">In every province and in every city, wherever the edict of the king went, there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And many people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews had seized them.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, the edict commanded by the king was to be carried out. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand over those who hated them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The Jews assembled in their cities in all the provinces of King Xerxes to attack those seeking their destruction. No one could stand against them, because the people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">And all the nobles of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and the king's administrators helped the Jews, because fear of Mordecai had seized them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Mordecai was prominent in the palace; his reputation spread throughout the provinces, and he became more and more powerful.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and they did what they pleased to those who hated them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not lay their hands on the plunder.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The number of those slain in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king that same day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The king said to Queen Esther, "The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman in the citadel of Susa. What have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? Now what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? It will also be granted."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"If it pleases the king," Esther answered, "give the Jews in Susa permission to carry out this day's edict tomorrow also, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on gallows."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So the king commanded that this be done. An edict was issued in Susa, and they hanged the ten sons of Haman.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The Jews in Susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they put to death in Susa three hundred men, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Meanwhile, the remainder of the Jews who were in the king's provinces also assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of them but did not lay their hands on the plunder.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">This happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The Jews in Susa, however, had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth, and then on the fifteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">That is why rural Jews-those living in villages-observe the fourteenth of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting, a day for giving presents to each other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Xerxes, near and far,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">to have them celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">as the time when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration. He wrote them to observe the days as days of feasting and joy and giving presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So the Jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun, doing what Mordecai had written to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the pur (that is, the lot) for their ruin and destruction.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">But when the plot came to the king's attention, he issued written orders that the evil scheme Haman had devised against the Jews should come back onto his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">(Therefore these days were called Purim, from the word pur.) Because of everything written in this letter and because of what they had seen and what had happened to them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">the Jews took it upon themselves to establish the custom that they and their descendants and all who join them should without fail observe these two days every year, in the way prescribed and at the time appointed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">These days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every family, and in every province and in every city. And these days of Purim should never cease to be celebrated by the Jews, nor should the memory of them die out among their descendants.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">So Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Xerxes-words of goodwill and assurance-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">to establish these days of Purim at their designated times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them, and as they had established for themselves and their descendants in regard to their times of fasting and lamentation.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Esther's decree confirmed these regulations about Purim, and it was written down in the records.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the empire, to its distant shores.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And all his acts of power and might, together with a full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king had raised him, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Media and Persia?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Mordecai the Jew was second in rank to King Xerxes, preeminent among the Jews, and held in high esteem by his many fellow Jews, because he worked for the good of his people and spoke up for the welfare of all the Jews.</VERS>

<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="18" bname="Job" bsname="Job">
<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He had seven sons and three daughters,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">On another day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He replied, "You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He said:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, 'A boy is born!'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">That day-may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">May darkness and deep shadow claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">That night-may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">May those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">At the breath of God they are destroyed; at the blast of his anger they perish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">'Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?'</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">"Call if you will, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">His children are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"But if it were I, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He bestows rain on the earth; he sends water upon the countryside.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Blessed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">From six calamities he will rescue you; in seven no harm will befall you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">In famine he will ransom you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">You will come to the grave in full vigor, like sheaves gathered in season.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">"We have examined this, and it is true. So hear it and apply it to yourself."</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Job replied:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas- no wonder my words have been impetuous.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut me off!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then I would still have this consolation- my joy in unrelenting pain- that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends, even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="18">Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go up into the wasteland and perish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Have I ever said, 'Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="24">"Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat the words of a despairing man as wind?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="8">The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">"But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Answer me then, if you can; prepare yourself and confront me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">I am just like you before God; I too have been taken from clay.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy upon you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"But you have said in my hearing- I heard the very words-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">'I am pure and without sin; I am clean and free from guilt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Why do you complain to him that he answers none of man's words?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">For God does speak-now one way, now another- though man may not perceive it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">to preserve his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his bones, once hidden, now stick out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">His soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the messengers of death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">to be gracious to him and say, 'Spare him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom for him'-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">then his flesh is renewed like a child's; it is restored as in the days of his youth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He prays to God and finds favor with him, he sees God's face and shouts for joy; he is restored by God to his righteous state.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then he comes to men and says, 'I sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and I will live to enjoy the light.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">"God does all these things to a man- twice, even three times-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">to turn back his soul from the pit, that the light of life may shine on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">"Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want you to be cleared.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="34">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Elihu said:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Job says, 'I am innocent, but God denies me justice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with wicked men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">For he says, 'It profits a man nothing when he tries to please God.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He repays a man for what he has done; he brings upon him what his conduct deserves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit and breath,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">all mankind would perish together and man would return to the dust.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Can he who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Is he not the One who says to kings, 'You are worthless,' and to nobles, 'You are wicked,'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"His eyes are on the ways of men; he sees their every step.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">There is no dark place, no deep shadow, where evildoers can hide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">God has no need to examine men further, that they should come before him for judgment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over man and nation alike,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">to keep a godless man from ruling, from laying snares for the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">"Suppose a man says to God, 'I am guilty but will offend no more.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">"Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">'Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="35">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Elihu said:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Do you think this is just? You say, 'I will be cleared by God. '</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Yet you ask him, 'What profit is it to me, and what do I gain by not sinning?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only the sons of men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Men cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">who teaches more to us than to the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="36">
<VERS vnumber="1">Elihu continued:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God's behalf.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Be assured that my words are not false; one perfect in knowledge is with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"God is mighty, but does not despise men; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But if men are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">he tells them what they have done- that they have sinned arrogantly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have taken hold of you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Be careful that no one entices you by riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Do not long for the night, to drag people away from their homes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Who has prescribed his ways for him, or said to him, 'You have done wrong'?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Remember to extol his work, which men have praised in song.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">All mankind has seen it; men gaze on it from afar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">How great is God-beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">"He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">See how he scatters his lightning about him, bathing the depths of the sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">This is the way he governs the nations and provides food in abundance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="37">
<VERS vnumber="1">"At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">After that comes the sound of his roar; he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">God's voice thunders in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth,' and to the rain shower, 'Be a mighty downpour.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So that all men he has made may know his work, he stops every man from his labor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The animals take cover; they remain in their dens.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He brings the clouds to punish men, or to water his earth and show his love.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God's wonders.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who is perfect in knowledge?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Should he be told that I want to speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Therefore, men revere him, for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart? "</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="38">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm. He said:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Who is this that darkens my counsel with words without knowledge?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">when I said, 'This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt'?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"What is the way to the abode of light? And where does darkness reside?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Surely you know, for you were already born! You have lived so many years!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the thunderstorm,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">to water a land where no man lives, a desert with no one in it,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">"Can you bind the beautiful Pleiades? Can you loose the cords of Orion?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its cubs?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up God's dominion over the earth?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">"Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Do you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, 'Here we are'?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Who endowed the heart with wisdom or gave understanding to the mind?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">when the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">"Do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food?</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="39">
<VERS vnumber="1">"Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Do you count the months till they bear? Do you know the time they give birth?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">They crouch down and bring forth their young; their labor pains are ended.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; they leave and do not return.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Who let the wild donkey go free? Who untied his ropes?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">I gave him the wasteland as his home, the salt flats as his habitat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He laughs at the commotion in the town; he does not hear a driver's shout.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He ranges the hills for his pasture and searches for any green thing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he till the valleys behind you?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Will you rely on him for his great strength? Will you leave your heavy work to him?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but they cannot compare with the pinions and feathers of the stork.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">She lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">unmindful that a foot may crush them, that some wild animal may trample them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; she cares not that her labor was in vain,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">for God did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Do you give the horse his strength or clothe his neck with a flowing mane?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He paws fiercely, rejoicing in his strength, and charges into the fray.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">He laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; he does not shy away from the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The quiver rattles against his side, along with the flashing spear and lance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">In frenzied excitement he eats up the ground; he cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">At the blast of the trumpet he snorts, 'Aha!' He catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of commanders and the battle cry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">"Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread his wings toward the south?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Does the eagle soar at your command and build his nest on high?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">He dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; a rocky crag is his stronghold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">From there he seeks out his food; his eyes detect it from afar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">His young ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there is he."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="40">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD said to Job:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then Job answered the LORD:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"I am unworthy-how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I spoke once, but I have no answer- twice, but I will say no more."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at every proud man and bring him low,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">look at every proud man and humble him, crush the wicked where they stand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"Look at the behemoth, which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">What strength he has in his loins, what power in the muscles of his belly!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He ranks first among the works of God, yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The hills bring him their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Under the lotus plants he lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The lotuses conceal him in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">When the river rages, he is not alarmed; he is secure, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Can anyone capture him by the eyes, or trap him and pierce his nose?</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="41">
<VERS vnumber="1">"Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">No one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Arrows do not make him flee; slingstones are like chaff to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">A club seems to him but a piece of straw; he laughs at the rattling of the lance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">He makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Nothing on earth is his equal- a creature without fear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud."</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="4">"You said, 'Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="7">After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought upon him, and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And he also had seven sons and three daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">And so he died, old and full of years.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="9">He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="13">As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him;</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">Praise the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters. He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He makes winds his messengers, flames of fire his servants.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But at your rebuke the waters fled, at the sound of your thunder they took to flight;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">they flowed over the mountains, they went down into the valleys, to the place you assigned for them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">You set a boundary they cannot cross; never again will they cover the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He makes springs pour water into the ravines; it flows between the mountains.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">They give water to all the beasts of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The birds of the air nest by the waters; they sing among the branches.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of his work.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for man to cultivate- bringing forth food from the earth:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil to make his face shine, and bread that sustains his heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The trees of the LORD are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">There the birds make their nests; the stork has its home in the pine trees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags are a refuge for the coneys.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The moon marks off the seasons, and the sun knows when to go down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">You bring darkness, it becomes night, and all the beasts of the forest prowl.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The sun rises, and they steal away; they return and lie down in their dens.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then man goes out to his work, to his labor until evening.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">How many are your works, O LORD! In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number- living things both large and small.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">There the ships go to and fro, and the leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">These all look to you to give them their food at the proper time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">he who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="7">He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He remembers his covenant forever, the word he commanded, for a thousand generations,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="12">When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">and he sent a man before them- Joseph, sold as a slave.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the LORD proved him true.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="23">Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="30">Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land;</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="36">Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">They asked, and he brought them quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">He opened the rock, and water gushed out; like a river it flowed in the desert.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="6">We have sinned, even as our fathers did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When our fathers were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Yet he saved them for his name's sake, to make his mighty power known.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="13">But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wasteland they put God to the test.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease upon them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="18">Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">They exchanged their Glory for an image of a bull, which eats grass.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">There on the poplars we hung our harps,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">for there our captors asked us for songs, our tormentors demanded songs of joy; they said, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!"</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="5">If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill.</VERS>

</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="139">

<VERS vnumber="14">I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">How precious to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand. When I awake, I am still with you.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="7">O Sovereign LORD, my strong deliverer, who shields my head in the day of battle-</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="5">Let a righteous man strike me-it is a kindness; let him rebuke me-it is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it. Yet my prayer is ever against the deeds of evildoers;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They will say, "As one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave. "</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But my eyes are fixed on you, O Sovereign LORD; in you I take refuge-do not give me over to death.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">The enemy pursues me, he crushes me to the ground; he makes me dwell in darkness like those long dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So my spirit grows faint within me; my heart within me is dismayed.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="6">I spread out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Answer me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me or I will be like those who go down to the pit.</VERS>
