    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">AND IT came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head; and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and prostrated himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And David said unto him: 'From whence comest thou?' And he said unto him: 'Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And David said unto him: 'How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.' And he answered: 'The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David said unto the young man that told him: 'How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the young man that told him said: 'As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen pressed hard upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered: Here am I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said unto me: Who art thou? And I answered him: I am an Amalekite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said unto me: Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me, for the agony hath taken hold of me; because my life is just yet in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they wailed, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And David said unto the young man that told him: 'Whence art thou?' And he answered: 'I am the son of an Amalekite stranger.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David said unto him: 'How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And David called one of the young men, and said: 'Go near, and fall upon him.' And he smote him that he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And David said unto him: 'Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying: I have slain the LORD'S anointed.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and said--To teach the sons of Judah the bow. Behold, it is written in the book of Jashar:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Thy beauty, O Israel, upon thy high places is slain! How are the mighty fallen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of choice fruits; for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Saul and Jonathan, the lovely and the pleasant in their lives, even in their death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan upon thy high places is slain!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant hast thou been unto me; wonderful was thy love to me, passing the love of women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the LORD, saying: 'Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?' And the LORD said unto him: 'Go up.' And David said: 'Whither shall I go up?' And He said: 'Unto Hebron.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the men of Judah came, and they there anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying: 'The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them: 'Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shown this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now the LORD show kindness and truth unto you; and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Ish-bosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out; and they met together by the pool of Gibeon, and sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Abner said to Joab: 'Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us.' And Joab said: 'Let them arise.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then they arose and passed over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together; wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim,      which is in Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the battle was very sore that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel; and Asahel was as light of foot as one of the roes that are in the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Abner looked behind him, and said: 'Is it thou, Asahel?' And he answered: 'It is I.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Abner said to him: 'Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour.' But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Abner said again to Asahel: 'Turn thee aside from following me; wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Howbeit he refused to turn aside; wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the groin, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place; and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner; and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Abner called to Joab, and said: 'Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Joab said: 'As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then only after the morning the people had gone away, every one from following his brother.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Joab blew the horn, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Joab returned from following Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, even of Abner's men--three hundred and threescore men died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And unto David were sons born in Hebron; and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner showed himself strong in the house of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and  Ish-bosheth  said to Abner: 'Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said: 'Am I a dog's head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as the LORD hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Abner sent messengers to David straightway, saying: 'Whose is the land?' saying also: 'Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring over all Israel unto thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he said: 'Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee, that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul's son, saying: 'Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him: 'Go, return'; and he returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying: 'In times past ye sought for David to be king over you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">now then do it; for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying: By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Abner said unto David: 'I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth.' And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying: 'Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Joab came to the king, and said: 'What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from Bor-sirah; but David knew it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the groin, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And afterward when David heard it, he said: 'I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him: 'Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and wail before Abner.' And king David followed the bier.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the king lamented for Abner, and said: Should Abner die as a churl dieth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters; as a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall. And all the people wept again over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying: 'God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; whatsoever the king did, pleased all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the king said unto his servants: 'Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And I am this day weak, and just anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me; the LORD reward the evildoer according to his wickedness.'</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were affrighted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands; the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin; for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled; and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish- bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him in the groin; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bed-chamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king: 'Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, who sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them: 'As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">when one told me, saying: Behold, Saul is dead, and he was in his own eyes as though he brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, instead of giving a reward for his tidings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spoke, saying: 'Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that didst lead out and bring in Israel; and the LORD said to thee: Thou shalt feed My people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke unto David, saying: 'Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither'; thinking: 'David cannot come in hither.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David said on that day: 'Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, and getteth up to the gutter, and  taketh away  the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul--.' Wherefore they say: 'There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And David waxed greater and greater; for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for His people Israel's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And David inquired of the LORD, saying: 'Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt Thou deliver them into my hand?' And the LORD said unto David: 'Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said: 'The LORD hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters.' Therefore the name of that place was called Baal-perazim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when David inquired of the LORD, He said: 'Thou shalt not go up; make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is the LORD gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And David did so, as the LORD commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whereupon is called the Name, even the name of the LORD of hosts that sitteth upon the cherubim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD with all manner of instruments made of cypress-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with sistra, and with cymbals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David was displeased, because the LORD had broken forth upon Uzzah; and that place was called Perez-uzzah,    unto this day</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David was afraid of the LORD that day; and he said: 'How shall the ark of the LORD come unto me?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months; and the LORD blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he took the crown of Malcam from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln; and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Amnon was so distressed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do any thing unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said unto him: 'Why, O son of the king, art thou thus becoming leaner from day to day? wilt thou not tell me?' And Amnon said unto him: 'I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jonadab said unto him: 'Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick; and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him: Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick; and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king: 'Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then David sent home to Tamar, saying: 'Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was lying down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said: 'Have out all men from me.' And they went out every man from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Amnon said unto Tamar: 'Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat of thy hand.' And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her: 'Come lie with me, my sister.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And she answered him: 'Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel; do not thou this wanton deed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the base men in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her: 'Arise, be gone.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And she said unto him: 'Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is worse than the other that thou didst unto me.' But he would not hearken unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said: 'Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.'--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now she had a garment of many colours upon her; for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled.- -And his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of many colours that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Absalom her brother said unto her: 'Hath Amnon    thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart.' So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Absalom spoke unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the king's sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Absalom came to the king, and said: 'Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the king said to Absalom: 'Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee.' And he pressed him; howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then said Absalom: 'If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us.' And the king said unto him: 'Why should he go with thee?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Absalom commanded his servants, saying: 'Mark ye now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you: Smite Amnon, then kill him, fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up upon his mule, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying: 'Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said: 'Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people in a roundabout way by the hill-side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Jonadab said unto the king: 'Behold, the king's sons are come; as thy servant said, so it is.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept; and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And  David  mourned for his son every day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the soul of king David failed with longing for Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her: 'I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him.' So Joab put the words in her mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and prostrated herself, and said: 'Help, O king.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king said unto her: 'What aileth thee?' And she answered: 'Of a truth I am a widow, my husband being dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they said: Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the king said unto the woman: 'Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king: 'My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king said: 'Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said she: 'I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son.' And he said: 'As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the woman said: 'Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king.' And he said: 'Say on.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the woman said: 'Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person; but let him devise means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid; and thy handmaid said: I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then thy handmaid said: Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be for my comfort; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad; and the LORD thy God be with thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king answered and said unto the woman: 'Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee.' And the woman said: 'Let my lord the king now speak.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the king said: 'Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this?' And the woman answered and said: 'As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing; and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the king said unto Joab: 'Behold now, I have granted this request; go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and prostrated himself, and blessed the king; and Joab said: 'To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favour in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of thy servant.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the king said: 'Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face.' So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty; from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when he polled his head--now it was at every year's end that he polled it; because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it--he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king's weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of a fair countenance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the kings face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him; and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore he said unto his servants: 'See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire.' And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him: 'Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Absalom answered Joab: 'Behold, I sent unto thee, saying: Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say: Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still; now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Absalom used to rise up early, and stand beside the way of the gate; and it was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said: 'Of what city art thou?' And he said: 'Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Absalom said unto him: 'See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Absalom said moreover: 'Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was so, that when any man came nigh to prostrate himself before him, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king: 'I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Aram, saying: If the LORD shall indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the king said unto him: 'Go in peace.' So he arose, and went to Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying: 'As soon as ye hear the sound of the horn, then ye shall say: Absalom is king in Hebron.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not any thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there came a messenger to David, saying: 'The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem: 'Arise, and let us flee; or    else none of us shall escape from Absalom; make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the king's servants said unto the king: 'Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite: 'Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king; for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile from thine own place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren with thee in kindness and truth.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Ittai answered the king, and said: 'As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And David said to Ittai: 'Go and pass over.' And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And all the country wept with a loud voice, as all the people passed over; and as the king passed over the brook Kidron, all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And, lo, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God--but Abiathar went up--until all the people had done passing out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the king said unto Zadok: 'Carry back the ark of God into the city; if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring me back, and show me both it, and His habitation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">but if He say thus: I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let Him do to me as seemeth good unto Him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The king said also unto Zadok the priest: 'Seest thou? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">See, I will tarry in the plains of the wilderness, until there come word from you to announce unto me.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem; and they abode there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And David went up by the ascent of the mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot; and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And one told David, saying: 'Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.' And David said: 'O LORD, I pray Thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the ascent, where God was wont to be worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And David said unto him: 'If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto Me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom: I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye shall hear.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So Hushai David's friend came into the city; and Absalom was at the point of coming into Jerusalem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the king said unto Ziba: 'What meanest thou by these?' And Ziba said: 'The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king said: 'And where is thy master's son?' And Ziba said unto the king: 'Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said: To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said the king to Ziba: 'Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth.' And Ziba said: 'I prostrate myself; let me find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and kept on cursing as he came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And thus said Shimei when he cursed: 'Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king: 'Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king said: 'What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him: Curse David; who then shall say: Wherefore hast thou done so?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants: 'Behold, my son, who came forth of my body, seeketh my life; how much more this Benjamite now? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It may be that the LORD will look on mine eye, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing of me this day.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom: 'Long live the king, long live the king.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Absalom said to Hushai: 'Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Hushai said unto Absalom: 'Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then said Absalom to Ahithophel: 'Give your counsel what we shall do.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Ahithophel said unto Absalom: 'Go in unto thy father's concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father; then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man inquired of the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom: 'Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Hushai said moreover: 'Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are embittered in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some place; and it will come to pass, when they fall upon them at the first, and whosoever heareth it shall say: There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Moreover, if he withdraw himself into a city, then shall all Israel bring up ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the valley until there be not one small stone found there.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Absalom and all the men of Israel said: 'The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.'--For the LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests: 'Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But the people said: 'Thou shalt not go forth; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us; but thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succour us out of the city.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the porch before the temple of the house,    twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And for the house he made windows broad within, and narrow without.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And against the wall of the house he built a side-structure round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the sanctuary;    and he made side-chambers round about;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">the nethermost story of the side-structure was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made rebatements in the wall of the house round about, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house.--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The door for the lowest    row of chambers was in the right side of the house and they went up by winding stairs into the middle row, and out of the middle into the third.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered in the house with planks of cedar over beams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he built the stories of the side-structure against all the house, each five cubits high; and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">'As for this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in My statutes, and execute Mine ordinances, and keep all My commandments to walk in them; then will I establish My word with thee, which I spoke unto David thy father;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">in that I will dwell therein among the children of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house unto the joists of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the joists; he even built them for himself within, for a Sanctuary, even for the most holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the house, that is, the temple before  the Sanctuary  , was forty cubits long.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the cedar on the house within was carved with knops and open flowers; all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he prepared the Sanctuary in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And before the Sanctuary which was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof, overlaid with pure gold, he set an altar, which he covered with cedar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So Solomon overlaid the house    within with pure gold; and he drew chains of gold across the wall before the Sanctuary; and he overlaid it with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished; also the whole altar that belonged to the Sanctuary he overlaid with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And in the Sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub; from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the other cherub was ten cubits; both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And for the entrance of the Sanctuary he made doors of olive-wood, the door-posts within the frame having five angles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And as for the two doors of olive-wood, he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, within a frame four-square;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">and two doors of cypress-wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he carved thereon cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Ziv.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon: the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And it was covered with cedar above upon the side-chambers, that lay on forty and five pillars, fifteen in a row.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there were beams in three rows; and light was over against light in three ranks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And all the doors with their posts were square in the frame; and light was over against light in three ranks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he made the porch of pillars: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and thick beams before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he made the porch of the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment; and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And his house where he might dwell, in the other court, within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had taken to wife, like unto this porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And above were costly stones, after the measure of hewn stones, and cedar-wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the great court round about had three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams, like as the inner court of the house of the LORD, and the court of the porch of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Thus he fashioned the two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high each; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it about;  and so  the other pillar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He also made nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars: seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pomegranates; and so did he for the other capital.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network; and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon each capital.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple; and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work; so was the work of the pillars finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about; the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And it was a hand-breadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held two thousand baths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders; and there were borders between the stays;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and on the borders that were between the stays were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the stays it was in like manner above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters; beneath the laver were the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the mouth of it within the crown and above was a cubit high; and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were gravings; and their borders were foursquare, not round.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the four wheels were underneath the borders; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel; their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base; the undersetters thereof were of one piece with the base itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the borders thereof were of one piece therewith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">After this manner he made the ten bases; all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and every laver was four cubits; and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Hiram    made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of the LORD:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins; even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of the LORD, were of burnished brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many; the weight of the brass could not be found out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the LORD: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the Sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the pans, and the fire-pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, that is, of the temple, of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' houses of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto its place, into the Sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place, even before the Sanctuary; but they could not be seen without; and there they are unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then spoke Solomon: The LORD hath said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I have surely built Thee a house of habitation, a place for Thee to dwell in for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel; and all the congregation of Israel stood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said: 'Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth unto David my father, and hath with His hand fulfilled it, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Since the day that I brought forth My people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that My name might be there; but I chose David to be over My people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the LORD said unto David my father: Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for My name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for My name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the LORD hath established His word that He spoke; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which He made with our fathers, when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and he said: 'O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like Thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and mercy with Thy servants, that walk before Thee with all their heart;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">who hast kept with Thy servant David my father that which Thou didst promise him; yea, Thou spokest with Thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with Thy hand, as it is this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with Thy servant David my father that which Thou hast promised him saying: There shall not fail thee a man in My sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before Me as thou hast walked before Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now therefore, O God of Israel, let Thy word, I pray Thee, be verified, which Thou didst speak unto Thy servant David my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But will God in very truth dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee; how much less this house that I have builded!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Yet have Thou respect unto the prayer of Thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which Thy servant prayeth before Thee this day;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">that Thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof Thou hast said: My name shall be there; to hearken unto the prayer which Thy servant shall pray toward this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And hearken Thou to the supplication of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place; yea, hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place; and when Thou hearest, forgive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be exacted of him to cause him to swear, and he come and swear before Thine altar in this house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">then hear Thou in heaven, and do, and judge Thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When Thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy, when they do sin against Thee, if they turn again to Thee, and confess Thy name, and pray and make supplication unto Thee in this house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">then hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy people Israel, and bring them back unto the land which Thou gavest unto their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, when they do sin against Thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess Thy name, and turn from their sin, when Thou dost afflict them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">then hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy servants, and of Thy people Israel, when Thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon Thy land, which Thou hast given to Thy people for an inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man of all Thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">then hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart Thou knowest--for Thou, even Thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">that they may fear Thee all the days that they live in the land which Thou gavest unto our fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Moreover concerning the stranger that is not of Thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for Thy name's sake- -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">for they shall hear of Thy great name, and of Thy mighty hand, and of Thine outstretched arm--when he shall come and pray toward this house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to Thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy name, to fear Thee, as doth Thy people Israel, and that they may know that Thy name is called upon this house which I have built.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">If Thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatsoever way Thou shalt send them, and they pray unto the LORD toward the city which Thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Thy name;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">then hear Thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">If they sin against Thee--for there is no man that sinneth not--and Thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, far off or near;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn back, and make supplication unto Thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying: We have sinned, and have done iniquitously, we have dealt wickedly;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">if they return unto Thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray unto Thee toward their land, which Thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which Thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for Thy name;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">then hear Thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven Thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and forgive Thy people who have sinned against Thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against Thee; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">for they are Thy people, and Thine inheritance, which Thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">that Thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of Thy servant, and unto the supplication of Thy people Israel, to hearken unto them whensoever they cry unto Thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">For Thou didst set them apart from among all the peoples of the earth, to be Thine inheritance, as Thou didst speak by the hand of Moses Thy servant, when Thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">'Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto His people Israel, according to all that He promised; there hath not failed one word of all His good promise, which He promised by the hand of Moses His servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">The LORD our God be with us, as He was with our fathers; let Him not leave us, nor forsake us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">that He may incline our hearts unto Him, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments, and His statutes, and His ordinances, which He commanded our fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that He maintain the cause of His servant, and the cause of His people Israel, as every day shall require;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD, He is God; there is none else.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Let your heart therefore be whole with the LORD our God, to walk in His statutes, and to keep His commandments, as at this day.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD; for there he offered the burnt- offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings; because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entrance Hamath unto the Brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had shown unto David His servant, and to Israel His people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's delight which he was pleased to do,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And the famine was sore in Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household.--Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Ahab said unto Obadiah: 'Go through the land, unto all the springs of water, and unto all the brooks; peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him; and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said: 'Is it thou, my lord Elijah?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he answered him: 'It is I; go, tell thy lord: Behold, Elijah is here.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said: 'Wherein have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee; and when they said: He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now thou sayest: Go, tell thy lord: Behold, Elijah is here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it will come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the spirit of the LORD will carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me; but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And now thou sayest: Go, tell thy lord: Behold, Elijah is here; and he will slay me.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Elijah said: 'As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him to-day.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him: 'Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he answered: 'I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed the Baalim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, that eat at Jezebel's table.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Elijah came near unto all the people, and said: 'How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.' And the people answered him not a word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then said Elijah unto the people: 'I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD; and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God.' And all the people answered and said: 'It is well spoken.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal: 'Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying: 'O Baal, answer us.' But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they danced in halting wise about the altar which was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said: 'Cry aloud; for he is a god; either he is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with swords and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening offering; but their was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Elijah said unto all the people: 'Come near unto me'; and all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was thrown down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying: 'Israel shall be thy name.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he said: 'Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.' And he said: 'Do it the second time'; and they did it the second time. And he said: 'Do it the third time'; and they did it the third time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening offering, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said: 'O LORD, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that Thou art God in Israel, and that I am Thy servant, and that I have done all these things at Thy word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that Thou, LORD, art God, for Thou didst turn their heart backward.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said: 'The LORD, He is God; the LORD, He is God.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Elijah said unto them: 'Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.' And they took them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Elijah said unto Ahab: 'Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he said to his servant: 'Go up now, look toward the sea.' And he went up, and looked, and said: 'There is nothing.' And he said: 'Go again seven times.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said: 'Behold, there ariseth a cloud out of the sea, as small as a man's hand.' And he said: 'Go up, say unto Ahab: Make ready thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And it came to pass in a little while, that the heaven grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying: 'So let the gods do  to me  , and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom-tree; and he requested for himself that he might die; and said: 'It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he lay down and slept under a broom-tree; and, behold, an angel touched him, and said unto him: 'Arise and eat.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the hot stones, and a cruse of water. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said: 'Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meal forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and He said unto him: 'What doest thou here, Elijah?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said: 'I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And He said: 'Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.' And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said: 'What doest thou here, Elijah?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said: 'I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the LORD said unto him: 'Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when thou comest, thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over Aram;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth; and Elijah passed over unto him, and cast his mantle upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said: 'Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.' And he said unto him: 'Go back; for what have I done to thee?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Ben-hadad the king of Aram gathered all his host together; and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and said unto him: 'Thus saith Ben-hadad: Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king of Israel answered and said: 'It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king: I am thine, and all that I have.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the messengers came again, and said: 'Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying: I sent indeed unto thee, saying: Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but I will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said: 'Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief; for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And all the elders and all the people said unto him: 'Hearken thou not, neither consent.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad: 'Tell my lord the king: All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do.' And the messengers departed, and brought him back word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said: 'The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the king of Israel answered and said: 'Tell him: Let not him that girdeth on his armour boast himself as he that putteth it off.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it came to pass, when  Ben-hadad  heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the booths, that he said unto his servants: 'Set yourselves in array.' And they set themselves in array against the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And, behold, a prophet came near unto Ahab king of Israel, and said: 'Thus saith the LORD: Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Ahab said: 'By whom?' And he said: 'Thus saith the LORD: By the young men of the princes of the provinces.' Then he said: 'Who shall begin the battle?' And he answered: 'Thou.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying: 'There are men come out from Samaria.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said: 'Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they are come out for war, take them alive.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they slew every one his man; and the Arameans fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-hadad the king of Aram escaped on a horse with horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Arameans with a great slaughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said unto him: 'Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the return of the year the king of Aram will come up against thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the servants of the king of Aram said unto him: 'Their God is a God of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put governors in their room:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.' And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them; and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Arameans filled the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And a man of God came near and spoke unto the king of Israel, and said: 'Thus saith the LORD: Because the Arameans have said: The LORD is a God of the hills, but he is not a God of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel slew of the Arameans a hundred thousand footmen in one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And his servants said unto him: 'Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings; let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; peradventure he will save thy life.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said: 'Thy servant Ben-hadad saith: I pray thee, let me live.' And he said: 'Is he yet alive? he is my brother.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now the men took it for a sign, and hastened to catch it from him; and they said: 'Thy brother Ben-hadad.' Then he said: 'Go ye, bring him.' Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into his chariot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And  Ben-hadad  said unto him: 'The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.' 'And I  ,said Ahab,  will let thee go with this covenant.' So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of the LORD: 'Smite me, I pray thee.' And the man refused to smite him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then said he unto him: 'Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.' And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him; and slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then he found another man, and said: 'Smite me, I pray thee.' And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king; and he said: 'Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said: Keep this man; if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone.' And the king of Israel said unto him: 'So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he hastened, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he said unto him: 'Thus saith the LORD: Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And the king of Israel went to his house sullen and displeased, and came to Samaria.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Ahab spoke unto Naboth, saying: 'Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Naboth said to Ahab: 'The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Ahab came into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said: 'I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.' And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him: 'Why is thy spirit so sullen, that thou eatest no bread?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said unto her: 'Because I spoke unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him: Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it; and he answered: I will not give thee my vineyard.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jezebel his wife said unto him: 'Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry; I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, and that dwelt with Naboth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she wrote in the letters, saying: 'Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying: Thou didst curse God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he die.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him; and the base fellows bore witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying: 'Naboth did curse God and the king.' Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then they sent to Jezebel, saying: 'Naboth is stoned, and is dead.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab: 'Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">'Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwelleth in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And thou shalt speak unto him, saying: Thus saith the LORD: Hast thou killed, and also taken possessions? and thou shalt speak unto him, saying: Thus saith the LORD: In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Ahab said to Elijah: 'Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?' And he answered: 'I have found thee; because thou hast given thyself over to do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away, and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasa the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked Me, and hast made Israel to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying: The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the moat of Jezreel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But there was none like unto Ahab, who did give himself over to do that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king of Israel said unto his servants: 'Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Aram?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said unto Jehoshaphat: 'Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead?' And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel: 'I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel: 'Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD today.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them: 'Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?' And they said: 'Go up; for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Jehoshaphat said: 'Is there not here besides a prophet of the LORD, that we might inquire of him?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: 'There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.' And Jehoshaphat said: 'Let not the king say so.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said: 'Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in a threshing-floor, at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said: 'Thus saith the LORD: With these shalt thou gore the Arameans, until they be consumed.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: 'Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said: 'Therefore hear thou the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on his left.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And the LORD said unto him: Wherewith? And he said: I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And He said: Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also; go forth, and do so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the check, and said: 'Which way went the spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Micaiah said: 'Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat: 'I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.' And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now the king of Aram had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying: 'Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said: 'Surely it is the king of Israel'; and they turned aside to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat cried out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the lower armour and the breastplate; wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot: 'Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the battle increased that day; and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Arameans, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying: 'Every man to his city, and every man to his country.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Aram, was a great man with his master, and held in esteem, because by him the LORD had given victory unto Aram; he was also a mighty man of valour, but he was a leper.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying: 'Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And Naaman said: 'Be content, take two talents.' And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bore them before him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and unto them that brought up  the sons of  Ahab, saying:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And he that was over the household, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and they that brought up the children, sent to Jehu, saying: 'We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any man king; do thou that which is good in thine eyes.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying: 'If ye be on my side, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to-morrow this time.'

      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them unto him to Jezreel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And they broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house, unto this day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, had been put before the tabernacle of the LORD; and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee, and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying: 'As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein  ,even so deal with me  .</VERS>

This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the house which I build is great; for great is our God above all gods.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And the greater house he covered with cypress-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm-trees and chains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty; and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he made the most holy place; the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he made chains in the Sanctuary, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was a handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">He made also the bases, and the lavers made he upon the bases;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels thereof, did Huram his master craftsman make for king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD filled the LORD'S house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And all the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD was upon the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and prostrated themselves, and gave thanks unto the LORD; 'for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made, to give thanks unto the LORD, for His mercy endureth for ever, with the praises of David by their hand; and the priests sounded trumpets over against them; and all Israel stood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD; for there he offered the burnt- offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings; because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt- offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath unto the Brook of Egypt.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate; for so had David the man of God commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And the young men that were grown up with him spoke unto him, saying: 'Thus shalt thou say unto the people that spoke unto thee, saying: Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them: My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was brought about of God, that the LORD might establish His word, which He spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when all Israel  saw  that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying: 'What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to your tents, O Israel; now see to thine own house, David.' So all Israel departed unto their tents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel presented themselves to him out of all their border.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the Levites left their open land and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest's office unto the LORD;</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came unto Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them: 'Thus saith the LORD: Ye have forsaken Me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said: 'The LORD is righteous.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know My service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all away; he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the door of the king's house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and we have priests ministering unto the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For he said unto Judah: 'Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought the LORD our God; we have sought Him, and He hath given us rest on every side.' So they built and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand; all these were mighty men of valour.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Asa heard these words, even the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the detestable things out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon; for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And Hezekiah spoke encouragingly unto all the Levites that were well skilled in the service of the LORD. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and giving thanks to the LORD, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the whole congregation took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept other seven days with gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep; and priests sanctified themselves in great numbers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Doth not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying: The LORD our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying: Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it shall ye offer?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore let not Hezekiah beguile you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers; how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And his servants spoke yet more against the LORD God, and against His servant Hezekiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He wrote also a letter, to taunt the LORD, the God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying: 'As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver His people out of my hand.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to terrify them, and to affright them; that they might take the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">store-houses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that He might know all that was in his heart.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover-offerings five thousand  small cattle  , and five hundred oxen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests; because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering the portions that were to be burnt and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters were at every gate; they needed not to depart from their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For there were that said: 'We, our sons and our daughters, are many; let us get for them corn, that we may eat and live.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Some also there were that said: 'We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses; let us get corn, because of the dearth.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them: 'Ye lend upon pledge, every one to his brother.' And I held a great assembly against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I said unto them: 'We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that sold themselves unto the heathen; and would ye nevertheless sell your brethren, and should they sell themselves unto us?' Then held they their peace, and found never a word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also I said: 'The thing that ye do is not good; ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, have lent them money and corn. I pray you, let us leave off this exaction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundred pieces of silver, and the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said they: 'We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest.' Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Also I shook out my lap, and said: 'So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied.'

      <VERS vnumber="14">Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the former governors that were before me laid burdens upon the people, and took of them for bread and wine above forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants lorded over the people; but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yea, also I set hand to the work of this wall, neither bought we any land; and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover there were at my table of the Jews and the rulers a hundred and fifty men, beside those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep, also fowls were prepared for me; and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine; yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the service was heavy upon this people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein--though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying: 'Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.' But they thought to do me mischief.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">wherein was written: 'It is reported among the nations, and Geshem    saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou buildest the wall; and thou wouldest be their king, even according to these words.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Then I sent unto him, saying: 'There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they all would have us afraid, saying: 'Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done.' But now, strengthen Thou my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And as for me, I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said: 'Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I said: 'Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, could go into the temple and live? I will not go in.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; for he pronounced this prophecy against me, whereas Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might taunt me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have me put in fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard thereof, that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them; howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the alien mixture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied unto Tobiah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave-offerings for the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king, and after certain days asked I leave of the king;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it grieved me sore; therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers; and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal- offerings and the frankincense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then contended I with the rulers, and said: 'Why is the house of God forsaken?' And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the wine and the oil unto the treasuries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the wards thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In those days saw I in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in heaps of corn, and lading asses therewith; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I forewarned them in the day wherein they sold victuals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them: 'What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath; and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then I forewarned them, and said unto them: 'Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you.' From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Thy mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God: 'Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless even him did the foreign women cause to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to break faith with our God in marrying foreign women?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I chased him from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Thus cleansed I them from everything foreign, and appointed wards for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">NOW IT came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus--this is Ahasuerus who reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the castle,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the army of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty, many days, even a hundred and fourscore days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the castle, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">there were hangings of white, fine cotton, and blue, bordered with cords of fine linen and purple, upon silver rods and pillars of marble; the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of green, and white, and shell, and onyx marble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they gave them drink in vessels of gold--the vessels being diverse one from another--and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel; for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Bizzetha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the chamberlains; therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times--for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat the first in the kingdom:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">'What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, forasmuch as she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Memucan answered before the king and the princes: 'Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples, that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it will be said: The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen say the like unto all the king's princes. So will there arise enough contempt and wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus, and that the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom, great though it be, all the wives will give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the word pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and speak according to the language of his people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was assuaged, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him: 'Let there be sought for the king young virgins fair to look on;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the castle, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai    the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their ointments be given them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti.' And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was a certain Jew in Shushan the castle, whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair the son of Shimei the son of Kish, a Benjamite,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was of beautiful form and fair to look on; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was published, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the castle, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her ointments, with her portions, and the seven maidens, who were meet to be given her out of the king's house; and he advanced her and her maidens to the best place in the house of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not tell it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women, twelve months--for so were the days of their anointing accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six month with sweet odours, and with other ointments of the women--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">when then the maiden came unto the king, whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines; she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, and Mordecai sat in the king's gate--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">in those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the thing became known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king thereof in Mordecai's name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed down, and prostrated themselves before Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor prostrated himself before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai: 'Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's words would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor prostrated himself before him, then was Haman full of wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But it seemed contemptible in his eyes to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai; wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus: 'There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from those of every people; neither keep they the king's laws; therefore it profiteth not the king to suffer them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the king's business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the king said unto Haman: 'The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then were the king's scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof, and there was written, according to all that Haman commanded, unto the king's satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people; to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king's ring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The copy of the writing, to be given out for a decree in every province, was to be published unto all peoples, that they should be ready against that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The posts went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the castle; and the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and he came even before the king's gate; for none might enter within the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Esther's maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly pained; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai; and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he accepted it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king's gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her; and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Esther spoke unto Hathach, and gave him a message unto Mordecai:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">'All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live; but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Mordecai bade them to return answer unto Esther: 'Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father's house will perish; and who knoweth whether thou art not come to royal estate for such a time as this?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">'Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day; I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house; and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THERE was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was whole-hearted and upright, and one that feared God, and shunned evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said: 'It may be that my sons have sinned, and blasphemed God in their hearts.' Thus did Job continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now it fell upon a day, that the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan    came also among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the LORD said unto Satan: 'Whence comest thou?' Then Satan answered the LORD, and said: 'From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the LORD said unto Satan: 'Hast thou considered My servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a whole-hearted and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Satan answered the LORD, and said: 'Doth Job fear God for nought?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Hast not Thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions are increased in the land.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">As for me, is my complaint to man? Or why should I not be impatient?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Turn unto me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">They spend their days in prosperity, and peacefully they go down to the grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Yet they said unto God: 'Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?'--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand; the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? that their calamity cometh upon them? that He distributeth pains in His anger?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">'God layeth up his iniquity for his children!'--let Him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For what pleasure hath he in his house after him? seeing the number of his months is determined.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Have ye not asked them that go by the way; and will ye misdeem their tokens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity, that they are led forth to the day of wrath?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Who said unto God: 'Depart from us'; and what could the Almighty do unto them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yet He filled their houses with good things--but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The righteous saw it, and were glad, and the innocent laugh them to scorn:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Acquaint now thyself with Him, and be at peace; thereby shall thine increase be good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Receive, I pray thee, instruction from His mouth, and lay up His words in thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up--if thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were older than he.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">I also will answer my part, I also will declare mine opinion.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Let us choose for us that which is right; let us know among ourselves what is good.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">In a moment they die, even at midnight; the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away without hand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">We have sinned with our fathers, we have done iniquitously, we have dealt wickedly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Our fathers in Egypt gave no heed unto Thy wonders; they remembered not the multitude of Thy mercies; but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake, that He might make His mighty power to be known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; and He led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And the waters covered their adversaries; there was not one of them left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then believed they His words; they sang His praise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They soon forgot His works; they waited not for His counsel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tried God in the desert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And He gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They were jealous also of Moses in the camp, and of Aaron the holy one of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped a molten image.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thus they exchanged their glory for the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They forgot God their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Wondrous works in the land of Ham, terrible things by the Red Sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach, to turn back His wrath, lest He should destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Moreover, they scorned the desirable land, they believed not His word;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they murmured in their tents, they hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore He swore concerning them, that He would overthrow them in the wilderness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And that He would cast out their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Thus they provoked Him with their doings, and the plague broke in upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then stood up Phinehas, and wrought judgment, and so the plague was stayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And that was counted unto him for righteousness, unto all generations for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses because of them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For they embittered his spirit, and he spoke rashly with his lips.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And they served their idols, which became a snare unto them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Thus were they defiled with their works, and went astray in their doings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against His people, and He abhorred His inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And He gave them into the hand of the nations; and they that hated them ruled over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were subdued under their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Many times did He deliver them; but they were rebellious in their counsel, and sank low through their iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Nevertheless He looked upon their distress, when He heard their cry;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And He remembered for them His covenant, and repented according to the multitude of His mercies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks unto Thy holy name, that we may triumph in Thy praise.</VERS>
