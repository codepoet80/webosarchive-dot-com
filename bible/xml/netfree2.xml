  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="10" bname="2 Samuel" bsname="2Sa">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After the death of Saul, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites, he stayed at Ziklag for two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">On the third day a man arrived from the camp of Saul with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. When he approached David, the man threw himself to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">David asked him, "Where are you coming from?" He replied, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David inquired, "How were things going? Tell me!" He replied, "The people fled from the battle and many of them fell dead. Even Saul and his son Jonathan are dead!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David said to the young man who was telling him this, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The young man who was telling him this said, "I just happened to be on Mount Gilboa and came across Saul leaning on his spear for support. The chariots and leaders of the horsemen were in hot pursuit of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me. I answered, 'Here I am!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He asked me, 'Who are you?' I told him, 'I'm an Amalekite.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said to me, 'Stand over me and finish me off! I'm very dizzy, even though I'm still alive.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So I stood over him and put him to death, since I knew that he couldn't live in such a condition. Then I took the crown which was on his head and the bracelet which was on his arm. I have brought them here to my lord."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">David then grabbed his own clothes and tore them, as did all the men who were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They lamented and wept and fasted until evening because Saul, his son Jonathan, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s people, and the house of Israel had fallen by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">David said to the young man who told this to him, "Where are you from?" He replied, "I am an Amalekite, the son of a resident foreigner."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">David replied to him, "How is it that you were not afraid to reach out your hand to destroy the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s anointed?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then David called one of the soldiers and said, "Come here and strike him down!" So he struck him down, and he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">David said to him, "Your blood be on your own head! Your own mouth has testified against you, saying 'I have put the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s anointed to death.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then David chanted this lament over Saul and his son Jonathan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">(He gave instructions that the people of Judah should be taught "The Bow." Indeed, it is written down in the Book of Yashar.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The beauty of Israel lies slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Don't report it in Gath, don't spread the news in the streets of Ashkelon, or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice, the daughters of the uncircumcised will celebrate!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">O mountains of Gilboa, may there be no dew or rain on you, nor fields of grain offerings! For it was there that the shield of warriors was defiled; the shield of Saul lies neglected without oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">From the blood of the slain, from the fat of warriors, the bow of Jonathan was not turned away. The sword of Saul never returned empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Saul and Jonathan were greatly loved during their lives, and not even in their deaths were they separated. They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet as well as jewelry, who put gold jewelry on your clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">How the warriors have fallen in the midst of battle! Jonathan lies slain on your high places!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I grieve over you, my brother Jonathan! You were very dear to me. Your love was more special to me than the love of women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">How the warriors have fallen! The weapons of war are destroyed!</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Afterward David inquired of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "Should I go up to one of the cities of Judah?" The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> told him, "Go up." David asked, "Where should I go?" The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> replied, "To Hebron."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So David went up, along with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail, formerly the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">David also brought along the men who were with him, each with his family. They settled in the cities of Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The men of Judah came and there they anointed David as king over the people of Judah.David was told, "The people of Jabesh Gilead are the ones who buried Saul."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So David sent messengers to the people of Jabesh Gilead and told them, "May you be blessed by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> because you have shown this kindness to your lord Saul by burying him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now may the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> show you true kindness! I also will reward you, because you have done this deed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now be courageous and prove to be valiant warriors, for your lord Saul is dead. The people of Judah have anointed me as king over them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now Abner son of Ner, the general in command of Saul's army, had taken Saul's son Ish-bosheth and had brought him to Mahanaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He appointed him king over Gilead, the Geshurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Ish-bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he began to rule over Israel. He ruled two years. However, the people of Judah followed David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">David was king in Hebron over the people of Judah for seven and a half years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Abner son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Joab son of Zeruiah and the servants of David also went out and confronted them at the pool of Gibeon. One group stationed themselves on one side of the pool, and the other group on the other side of the pool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Abner said to Joab, "Let the soldiers get up and fight before us." Joab said, "So be it!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they got up and crossed over by number: twelve belonging to Benjamin and to Ish-bosheth son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As they grappled with one another, each one stabbed his opponent with his sword and they fell dead together. So that place is called the Field of Flints; it is in Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the battle was very severe that day; Abner and the men of Israel were overcome by David's soldiers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The three sons of Zeruiah were there - Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. (Now Asahel was as quick on his feet as one of the gazelles in the field.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Asahel chased Abner, without turning to the right or to the left as he followed Abner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Abner turned and asked, "Is that you, Asahel?" He replied, "Yes it is!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Abner said to him, "Turn aside to your right or to your left. Capture one of the soldiers and take his equipment for yourself!" But Asahel was not willing to turn aside from following him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Abner spoke again to Asahel, "Turn aside from following me! I do not want to strike you to the ground. How then could I show my face in the presence of Joab your brother?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But Asahel refused to turn aside. So Abner struck him in the abdomen with the back end of his spear. The spear came out his back; Asahel collapsed on the spot and died there right before Abner. Everyone who now comes to the place where Asahel fell dead pauses in respect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So Joab and Abishai chased Abner. At sunset they came to the hill of Ammah near Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The Benjaminites formed their ranks behind Abner and were like a single army, standing at the top of a certain hill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Abner called out to Joab, "Must the sword devour forever? Don't you realize that this will turn bitter in the end? When will you tell the people to turn aside from pursuing their brothers?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Joab replied, "As surely as God lives, if you had not said this, it would have been morning before the people would have abandoned pursuit of their brothers!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Joab blew the ram's horn and all the people stopped in their tracks. They stopped chasing Israel and ceased fighting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Abner and his men went through the Arabah all that night. They crossed the Jordan River and went through the whole region of Bitron and came to Mahanaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now Joab returned from chasing Abner and assembled all the people. Nineteen of David's soldiers were missing, in addition to Asahel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But David's soldiers had slaughtered the Benjaminites and Abner's men - in all, 360 men had died!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They took Asahel's body and buried him in his father's tomb at Bethlehem. Joab and his men then traveled all that night and reached Hebron by dawn.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">However, the war was prolonged between the house of Saul and the house of David. David was becoming steadily stronger, while the house of Saul was becoming increasingly weaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, born to Ahinoam the Jezreelite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His second son was Kileab, born to Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. His third son was Absalom, the son of Maacah daughter of King Talmai of Geshur.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">His fourth son was Adonijah, the son of Haggith. His fifth son was Shephatiah, the son of Abitail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">His sixth son was Ithream, born to David's wife Eglah. These sons were all born to David in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As the war continued between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was becoming more influential in the house of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Saul had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. Ish-bosheth said to Abner, "Why did you have sexual relations with my father's concubine?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">These words of Ish-bosheth really angered Abner and he said, "Am I the head of a dog that belongs to Judah? This very day I am demonstrating loyalty to the house of Saul your father and to his relatives and his friends! I have not betrayed you into the hand of David. Yet you have accused me of sinning with this woman today!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God will severely judge Abner if I do not do for David exactly what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has promised him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">namely, to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah all the way from Dan to Beer Sheba!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Ish-bosheth was unable to answer Abner with even a single word because he was afraid of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Abner sent messengers to David saying, "To whom does the land belong? Make an agreement with me, and I will do whatever I can to cause all Israel to turn to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So David said, "Good! I will make an agreement with you. I ask only one thing from you. You will not see my face unless you bring Saul's daughter Michal when you come to visit me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth son of Saul with this demand: "Give me my wife Michal whom I acquired for a hundred Philistine foreskins."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So Ish-bosheth took her from her husband Paltiel son of Laish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Her husband went along behind her, weeping all the way to Bahurim. Finally Abner said to him, "Go back!" So he returned home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Abner advised the elders of Israel, "Previously you were wanting David to be your king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Act now! For the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has said to David, 'By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the Philistines and from all their enemies.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Abner spoke privately with the Benjaminites. Abner also went to Hebron to inform David privately of all that Israel and the entire house of Benjamin had agreed to.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When Abner, accompanied by twenty men, came to David in Hebron, David prepared a banquet for Abner and the men who were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Abner said to David, "Let me leave so that I may go and gather all Israel to my lord the king so that they may make an agreement with you. Then you will rule over all that you desire." So David sent Abner away, and he left in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now David's soldiers and Joab were coming back from a raid, bringing a great deal of plunder with them. Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, for David had sent him away and he had left in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, Joab was told: "Abner the son of Ner came to the king; he sent him away, and he left in peace!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Abner has come to you! Why would you send him away? Now he's gone on his way!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">You know Abner the son of Ner! Surely he came here to spy on you and to determine when you leave and when you return and to discover everything that you are doing!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Joab left David and sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the well of Sirah. (But David was not aware of it.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gate as if to speak privately with him. Joab then stabbed him in the abdomen and killed him, avenging the shed blood of his brother Asahel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When David later heard about this, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> of the shed blood of Abner son of Ner!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">May his blood whirl over the head of Joab and the entire house of his father! May the males of Joab's house never cease to have someone with a running sore or a skin disease or one who works at the spindle or one who falls by the sword or one who lacks food!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel in Gibeon during the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">David instructed Joab and all the people who were with him, "Tear your clothes! Put on sackcloth! Lament before Abner!" Now King David followed behind the funeral bier.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So they buried Abner in Hebron. The king cried loudly over Abner's grave and all the people wept too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The king chanted the following lament for Abner:"Should Abner have died like a fool?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Your hands were not bound, and your feet were not put into irons. You fell the way one falls before criminals." All the people wept over him again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then all the people came and encouraged David to eat food while it was still day. But David took an oath saying, "God will punish me severely if I taste bread or anything whatsoever before the sun sets!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">All the people noticed this and it pleased them. In fact, everything the king did pleased all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">All the people and all Israel realized on that day that the killing of Abner son of Ner was not done at the king's instigation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then the king said to his servants, "Do you not realize that a great leader has fallen this day in Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Today I am weak, even though I am anointed as king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too much for me to bear! May the LORD punish appropriately the one who has done this evil thing!"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Ish-bosheth the son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he was very disheartened, and all Israel was afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now Saul's son had two men who were in charge of raiding units; one was named Baanah and the other Recab. They were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, who was a Benjaminite. (Beeroth is regarded as belonging to Benjamin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">for the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have remained there as resident foreigners until the present time.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now Saul's son Jonathan had a son who was crippled in both feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan arrived from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but in her haste to get away, he fell and was injured. Mephibosheth was his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite - Recab and Baanah - went at the hottest part of the day to the home of Ish-bosheth, as he was enjoying his midday rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They entered the house under the pretense of getting wheat and mortally wounded him in the stomach. Then Recab and his brother Baanah escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They had entered the house while Ish-bosheth was resting on his bed in his bedroom. They mortally wounded him and then cut off his head. Taking his head, they traveled on the way of the Arabah all that night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David in Hebron, saying to the king, "Look! The head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul, your enemy who sought your life! The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has granted vengeance to my lord the king this day against Saul and his descendants!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">David replied to Recab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives, who has delivered my life from all adversity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">when someone told me that Saul was dead - even though he thought he was bringing good news - I seized him and killed him in Ziklag. That was the good news I gave to him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Surely when wicked men have killed an innocent man as he slept in his own house, should I not now require his blood from your hands and remove you from the earth?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So David issued orders to the soldiers and they put them to death. Then they cut off their hands and feet and hung them near the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner in Hebron.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron saying, "Look, we are your very flesh and blood!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In the past, when Saul was our king, you were the real leader in Israel. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel; you will rule over Israel.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When all the leaders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, King David made an agreement with them in Hebron before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. They designated David as king over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned for forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In Hebron he reigned over Judah for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the king and his men advanced to Jerusalem against the Jebusites who lived in the land. The Jebusites said to David, "You cannot invade this place! Even the blind and the lame will turn you back, saying, 'David cannot invade this place!'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the city of David).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David said on that day, "Whoever attacks the Jebusites must approach the 'lame' and the 'blind' who are David's enemies by going through the water tunnel." For this reason it is said, "The blind and the lame cannot enter the palace."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So David lived in the fortress and called it the City of David. David built all around it, from the terrace inwards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">David's power grew steadily, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God who commands armies was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons. They built a palace for David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">David realized that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had established him as king over Israel and that he had elevated his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">David married more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he arrived from Hebron. Even more sons and daughters were born to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">These are the names of children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When the Philistines heard that David had been designated king over Israel, they all went up to search for David. When David heard about it, he went down to the fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the Philistines had arrived and spread out in the valley of Rephaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So David asked the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "Should I march up against the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to David, "March up, for I will indeed hand the Philistines over to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So David marched against Baal Perazim and defeated them there. Then he said, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has burst out against my enemies like water bursts out." So he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men picked them up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The Philistines again came up and spread out in the valley of Rephaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So David asked the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> what he should do. This time the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to him, "Don't march straight up. Instead, circle around behind them and come against them opposite the trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the trees, act decisively. For at that moment the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is going before you to strike down the army of the Philistines."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">David did just as the LORD commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines from Gibeon all the way to Gezer.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">David again assembled all the best men in Israel, thirty thousand in number.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">David and all the men who were with him traveled to Baalah in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God which is called by the name of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> of hosts, who sits enthroned between the cherubim that are on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They loaded the ark of God on a new cart and carried it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They brought it with the ark of God up from the house of Abinadab on the hill. Ahio was walking in front of the ark,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">while David and all Israel were energetically celebrating before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, singing and playing various stringed instruments, tambourines, rattles, and cymbals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they arrived at the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out and grabbed hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was so furious with Uzzah, he killed him on the spot for his negligence. He died right there beside the ark of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David was angry because the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> attacked Uzzah; so he called that place Perez Uzzah, which remains its name to this very day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">David was afraid of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> that day and said, "How will the ark of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> ever come to me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So David was no longer willing to bring the ark of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> to be with him in the City of David. David left it in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The ark of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> blessed Obed-Edom and all his family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">David was told, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has blessed the family of Obed-Edom and everything he owns because of the ark of God." So David went and joyfully brought the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">David replied to Michal, "It was before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>! I was celebrating before the Lord, who chose me over your father and his entire family and appointed me as leader over the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s people Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of his palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. Now this woman was very attractive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So David sent someone to inquire about the woman. The messenger said, "Isn't this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David sent some messengers to get her. She came to him and he had sexual relations with her. (Now at that time she was in the process of purifying herself from her menstrual uncleanness.) Then she returned to her home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The woman conceived and then sent word to David saying, "I'm pregnant."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">When Uriah came to him, David asked about how Joab and the army were doing and how the campaign was going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your home and relax." When Uriah left the palace, the king sent a gift to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Uriah stayed at the door of the palace with all the servants of his lord. He did not go down to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they informed David, "Uriah has not gone down to his house." So David said to Uriah, "Haven't you just arrived from a journey? Why haven't you gone down to your house?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Uriah replied to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah reside in temporary shelters, and my lord Joab and my lord's soldiers are camping in the open field. Should I go to my house to eat and drink and have marital relations with my wife? As surely as you are alive, I will not do this thing!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So David said to Uriah, "Stay here another day. Tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem both that day and the following one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then David summoned him. He ate and drank with him, and got him drunk. But in the evening he went out to sleep on his bed with the servants of his lord; he did not go down to his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In the letter he wrote: "Station Uriah in the thick of the battle and then withdraw from him so he will be cut down and killed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So as Joab kept watch on the city, he stationed Uriah at the place where he knew the best enemy soldiers were.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, some of David's soldiers fell in battle. Uriah the Hittite also died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Joab sent a full battle report to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He instructed the messenger as follows: "When you finish giving the battle report to the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">if the king becomes angry and asks you, 'Why did you go so close to the city to fight? Didn't you realize they would shoot from the wall?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Who struck down Abimelech the son of Jerub-Besheth? Didn't a woman throw an upper millstone down on him from the wall so that he died in Thebez? Why did you go so close to the wall?' just say to him, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the messenger departed. When he arrived, he informed David of all the news that Joab had sent with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The messenger said to David, "The men overpowered us and attacked us in the field. But we forced them to retreat all the way to the door of the city gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall and some of the king's soldiers died. Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">David said to the messenger, "Tell Joab, 'Don't let this thing upset you. There is no way to anticipate whom the sword will cut down. Press the battle against the city and conquer it.' Encourage him with these words."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When Uriah's wife heard that her husband Uriah was dead, she mourned for him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> sent Nathan to David. When he came to David, Nathan said, "There were two men in a certain city, one rich and the other poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The rich man had a great many flocks and herds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But the poor man had nothing except for a little lamb he had acquired. He raised it, and it grew up alongside him and his children. It used to eat his food, drink from his cup, and sleep in his arms. It was just like a daughter to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">"When a traveler arrived at the rich man's home, he did not want to use one of his own sheep or cattle to feed the traveler who had come to visit him. Instead, he took the poor man's lamb and cooked it for the man who had come to visit him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then David became very angry at this man. He said to Nathan, "As surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives, the man who did this deserves to die!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Because he committed this cold-hearted crime, he must pay for the lamb four times over!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Nathan said to David, "You are that man! This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel says: 'I chose you to be king over Israel and I rescued you from the hand of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I gave you your master's house, and put your master's wives into your arms. I also gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if all that somehow seems insignificant, I would have given you so much more as well!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Why have you shown contempt for the word of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> by doing evil in my sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and you have taken his wife as your own! You have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So now the sword will never depart from your house. For you have despised me by taking the wife of Uriah the Hittite as your own!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says: 'I am about to bring disaster on you from inside your own household! Right before your eyes I will take your wives and hand them over to your companion. He will have sexual relations with your wives in broad daylight!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Although you have acted in secret, I will do this thing before all Israel, and in broad daylight.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then David exclaimed to Nathan, "I have sinned against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>!" Nathan replied to David, "Yes, and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has forgiven your sin. You are not going to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nonetheless, because you have treated the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> with such contempt in this matter, the son who has been born to you will certainly die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Nathan went to his home. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> struck the child that Uriah's wife had borne to David, and the child became very ill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then David prayed to God for the child and fasted. He would even go and spend the night lying on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The elders of his house stood over him and tried to lift him from the ground, but he was unwilling, and refused to eat food with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">On the seventh day the child died. But the servants of David were afraid to inform him that the child had died, for they said, "While the child was still alive he would not listen to us when we spoke to him. How can we tell him that the child is dead? He will do himself harm!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When David saw that his servants were whispering to one another, he realized that the child was dead. So David asked his servants, "Is the child dead?" They replied, "Yes, he's dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So David got up from the ground, bathed, put on oil, and changed his clothes. He went to the house of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and worshiped. Then, when he entered his palace, he requested that food be brought to him, and he ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">His servants said to him, "What is this that you have done? While the child was still alive, you fasted and wept. Once the child was dead you got up and ate food!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He replied, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept because I thought, 'Perhaps the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will show pity and the child will live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Am I able to bring him back? I will go to him, but he cannot return to me!'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He went to her and had marital relations with her. She gave birth to a son, and David named him Solomon. Now the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> loved the child</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and sent word through Nathan the prophet that he should be named Jedidiah for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Joab then sent messengers to David, saying, "I have fought against Rabbah and have captured the water supply of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So now assemble the rest of the army and besiege the city and capture it. Otherwise I will capture the city and it will be named for me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So David assembled all the army and went to Rabbah and fought against it and captured it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He took the crown of their king from his head - it was gold, weighed about seventy-five pounds, and held a precious stone - and it was placed on David's head. He also took from the city a great deal of plunder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He removed the people who were in it and made them do hard labor with saws, iron picks, and iron axes, putting them to work at the brick kiln. This was his policy with all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now David's son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar. In the course of time David's son Amnon fell madly in love with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But Amnon became frustrated because he was so lovesick over his sister Tamar. For she was a virgin, and to Amnon it seemed out of the question to do anything to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shimeah. Jonadab was a very crafty man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He asked Amnon, "Why are you, the king's son, so depressed every morning? Can't you tell me?" So Amnon said to him, "I'm in love with Tamar the sister of my brother Absalom."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jonadab replied to him, "Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes in to see you, say to him, 'Please let my sister Tamar come in so she can fix some food for me. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I can watch. Then I will eat from her hand.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. When the king came in to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Please let my sister Tamar come in so she can make a couple of cakes in my sight. Then I will eat from her hand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So David sent Tamar to the house saying, "Please go to the house of Amnon your brother and prepare some food for him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother, who was lying down. She took the dough, kneaded it, made some cakes while he watched, and baked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when she took the pan and set it before him, he refused to eat. Instead Amnon said, "Get everyone out of here!" So everyone left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the cakes into the bedroom; then I will eat from your hand." So Tamar took the cakes that she had prepared and brought them to her brother Amnon in the bedroom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As she brought them to him to eat, he grabbed her and said to her, "Come on! Get in bed with me, my sister!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But she said to him, "No, my brother! Don't humiliate me! This just isn't done in Israel! Don't do this foolish thing!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">How could I ever be rid of my humiliation? And you would be considered one of the fools in Israel! Just speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But he refused to listen to her. He overpowered her and humiliated her by raping her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Amnon greatly despised her. His disdain toward her surpassed the love he had previously felt toward her. Amnon said to her, "Get up and leave!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But she said to him, "No I won't, for sending me away now would be worse than what you did to me earlier!" But he refused to listen to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He called his personal attendant and said to him, "Take this woman out of my sight and lock the door behind her!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">(Now she was wearing a long robe, for this is what the king's virgin daughters used to wear.) So Amnon's attendant removed her and bolted the door behind her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe she was wearing. She put her hands on her head and went on her way, wailing as she went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Her brother Absalom said to her, "Was Amnon your brother with you? Now be quiet, my sister. He is your brother. Don't take it so seriously!" Tamar, devastated, lived in the house of her brother Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now King David heard about all these things and was very angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Absalom said nothing to Amnon, either bad or good, yet Absalom hated Amnon because he had humiliated his sister Tamar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Two years later Absalom's sheepshearers were in Baal Hazor, near Ephraim. Absalom invited all the king's sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Absalom went to the king and said, "My shearers have begun their work. Let the king and his servants go with me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But the king said to Absalom, "No, my son. We shouldn't all go. We shouldn't burden you in that way." Though Absalom pressed him, the king was not willing to go. Instead, David blessed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Absalom said, "If you will not go, then let my brother Amnon go with us." The king replied to him, "Why should he go with you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when Absalom pressed him, he sent Amnon and all the king's sons along with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Absalom instructed his servants, "Look! When Amnon is drunk and I say to you, 'Strike Amnon down,' kill him then and there. Don't fear! Is it not I who have given you these instructions? Be strong and courageous!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So Absalom's servants did to Amnon exactly what Absalom had instructed. Then all the king's sons got up; each one rode away on his mule and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">While they were still on their way, the following report reached David: "Absalom has killed all the king's sons; not one of them is left!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the king stood up and tore his garments and lay down on the ground. All his servants were standing there with torn garments as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shimeah, said, "My lord should not say, 'They have killed all the young men who are the king's sons.' For only Amnon is dead. This is what Absalom has talked about from the day that Amnon humiliated his sister Tamar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now don't let my lord the king be concerned about the report that has come saying, 'All the king's sons are dead.' It is only Amnon who is dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">In the meantime Absalom fled. When the servant who was the watchman looked up, he saw many people coming from the west on a road beside the hill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jonadab said to the king, "Look! The king's sons have come! It's just as I said!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Just as he finished speaking, the king's sons arrived, wailing and weeping. The king and all his servants wept loudly as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Absalom fled and went to King Talmai son of Ammihud of Geshur. And David grieved over his son every day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he remained there for three years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The king longed to go to Absalom, for he had since been consoled over the death of Amnon.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Joab son of Zeruiah realized that the king longed to see Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman. He told her, "Pretend to be in mourning and put on garments for mourning. Don't anoint yourself with oil. Instead, act like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for some time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Go to the king and speak to him in the following fashion." Then Joab told her what to say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So the Tekoan woman went to the king. She bowed down with her face to the ground in deference to him and said, "Please help me, O king!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king replied to her, "What do you want?" She answered, "I am a widow; my husband is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Your servant has two sons. When the two of them got into a fight in the field, there was no one present who could intervene. One of them struck the other and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now the entire family has risen up against your servant, saying, 'Turn over the one who struck down his brother, so that we can execute him and avenge the death of his brother whom he killed. In so doing we will also destroy the heir.' They want to extinguish my remaining coal, leaving no one on the face of the earth to carry on the name of my husband."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the king told the woman, "Go to your home. I will give instructions concerning your situation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Tekoan woman said to the king, "My lord the king, let any blame fall on me and on the house of my father. But let the king and his throne be innocent!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The king said, "Bring to me whoever speaks to you, and he won't bother you again!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">She replied, "In that case, let the king invoke the name of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God so that the avenger of blood may not kill! Then they will not destroy my son!" He replied, "As surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives, not a single hair of your son's head will fall to the ground."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the woman said, "Please permit your servant to speak to my lord the king about another matter." He replied, "Tell me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The woman said, "Why have you devised something like this against God's people? When the king speaks in this fashion, he makes himself guilty, for the king has not brought back the one he has banished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Certainly we must die, and are like water spilled on the ground that cannot be gathered up again. But God does not take away life; instead he devises ways for the banished to be restored.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I have now come to speak with my lord the king about this matter, because the people have made me fearful. But your servant said, 'I will speak to the king! Perhaps the king will do what his female servant asks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yes! The king may listen and deliver his female servant from the hand of the man who seeks to remove both me and my son from the inheritance God has given us!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So your servant said, 'May the word of my lord the king be my security, for my lord the king is like the angel of God when it comes to deciding between right and wrong! May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God be with you!'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king replied to the woman, "Don't hide any information from me when I question you." The woman said, "Let my lord the king speak!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The king said, "Did Joab put you up to all of this?" The woman answered, "As surely as you live, my lord the king, there is no deviation to the right or to the left from all that my lord the king has said. For your servant Joab gave me instructions. He has put all these words in your servant's mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Your servant Joab did this so as to change this situation. But my lord has wisdom like that of the angel of God, and knows everything that is happening in the land."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then the king said to Joab, "All right! I will do this thing! Go and bring back the young man Absalom!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Joab bowed down with his face toward the ground and thanked the king. Joab said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, because the king has granted the request of your servant!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the king said, "Let him go over to his own house. He may not see my face." So Absalom went over to his own house; he did not see the king's face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now in all Israel everyone acknowledged that there was no man as handsome as Absalom. From the sole of his feet to the top of his head he was perfect in appearance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When he would shave his head - at the end of every year he used to shave his head, for it grew too long and he would shave it - he used to weigh the hair of his head at three pounds according to the king's weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Absalom had three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a very attractive woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing the king's face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Absalom sent a message to Joab asking him to send him to the king, but Joab was not willing to come to him. So he sent a second message to him, but he still was not willing to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So he said to his servants, "Look, Joab has a portion of field adjacent to mine and he has some barley there. Go and set it on fire." So Absalom's servants set Joab's portion of the field on fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Joab got up and came to Absalom's house. He said to him, "Why did your servants set my portion of field on fire?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Absalom said to Joab, "Look, I sent a message to you saying, 'Come here so that I can send you to the king with this message: "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there."' Let me now see the face of the king. If I am at fault, let him put me to death!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Joab went to the king and informed him. The king summoned Absalom, and he came to the king. Absalom bowed down before the king with his face toward the ground and the king kissed him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Some time later Absalom managed to acquire a chariot and horses, as well as fifty men to serve as his royal guard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now Absalom used to get up early and stand beside the road that led to the city gate. Whenever anyone came by who had a complaint to bring to the king for arbitration, Absalom would call out to him, "What city are you from?" The person would answer, "I, your servant, am from one of the tribes of Israel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Absalom would then say to him, "Look, your claims are legitimate and appropriate. But there is no representative of the king who will listen to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Absalom would then say, "If only they would make me a judge in the land! Then everyone who had a judicial complaint could come to me and I would make sure he receives a just settlement."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When someone approached to bow before him, Absalom would extend his hand and embrace him and kiss him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Absalom acted this way toward everyone in Israel who came to the king for justice. In this way Absalom won the loyalty of the citizens of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After four years Absalom said to the king, "Let me go and repay my vow that I made to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> while I was in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For I made this vow when I was living in Geshur in Aram: 'If the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> really does allow me to return to Jerusalem, I will serve the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The king replied to him, "Go in peace." So Absalom got up and went to Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Absalom sent spies through all the tribes of Israel who said, "When you hear the sound of the horn, you may assume that Absalom rules in Hebron."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now two hundred men had gone with Absalom from Jerusalem. Since they were invited, they went naively and were unaware of what Absalom was planning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">While he was offering sacrifices, Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's adviser, to come from his city, Giloh. The conspiracy was gaining momentum, and the people were starting to side with Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then a messenger came to David and reported, "The men of Israel are loyal to Absalom!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, "Come on! Let's escape! Otherwise no one will be delivered from Absalom! Go immediately, or else he will quickly overtake us and bring disaster on us and kill the city's residents with the sword."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The king's servants replied to the king, "We will do whatever our lord the king decides."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So the king and all the members of his royal court set out on foot, though the king left behind ten concubines to attend to the palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The king and all the people set out on foot, pausing at a spot some distance away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">All his servants were leaving with him, along with all the Kerethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites - some six hundred men who had come on foot from Gath. They were leaving with the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why should you come with us? Go back and stay with the new king, for you are a foreigner and an exile from your own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">It seems like you arrived just yesterday. Today should I make you wander around by going with us? I go where I must go. But as for you, go back and take your men with you. May genuine loyal love protect you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Ittai replied to the king, "As surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king is, whether dead or alive, there I will be as well!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So David said to Ittai, "Come along then." So Ittai the Gittite went along, accompanied by all his men and all the dependents who were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All the land was weeping loudly as all these people were leaving. As the king was crossing over the Kidron Valley, all the people were leaving on the road that leads to the desert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Zadok and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. When they positioned the ark of God, Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then the king said to Zadok, "Take the ark of God back to the city. If I find favor in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s sight he will bring me back and enable me to see both it and his dwelling place again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">However, if he should say, 'I do not take pleasure in you,' then he will deal with me in a way that he considers appropriate."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The king said to Zadok the priest, "Are you a seer? Go back to the city in peace! Your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan may go with you and Abiathar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Look, I will be waiting at the fords of the desert until word from you reaches me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and remained there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">As David was going up the Mount of Olives, he was weeping as he went; his head was covered and his feet were bare. All the people who were with him also had their heads covered and were weeping as they went up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now David had been told, "Ahithophel has sided with the conspirators who are with Absalom. So David prayed, "Make the advice of Ahithophel foolish, O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">When David reached the summit, where he used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite met him with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">David said to him, "If you leave with me you will be a burden to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But you will be able to counter the advice of Ahithophel if you go back to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king! Previously I was your father's servant, and now I will be your servant.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there with you. Everything you hear in the king's palace you must tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Furthermore, their two sons are there with them, Zadok's son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan. You must send them to me with any information you hear."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So David's friend Hushai arrived in the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When David had gone a short way beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him. He had a couple of donkeys that were saddled, and on them were two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred raisin cakes, a hundred baskets of summer fruit, and a container of wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The king asked Ziba, "Why did you bring these things?" Ziba replied, "The donkeys are for the king's family to ride on, the loaves of bread and the summer fruit are for the attendants to eat, and the wine is for those who get exhausted in the desert."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The king asked, "Where is your master's grandson?" Ziba replied to the king, "He remains in Jerusalem, for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will give back to me my grandfather's kingdom.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The king said to Ziba, "Everything that was Mephibosheth's now belongs to you." Ziba replied, "I bow before you. May I find favor in your sight, my lord the king."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then King David reached Bahurim. There a man from Saul's extended family named Shimei son of Gera came out, yelling curses as he approached.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He threw stones at David and all of King David's servants, as well as all the people and the soldiers who were on his right and on his left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As he yelled curses, Shimei said, "Leave! Leave! You man of bloodshed, you wicked man!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has punished you for all the spilled blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you rule. Now the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. Disaster has overtaken you, for you are a man of bloodshed!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the king said, "What do we have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? If he curses because the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has said to him, 'Curse David!', who can say to him, 'Why have you done this?'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "My own son, my very own flesh and blood, is trying to take my life. So also now this Benjaminite! Leave him alone so that he can curse, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has spoken to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Perhaps the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will notice my affliction and this day grant me good in place of his curse."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So David and his men went on their way. But Shimei kept going along the side of the hill opposite him, yelling curses as he threw stones and dirt at them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The king and all the people who were with him arrived exhausted at their destination, where David refreshed himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now when Absalom and all the men of Israel arrived in Jerusalem, Ahithophel was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When David's friend Hushai the Arkite came to Absalom, Hushai said to him, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Absalom said to Hushai, "Do you call this loyalty to your friend? Why didn't you go with your friend?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Hushai replied to Absalom, "No, I will be loyal to the one whom the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, these people, and all the men of Israel have chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moreover, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give us your advice. What should we do?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Ahithophel replied to Absalom, "Have sex with your father's concubines whom he left to care for the palace. All Israel will hear that you have made yourself repulsive to your father. Then your followers will be motivated to support you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom had sex with his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In those days Ahithophel's advice was considered as valuable as a prophetic revelation. Both David and Absalom highly regarded the advice of Ahithophel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Let me pick out twelve thousand men. Then I will go and pursue David this very night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When I catch up with him he will be exhausted and worn out. I will rout him, and the entire army that is with him will flee. I will kill only the king</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and will bring the entire army back to you. In exchange for the life of the man you are seeking, you will get back everyone. The entire army will return unharmed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">This seemed like a good idea to Absalom and to all the leaders of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But Absalom said, "Call for Hushai the Arkite, and let's hear what he has to say."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Hushai came to Absalom. Absalom said to him, "Here is what Ahithophel has advised. Should we follow his advice? If not, what would you recommend?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Hushai replied to Absalom, "Ahithophel's advice is not sound this time."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Hushai went on to say, "You know your father and his men - they are soldiers and are as dangerous as a bear out in the wild that has been robbed of her cubs. Your father is an experienced soldier; he will not stay overnight with the army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">At this very moment he is hiding out in one of the caves or in some other similar place. If it should turn out that he attacks our troops first, whoever hears about it will say, 'Absalom's army has been slaughtered!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">If that happens even the bravest soldier - one who is lion-hearted - will virtually melt away. For all Israel knows that your father is a warrior and that those who are with him are brave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My advice therefore is this: Let all Israel from Dan to Beer Sheba - in number like the sand by the sea! - be mustered to you, and you lead them personally into battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">We will come against him wherever he happens to be found. We will descend on him like the dew falls on the ground. Neither he nor any of the men who are with him will be spared alive - not one of them!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">If he regroups in a city, all Israel will take up ropes to that city and drag it down to the valley, so that not a single pebble will be left there!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The advice of Hushai the Arkite sounds better than the advice of Ahithophel." Now the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had decided to frustrate the sound advice of Ahithophel, so that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> could bring disaster on Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Hushai reported to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, "Here is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the leaders of Israel to do, and here is what I have advised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now send word quickly to David and warn him, "Don't spend the night at the fords of the desert tonight. Instead, be sure you cross over, or else the king and everyone who is with him may be overwhelmed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying in En Rogel. A female servant would go and inform them, and they would then go and inform King David. It was not advisable for them to be seen going into the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But a young man saw them on one occasion and informed Absalom. So the two of them quickly departed and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. There was a well in his courtyard, and they got down in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">His wife then took the covering and spread it over the top of the well and scattered some grain over it. No one was aware of what she had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When the servants of Absalom approached the woman at her home, they asked, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" The woman replied to them, "They crossed over the stream." Absalom's men searched but did not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">After the men had left, Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed out of the well. Then they left and informed King David. They advised David, "Get up and cross the stream quickly, for Ahithophel has devised a plan to catch you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So David and all the people who were with him got up and crossed the Jordan River. By dawn there was not one person left who had not crossed the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When Ahithophel realized that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and returned to his house in his hometown. After setting his household in order, he hanged himself. So he died and was buried in the grave of his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Meanwhile David had gone to Mahanaim, while Absalom and all the men of Israel had crossed the Jordan River.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Absalom had made Amasa general in command of the army in place of Joab. (Now Amasa was the son of an Israelite man named Jether, who had married Abigail the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The army of Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Makir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">brought bedding, basins, and pottery utensils. They also brought food for David and all who were with him, including wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">honey, curds, flocks, and cheese. For they said, "The people are no doubt hungry, tired, and thirsty there in the desert."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">David assembled the army that was with him. He appointed leaders of thousands and leaders of hundreds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">David then sent out the army - a third under the leadership of Joab, a third under the leadership of Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under the leadership of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the troops, "I too will indeed march out with you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But the soldiers replied, "You should not do this! For if we should have to make a rapid retreat, they won't be too concerned about us. Even if half of us should die, they won't be too concerned about us. But you are like ten thousand of us! So it is better if you remain in the city for support."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the king said to them, "I will do whatever seems best to you."So the king stayed beside the city gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king gave this order to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: "For my sake deal gently with the young man Absalom." Now the entire army was listening when the king gave all the leaders this order concerning Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the army marched out to the field to fight against Israel. The battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The army of Israel was defeated there by David's men. The slaughter there was great that day - 20,000 soldiers were killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The battle there was spread out over the whole area, and the forest consumed more soldiers than the sword devoured that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Absalom happened to come across David's men. Now as Absalom was riding on his mule, it went under the branches of a large oak tree. His head got caught in the oak and he was suspended in midair, while the mule he had been riding kept going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When one of the men saw this, he reported it to Joab saying, "I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Joab replied to the man who was telling him this, "What! You saw this? Why didn't you strike him down right on the spot? I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a commemorative belt!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The man replied to Joab, "Even if I were receiving a thousand pieces of silver, I would not strike the king's son! In our very presence the king gave this order to you and Abishai and Ittai, 'Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">If I had acted at risk of my own life - and nothing is hidden from the king! - you would have abandoned me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Joab replied, "I will not wait around like this for you!" He took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the middle of Absalom while he was still alive in the middle of the oak tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then ten soldiers who were Joab's armor bearers struck Absalom and finished him off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Joab blew the trumpet and the army turned back from chasing Israel, for Joab had called for the army to halt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They took Absalom, threw him into a large pit in the forest, and stacked a huge pile of stones over him. In the meantime all the Israelite soldiers fled to their homes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Prior to this Absalom had set up a monument and dedicated it to himself in the King's Valley, reasoning "I have no son who will carry on my name." He named the monument after himself, and to this day it is known as Absalom's Memorial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, "Let me run and give the king the good news that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has vindicated him before his enemies."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Joab said to him, "You will not be a bearer of good news today. You will bear good news some other day, but not today, for the king's son is dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Joab said to the Cushite, "Go and tell the king what you have seen." After bowing to Joab, the Cushite ran off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Ahimaaz the son of Zadok again spoke to Joab, "Whatever happens, let me go after the Cushite." But Joab said, "Why is it that you want to go, my son? You have no good news that will bring you a reward."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he said, "Whatever happens, I want to go!" So Joab said to him, "Then go!" So Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Jordan plain, and he passed the Cushite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate at the wall. When he looked, he saw a man running by himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So the watchman called out and informed the king. The king said, "If he is by himself, he brings good news." The runner came ever closer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then the watchman saw another man running. The watchman called out to the gatekeeper, "There is another man running by himself." The king said, "This one also is bringing good news."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The watchman said, "It appears to me that the first runner is Ahimaaz son of Zadok." The king said, "He is a good man, and he comes with good news."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, "Greetings!" He bowed down before the king with his face toward the ground and said, "May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God be praised because he has defeated the men who opposed my lord the king!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The king replied, "How is the young man Absalom?" Ahimaaz replied, "I saw a great deal of confusion when Joab was sending the king's servant and me, your servant, but I don't know what it was all about."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The king said, "Turn aside and take your place here." So he turned aside and waited.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the Cushite arrived and said, "May my lord the king now receive the good news! The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has vindicated you today and delivered you from the hand of all who have rebelled against you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The king asked the Cushite, "How is the young man Absalom?" The Cushite replied, "May the enemies of my lord the king and all who have plotted against you be like that young man!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The king then became very upset. He went up to the upper room over the gate and wept. As he went he said, "My son, Absalom! My son, my son, Absalom! If only I could have died in your place! Absalom, my son, my son!"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Joab was told, "The king is weeping and mourning over Absalom."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So the victory of that day was turned to mourning as far as all the people were concerned. For the people heard on that day, "The king is grieved over his son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">That day the people stole away to go to the city the way people who are embarrassed steal away in fleeing from battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The king covered his face and cried out loudly, "My son, Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Joab visited the king at his home. He said, "Today you have embarrassed all your servants who have saved your life this day, as well as the lives of your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your concubines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You seem to love your enemies and hate your friends! For you have as much as declared today that leaders and servants don't matter to you. I realize now that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, it would be all right with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So get up now and go out and give some encouragement to your servants. For I swear by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> that if you don't go out there, not a single man will stay here with you tonight! This disaster will be worse for you than any disaster that has overtaken you from your youth right to the present time!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the king got up and sat at the city gate. When all the people were informed that the king was sitting at the city gate, they all came before him.But the Israelite soldiers had all fled to their own homes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All the people throughout all the tribes of Israel were arguing among themselves saying, "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies. He rescued us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled from the land because of Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Absalom, whom we anointed as our king, has died in battle. So now why do you hesitate to bring the king back?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then King David sent a message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests saying, "Tell the elders of Judah, 'Why should you delay any further in bringing the king back to his palace, when everything Israel is saying has come to the king's attention.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You are my brothers - my very own flesh and blood! Why should you delay any further in bringing the king back?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Say to Amasa, 'Are you not my flesh and blood? God will punish me severely, if from this time on you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab!'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He won over the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man. Then they sent word to the king saying, "Return, you and all your servants as well."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the king returned and came to the Jordan River. Now the people of Judah had come to Gilgal to meet the king and to help him cross the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Shimei son of Gera the Benjaminite from Bahurim came down quickly with the men of Judah to meet King David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">There were a thousand men from Benjamin with him, along with Ziba the servant of Saul's household, and with him his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They hurriedly crossed the Jordan within sight of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They crossed at the ford in order to help the king's household cross and to do whatever he thought appropriate.Now after he had crossed the Jordan, Shimei son of Gera threw himself down before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He said to the king, "Don't think badly of me, my lord, and don't recall the sin of your servant on the day when you, my lord the king, left Jerusalem! Please don't call it to mind!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For I, your servant, know that I sinned, and I have come today as the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Abishai son of Zeruiah replied, "For this should not Shimei be put to death? After all, he cursed the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s anointed!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But David said, "What do we have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? You are like my enemy today! Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Don't you realize that today I am king over Israel?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The king said to Shimei, "You won't die." The king vowed an oath concerning this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson, came down to meet the king. From the day the king had left until the day he safely returned, Mephibosheth had not cared for his feet nor trimmed his mustache nor washed his clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, "Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He replied, "My lord the king, my servant deceived me! I said, 'Let me get my donkey saddled so that I can ride on it and go with the king,' for I am lame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But my servant has slandered me to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like an angel of God. Do whatever seems appropriate to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After all, there was no one in the entire house of my grandfather who did not deserve death from my lord the king. But instead you allowed me to eat at your own table! What further claim do I have to ask the king for anything?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then the king replied to him, "Why should you continue speaking like this? You and Ziba will inherit the field together."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let him have the whole thing! My lord the king has returned safely to his house!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now when Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim, he crossed the Jordan with the king so he could send him on his way from there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But Barzillai was very old - eighty years old, in fact - and he had taken care of the king when he stayed in Mahanaim, for he was a very rich man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So the king said to Barzillai, "Cross over with me, and I will take care of you while you are with me in Jerusalem."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Barzillai replied to the king, "How many days do I have left to my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I am presently eighty years old. Am I able to discern good and bad? Can I taste what I eat and drink? Am I still able to hear the voices of male and female singers? Why should I continue to be a burden to my lord the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">I will cross the Jordan with the king and go a short distance. Why should the king reward me in this way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Let me return so that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. But look, here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever seems appropriate to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The king replied, "Kimham will cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever I deem appropriate. And whatever you choose, I will do for you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">So all the people crossed the Jordan, as did the king. After the king had kissed him and blessed him, Barzillai returned to his home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham crossed over with him. Now all the soldiers of Judah along with half of the soldiers of Israel had helped the king cross over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then all the men of Israel began coming to the king. They asked the king, "Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, sneak the king away and help the king and his household cross the Jordan - and not only him but all of David's men as well?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">All the men of Judah replied to the men of Israel, "Because the king is our close relative! Why are you so upset about this? Have we eaten at the king's expense? Or have we misappropriated anything for our own use?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The men of Israel replied to the men of Judah, "We have ten shares in the king, and we have a greater claim on David than you do! Why do you want to curse us? Weren't we the first to suggest bringing back our king?" But the comments of the men of Judah were more severe than those of the men of Israel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now a wicked man named Sheba son of Bicri, a Benjaminite, happened to be there. He blew the trumpet and said,"We have no share in David; we have no inheritance in this son of Jesse! Every man go home, O Israel!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba son of Bicri. But the men of Judah stuck by their king all the way from the Jordan River to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then David went to his palace in Jerusalem. The king took the ten concubines he had left to care for the palace and placed them under confinement. Though he provided for their needs, he did not have sexual relations with them. They remained in confinement until the day they died, living out the rest of their lives as widows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the king said to Amasa, "Call the men of Judah together for me in three days, and you be present here with them too."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Amasa went out to call Judah together. But in doing so he took longer than the time that the king had allotted him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba son of Bicri will cause greater disaster for us than Absalom did! Take your lord's servants and pursue him. Otherwise he will secure fortified cities for himself and get away from us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Joab's men, accompanied by the Kerethites, the Pelethites, and all the warriors, left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When they were near the big rock that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to them. Now Joab was dressed in military attire and had a dagger in its sheath belted to his waist. When he advanced, it fell out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Joab said to Amasa, "How are you, my brother?" With his right hand Joab took hold of Amasa's beard as if to greet him with a kiss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Amasa did not protect himself from the knife in Joab's other hand, and Joab stabbed him in the abdomen, causing Amasa's intestines to spill out on the ground. There was no need to stab him again; the first blow was fatal. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bicri.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">One of Joab's soldiers who stood over Amasa said, "Whoever is for Joab and whoever is for David, follow Joab!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Amasa was squirming in his own blood in the middle of the path, and this man had noticed that all the soldiers stopped. Having noticed that everyone who came across Amasa stopped, the man pulled him away from the path and into the field and threw a garment over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Once he had removed Amasa from the path, everyone followed Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Sheba traveled through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth Maacah and all the Berite region. When they had assembled, they too joined him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So Joab's men came and laid siege against him in Abel of Beth Maacah. They prepared a siege ramp outside the city which stood against its outer rampart. As all of Joab's soldiers were trying to break through the wall so that it would collapse,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">a wise woman called out from the city, "Listen up! Listen up! Tell Joab, 'Come near so that I may speak to you.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When he approached her, the woman asked, "Are you Joab?" He replied, "I am." She said to him, "Listen to the words of your servant." He said, "Go ahead. I'm listening."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She said, "In the past they would always say, 'Let them inquire in Abel,' and that is how they settled things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I represent the peaceful and the faithful in Israel. You are attempting to destroy an important city in Israel. Why should you swallow up the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s inheritance?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Joab answered, "Get serious! I don't want to swallow up or destroy anything!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">That's not the way things are. There is a man from the hill country of Ephraim named Sheba son of Bicri. He has rebelled against King David. Give me just this one man, and I will leave the city." The woman said to Joab, "This very minute his head will be thrown over the wall to you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice and they cut off Sheba's head and threw it out to Joab. Joab blew the trumpet, and his men dispersed from the city, each going to his own home. Joab returned to the king in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now Joab was the general in command of all the army of Israel. Benaiah the son of Jehoida was over the Kerethites and the Perethites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Adoniram was supervisor of the work crews. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the secretary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Sheva was the scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">During David's reign there was a famine for three consecutive years. So David inquired of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "It is because of Saul and his bloodstained family, because he murdered the Gibeonites."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So the king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke with them. (Now the Gibeonites were not descendants of Israel; they were a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had made a promise to them, but Saul tried to kill them because of his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">David said to the Gibeonites, "What can I do for you, and how can I make amends so that you will bless the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s inheritance?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The Gibeonites said to him, "We have no claim to silver or gold from Saul or from his family, nor would we be justified in putting to death anyone in Israel." David asked, "What then are you asking me to do for you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They replied to the king, "As for this man who exterminated us and who schemed against us so that we were destroyed and left without status throughout all the borders of Israel -</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">The king had mercy on Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, in light of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s oath that had been taken between David and Jonathan son of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah's daughter Rizpah whom she had born to Saul, and the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab whom she had born to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He turned them over to the Gibeonites, and they executed them on a hill before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. The seven of them died together; they were put to death during harvest time - during the first days of the beginning of the barley harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest until the rain fell on them, she did not allow the birds of the air to feed on them by day, nor the wild animals by night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When David was told what Rizpah daughter of Aiah, Saul's concubine, had done,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">But the king's edict stood, despite the objections of Joab and the leaders of the army. So Joab and the leaders of the army left the king's presence in order to muster the Israelite army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They crossed the Jordan and camped at Aroer, on the south side of the city, at the wadi of Gad, near Jazer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then they went on to Gilead and to the region of Tahtim Hodshi, coming to Dan Jaan and on around to Sidon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">They went through all the land and after nine months and twenty days came back to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Joab reported the number of warriors to the king. In Israel there were 800,000 sword-wielding warriors, and in Judah there were 500,000 soldiers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">David felt guilty after he had numbered the army. David said to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "I have sinned greatly by doing this!

      <VERS vnumber="11">When David got up the next morning, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had already spoken to Gad the prophet, David's seer:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Gad went to David and told him, "Shall seven years of famine come upon your land? Or shall you flee for three months from your enemy with him in hot pursuit? Or shall there be three days of plague in your land? Now decide what I should tell the one who sent me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">David said to Gad, "I am very upset! I prefer that we be attacked by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, for his mercy is great; I do not want to be attacked by men!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> sent a plague through Israel from the morning until the completion of the appointed time. Seventy thousand men died from Dan to Beer Sheba.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">When he saw the angel who was destroying the people, David said to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "Look, it is I who have sinned and done this evil thing! As for these sheep - what have they done? Attack me and my family."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Araunah told David, "My lord the king may take whatever he wishes and offer it. Look! Here are oxen for burnt offerings, and threshing sledges and harnesses for wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I, the servant of my lord the king, give it all to the king!" Araunah also told the king, "May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God show you favor!"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">So they looked through all Israel for a beautiful young woman and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The young woman was very beautiful; she became the king's nurse and served him, but the king did not have sexual relations with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Adonijah, son of David and Haggith, was promoting himself, boasting, "I will be king!" He managed to acquire chariots and horsemen, as well as fifty men to serve as his royal guard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">(Now his father had never corrected him by saying, "Why do you do such things?" He was also very handsome and had been born right after Absalom. )</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">All the people followed him up, playing flutes and celebrating so loudly they made the ground shake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now Adonijah and all his guests heard the commotion just as they had finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he asked, "Why is there such a noisy commotion in the city?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">As he was still speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, "Come in, for an important man like you must be bringing good news."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Jonathan replied to Adonijah: "No! Our master King David has made Solomon king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The king sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites and they put him on the king's mule.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him king in Gihon. They went up from there rejoicing, and the city is in an uproar. That is the sound you hear.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="47">The king's servants have even come to congratulate our master King David, saying, 'May your God make Solomon more famous than you and make him an even greater king than you!'  Then the king leaned on the bed</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">"You know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me - how he murdered two commanders of the Israelite armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. During peacetime he struck them down like he would in battle; when he shed their blood as if in battle, he stained his own belt and the sandals on his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Do to him what you think is appropriate, but don't let him live long and die a peaceful death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"Treat fairly the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and provide for their needs, because they helped me when I had to flee from your brother Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"Note well, you still have to contend with Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, who tried to call down upon me a horrible judgment when I went to Mahanaim. He came down and met me at the Jordan, and I solemnly promised him by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, 'I will not strike you down with the sword.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But now don't treat him as if he were innocent. You are a wise man and you know how to handle him; make sure he has a bloody death."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then David passed away and was buried in the city of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">David reigned over Israel forty years; he reigned in Hebron seven years, and in Jerusalem thirty-three years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Solomon sat on his father David's throne, and his royal authority was firmly solidified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Haggith's son Adonijah visited Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. She asked, "Do you come in peace?" He answered, "Yes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He added, "I have something to say to you." She replied, "Speak."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said, "You know that the kingdom was mine and all Israel considered me king. But then the kingdom was given to my brother, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> decided it should be his.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">So Bathsheba visited King Solomon to speak to him on Adonijah's behalf. The king got up to greet her, bowed to her, and then sat on his throne. He ordered a throne to be brought for the king's mother, and she sat at his right hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">She said, "I would like to ask you for just one small favor. Please don't refuse me." He said, "Go ahead and ask, my mother, for I would not refuse you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She said, "Allow Abishag the Shunammite to be given to your brother Adonijah as a wife."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">King Solomon answered his mother, "Why just request Abishag the Shunammite for him? Since he is my older brother, you should also request the kingdom for him, for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab son of Zeruiah!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">King Solomon then swore an oath by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "May God judge me severely, if Adonijah does not pay for this request with his life!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now, as certainly as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives (he who made me secure, allowed me to sit on my father David's throne, and established a dynasty for me as he promised), Adonijah will be executed today!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">King Solomon then sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he killed Adonijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king then told Abiathar the priest, "Go back to your property in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but today I will not kill you because you did carry the ark of the sovereign <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> before my father David and you suffered with my father through all his difficult times."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Solomon dismissed Abiathar from his position as priest of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, fulfilling the decree of judgment the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> made in Shiloh against the family of Eli.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When the news reached Joab (for Joab had supported Adonijah, although he had not supported Absalom), he ran to the tent of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When King Solomon heard that Joab had run to the tent of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and was right there beside the altar, he ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, "Go, strike him down."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When Benaiah arrived at the tent of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, he said to him, "The king says, 'Come out!'" But he replied, "No, I will die here!" So Benaiah sent word to the king and reported Joab's reply.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The king told him, "Do as he said! Strike him down and bury him. Take away from me and from my father's family the guilt of Joab's murderous, bloody deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> punish him for the blood he shed; behind my father David's back he struck down and murdered with the sword two men who were more innocent and morally upright than he - Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">May Joab and his descendants be perpetually guilty of their shed blood, but may the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> give perpetual peace to David, his descendants, his family, and his dynasty."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and executed Joab; he was buried at his home in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada to take his place at the head of the army, and the king appointed Zadok the priest to take Abiathar's place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Next the king summoned Shimei and told him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there - but you may not leave there to go anywhere!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">So Shimei got up, saddled his donkey, and went to Achish at Gath to find his servants; Shimei went and brought back his servants from Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had then returned,</VERS>

You said to me, 'The proposal is acceptable; I agree to it.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Why then have you broken the oath you made before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and disobeyed the order I gave you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then the king said to Shimei, "You are well aware of the way you mistreated my father David. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will punish you for what you did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But King Solomon will be empowered and David's dynasty will endure permanently before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">The Lord was pleased that Solomon made this request.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God said to him, "Because you asked for the ability to make wise judicial decisions, and not for long life, or riches, or vengeance on your enemies,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Solomon then woke up and realized it was a dream. He went to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord's covenant, offered up burnt sacrifices, presented peace offerings, and held a feast for all his servants.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">Each stand had four supports, one per side projecting out from the stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">On top of each stand was a round opening three-quarters of a foot deep; there were also supports and frames on top of the stands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He engraved ornamental cherubs, lions, and palm trees on the plates of the supports and frames wherever there was room, with wreaths all around.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He made the ten stands in this way. All of them were cast in one mold and were identical in measurements and shape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He also made ten bronze basins, each of which could hold about 240 gallons. Each basin was six feet in diameter; there was one basin for each stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He put five basins on the south side of the temple and five on the north side. He put "The Sea" on the south side, in the southeast corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Hiram also made basins, shovels, and bowls. He finished all the work on the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple he had been assigned by King Solomon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="46">The king had them cast in earth foundries in the region of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Solomon left all these items unweighed; there were so many of them they did not weigh the bronze.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Just then a prophet from Judah, sent by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, arrived in Bethel, as Jeroboam was standing near the altar ready to offer a sacrifice.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">That day he also announced a sign, "This is the sign the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has predetermined: The altar will be split open and the ashes on it will fall to the ground."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the king heard what the prophet cried out against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam, standing at the altar, extended his hand and ordered, "Seize him!" The hand he had extended shriveled up and he could not pull it back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The altar split open and the ashes fell from the altar to the ground, in fulfillment of the sign the prophet had announced with the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s authority.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The king pled with the prophet, "Seek the favor of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God and pray for me, so that my hand may be restored." So the prophet sought the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s favor and the king's hand was restored to its former condition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The king then said to the prophet, "Come home with me and have something to eat. I'd like to give a present."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">Elijah then told all the people, "Approach me." So all the people approached him. He repaired the altar of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> that had been torn down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Elijah took twelve stones, corresponding to the number of tribes that descended from Jacob, to whom the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had said, "Israel will be your new name."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">With the stones he constructed an altar for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. Around the altar he made a trench large enough to contain two seahs of seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He arranged the wood, cut up the bull, and placed it on the wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then he said, "Fill four water jars and pour the water on the offering and the wood." When they had done so, he said, "Do it again." So they did it again. Then he said, "Do it a third time." So they did it a third time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The water flowed down all sides of the altar and filled the trench.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">When it was time for the evening offering, Elijah the prophet approached the altar and prayed: "O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, prove today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Answer me, O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, answer me, so these people will know that you, O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, are the true God and that you are winning back their allegiance."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then fire from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> fell from the sky. It consumed the offering, the wood, the stones, and the dirt, and licked up the water in the trench.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When all the people saw this, they threw themselves down with their faces to the ground and said, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is the true God! The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is the true God!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Elijah told them, "Seize the prophets of Baal! Don't let even one of them escape!" So they seized them, and Elijah led them down to the Kishon Valley and executed them there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then Elijah told Ahab, "Go on up and eat and drink, for the sound of a heavy rainstorm can be heard."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So Ahab went on up to eat and drink, while Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel. He bent down toward the ground and put his face between his knees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He told his servant, "Go on up and look in the direction of the sea." So he went on up, looked, and reported, "There is nothing." Seven times Elijah sent him to look.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The seventh time the servant said, "Look, a small cloud, the size of the palm of a man's hand, is rising up from the sea." Elijah then said, "Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up the chariots and go down, so that the rain won't overtake you.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Meanwhile the sky was covered with dark clouds, the wind blew, and there was a heavy rainstorm. Ahab rode toward Jezreel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Now the LORD energized Elijah with power; he tucked his robe into his belt and ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, including a detailed account of how he killed all the prophets with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah with this warning, "May the gods judge me severely if by this time tomorrow I do not take your life as you did theirs!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Elijah was afraid, so he got up and fled for his life to Beer Sheba in Judah. He left his servant there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">while he went a day's journey into the desert. He went and sat down under a shrub and asked the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> to take his life: "I've had enough! Now, O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, take my life. After all, I'm no better than my ancestors."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He stretched out and fell asleep under the shrub. All of a sudden an angelic messenger touched him and said, "Get up and eat."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He looked and right there by his head was a cake baking on hot coals and a jug of water. He ate and drank and then slept some more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s angelic messenger came back again, touched him, and said, "Get up and eat, for otherwise you won't be able to make the journey."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So he got up and ate and drank. That meal gave him the strength to travel forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He went into a cave there and spent the night. All of a sudden the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to him, "Why are you here, Elijah?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He answered, "I have been absolutely loyal to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, the sovereign God, even though the Israelites have abandoned the agreement they made with you, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword.

      <VERS vnumber="11">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "Go out and stand on the mountain before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.

After the windstorm there was an earthquake, but the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was not in the earthquake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After the earthquake, there was a fire, but the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was not in the fire. After the fire, there was a soft whisper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his robe and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave. All of a sudden a voice asked him, "Why are you here, Elijah?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He answered, "I have been absolutely loyal to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, the sovereign God, even though the Israelites have abandoned the agreement they made with you, torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword.

      <VERS vnumber="15">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to him, "Go back the way you came and then head for the Desert of Damascus. Go and anoint Hazael king over Syria.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">I still have left in Israel seven thousand followers who have not bowed their knees to Baal or kissed the images of him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve pairs of oxen; he was near the twelfth pair. Elijah passed by him and threw his robe over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, "Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye, then I will follow you." Elijah said to him, "Go back! Indeed, what have I done to you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Elisha went back and took his pair of oxen and slaughtered them. He cooked the meat over a fire that he made by burning the harness and yoke. He gave the people meat and they ate. Then he got up and followed Elijah and became his assistant.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now King Ben Hadad of Syria assembled all his army, along with thirty-two other kings with their horses and chariots. He marched against Samaria and besieged and attacked it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He sent messengers to King Ahab of Israel, who was in the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said to him, "This is what Ben Hadad says, 'Your silver and your gold are mine, as well as the best of your wives and sons.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The king of Israel replied, "It is just as you say, my master, O king. I and all I own belong to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The messengers came again and said, "This is what Ben Hadad says, 'I sent this message to you, "You must give me your silver, gold, wives, and sons."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now at this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you and they will search through your palace and your servants' houses. They will carry away all your valuables."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The king of Israel summoned all the leaders of the land and said, "Notice how this man is looking for trouble. Indeed, he demanded my wives, sons, silver, and gold, and I did not resist him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All the leaders and people said to him, "Do not give in or agree to his demands."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, "Say this to my master, the king, 'I will give you everything you demanded at first from your servant, but I am unable to agree to this latest demand.'" So the messengers went back and gave their report.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Ben Hadad sent another message to him, "May the gods judge me severely if there is enough dirt left in Samaria for my soldiers to scoop up in their hands."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The king of Israel replied, "Tell him the one who puts on his battle gear should not boast like one who is taking it off."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When Ben Hadad received this reply, he and the other kings were drinking in their quarters. He ordered his servants, "Get ready to attack!" So they got ready to attack the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now a prophet visited King Ahab of Israel and said, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'Do you see this huge army? Look, I am going to hand it over to you this very day. Then you will know that I am the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Ahab asked, "By whom will this be accomplished?" He answered, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'By the servants of the district governors.'" Ahab asked, "Who will launch the attack?" He answered, "You will."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So Ahab assembled the 232 servants of the district governors. After that he assembled all the Israelite army, numbering 7,000.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They marched out at noon, while Ben Hadad and the thirty-two kings allied with him were drinking heavily in their quarters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The servants of the district governors led the march. When Ben Hadad sent messengers, they reported back to him, "Men are marching out of Samaria."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He ordered, "Whether they come in peace or to do battle, take them alive."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They marched out of the city with the servants of the district governors in the lead and the army behind them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Each one struck down an enemy soldier; the Syrians fled and Israel chased them. King Ben Hadad of Syria escaped on horseback with some horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then the king of Israel marched out and struck down the horses and chariots; he thoroughly defeated Syria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The prophet visited the king of Israel and instructed him, "Go, fortify your defenses. Determine what you must do, for in the spring the king of Syria will attack you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now the advisers of the king of Syria said to him: "Their God is a god of the mountains. That's why they overpowered us. But if we fight them in the plains, we will certainly overpower them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So do this: Dismiss the kings from their command, and replace them with military commanders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Muster an army like the one you lost, with the same number of horses and chariots. Then we will fight them in the plains; we will certainly overpower them." He approved their plan and did as they advised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">In the spring Ben Hadad mustered the Syrian army and marched to Aphek to fight Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When the Israelites had mustered and had received their supplies, they marched out to face them in battle. When the Israelites deployed opposite them, they were like two small flocks of goats, but the Syrians filled the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The prophet visited the king of Israel and said, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says: 'Because the Syrians said, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys," I will hand over to you this entire huge army.

      <VERS vnumber="29">The armies were deployed opposite each other for seven days. On the seventh day the battle began, and the Israelites killed 100,000 Syrian foot soldiers in one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The remaining 27,000 ran to Aphek and went into the city, but the wall fell on them. Now Ben Hadad ran into the city and hid in an inner room.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">His advisers said to him, "Look, we have heard that the kings of the Israelite dynasty are kind. Allow us to put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads and surrender to the king of Israel. Maybe he will spare our lives."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So they put sackcloth around their waists and ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel. They said, "Your servant Ben Hadad says, 'Please let me live!'" Ahab replied, "Is he still alive? He is my brother."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The men took this as a good omen and quickly accepted his offer, saying, "Ben Hadad is your brother." Ahab then said, "Go, get him." So Ben Hadad came out to him, and Ahab pulled him up into his chariot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Ben Hadad said, "I will return the cities my father took from your father. You may set up markets in Damascus, just as my father did in Samaria." Ahab then said, "I want to make a treaty with you before I dismiss you." So he made a treaty with him and then dismissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">One of the members of the prophetic guild, speaking with divine authority, ordered his companion, "Wound me!" But the man refused to wound him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">So the prophet said to him, "Because you have disobeyed the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you." When he left him, a lion attacked and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He found another man and said, "Wound me!" So the man wounded him severely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The prophet then went and stood by the road, waiting for the king. He also disguised himself by putting a bandage down over his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When the king passed by, he called out to the king, "Your servant went out into the heat of the battle, and then a man turned aside and brought me a prisoner. He told me, 'Guard this prisoner. If he ends up missing for any reason, you will pay with your life or with a talent of silver.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Well, it just so happened that while your servant was doing this and that, he disappeared." The king of Israel said to him, "Your punishment is already determined by your own testimony."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The prophet quickly removed the bandage from his eyes and the king of Israel recognized he was one of the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The prophet then said to him, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'Because you released a man I had determined should die, you will pay with your life and your people will suffer instead of his people.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The king of Israel went home to Samaria bitter and angry.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this the following episode took place. Naboth the Jezreelite owned a vineyard in Jezreel adjacent to the palace of King Ahab of Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ahab said to Naboth, "Give me your vineyard so I can make a vegetable garden out of it, for it is adjacent to my palace. I will give you an even better vineyard in its place, or if you prefer, I will pay you silver for it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Naboth replied to Ahab, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> forbid that I should sell you my ancestral inheritance."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So Ahab went into his palace, bitter and angry that Naboth the Jezreelite had said, "I will not sell to you my ancestral inheritance." He lay down on his bed, pouted, and would not eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then his wife Jezebel came in and said to him, "Why do you have a bitter attitude and refuse to eat?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He answered her, "While I was talking to Naboth the Jezreelite, I said to him, 'Sell me your vineyard for silver, or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.' But he said, 'I will not sell you my vineyard.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">His wife Jezebel said to him, "You are the king of Israel! Get up, eat some food, and have a good time. I will get the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite for you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">She wrote out orders, signed Ahab's name to them, and sealed them with his seal. She then sent the orders to the leaders and to the nobles who lived in Naboth's city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This is what she wrote: "Observe a time of fasting and seat Naboth in front of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Also seat two villains opposite him and have them testify, 'You cursed God and the king.' Then take him out and stone him to death."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The men of the city, the leaders and the nobles who lived there, followed the written orders Jezebel had sent them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They observed a time of fasting and put Naboth in front of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The two villains arrived and sat opposite him. Then the villains testified against Naboth right before the people, saying, "Naboth cursed God and the king." So they dragged him outside the city and stoned him to death.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, "Get up, take possession of the vineyard Naboth the Jezreelite refused to sell you for silver, for Naboth is no longer alive; he's dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> told Elijah the Tishbite:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah attacked Ramoth Gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and then enter into the battle; but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and then entered into the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now the king of Syria had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, "Do not fight common soldiers or high-ranking officers; fight only the king of Israel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "He must be the king of Israel." So they turned and attacked him, but Jehoshaphat cried out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they turned away from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Now an archer shot an arrow at random, and it struck the king of Israel between the plates of his armor. The king ordered his charioteer, "Turn around and take me from the battle line, because I'm wounded."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">While the battle raged throughout the day, the king stood propped up in his chariot opposite the Syrians. He died in the evening; the blood from the wound ran down into the bottom of the chariot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">As the sun was setting, a cry went through the camp, "Each one should return to his city and to his homeland."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So the king died and was taken to Samaria, where they buried him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">They washed off the chariot at the pool of Samaria (this was where the prostitutes bathed); dogs licked his blood, just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had said would happen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">In the fourth year of King Ahab's reign over Israel, Asa's son Jehoshaphat became king over Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king and he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He followed in his father Asa's footsteps and was careful to do what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> approved. However, the high places were not eliminated; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat's reign, including his successes and military exploits, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He removed from the land any male cultic prostitutes who had managed to survive the reign of his father Asa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">There was no king in Edom at this time; a governor ruled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Jehoshaphat built a fleet of large merchant ships to travel to Ophir for gold, but they never made the voyage because they were shipwrecked in Ezion Geber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Then Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my sailors join yours in the fleet," but Jehoshaphat refused.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jehoshaphat passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the city of his ancestor David. His son Jehoram replaced him as king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">In the seventeenth year of King Jehoshaphat's reign over Judah, Ahab's son Ahaziah became king over Israel in Samaria. He ruled for two years over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">He did evil in the sight of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and followed in the footsteps of his father and mother; like Jeroboam son of Nebat, he encouraged Israel to sin.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After Ahab died, Moab rebelled against Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ahaziah fell through a window lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria and was injured. He sent messengers with these orders, "Go, ask Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, if I will survive this injury."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s angelic messenger told Elijah the Tishbite, "Get up, go to meet the messengers from the king of Samaria. Say this to them: 'You must think there is no God in Israel! That explains why you are on your way to seek an oracle from Baal Zebub the god of Ekron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore this is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, "You will not leave the bed you lie on, for you will certainly die!"'" So Elijah went on his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, "Why have you returned?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They replied, "A man came up to meet us. He told us, "Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, 'This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says: "You must think there is no God in Israel! That explains why you are sending for an oracle from Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron. Therefore you will not leave the bed you lie on, for you will certainly die."'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The king asked them, "Describe the appearance of this man who came up to meet you and told you these things."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They replied, "He was a hairy man and had a leather belt tied around his waist." The king said, "He is Elijah the Tishbite."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The king sent a captain and his fifty soldiers to retrieve Elijah. The captain went up to him, while he was sitting on the top of a hill. He told him, "Prophet, the king says, 'Come down!'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Elijah replied to the captain, "If I am indeed a prophet, may fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty soldiers!" Fire then came down from the sky and consumed him and his fifty soldiers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The king sent another captain and his fifty soldiers to retrieve Elijah. He went up and told him, "Prophet, this is what the king says, 'Come down at once!'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Elijah replied to them, "If I am indeed a prophet, may fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty soldiers!" Fire from God came down from the sky and consumed him and his fifty soldiers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The king sent a third captain and his fifty soldiers. This third captain went up and fell  on his knees before Elijah. He begged for mercy, "Prophet, please have respect for my life and for the lives of these fifty servants of yours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Indeed, fire came down from the sky and consumed the two captains who came before me, along with their men. So now, please have respect for my life."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s angelic messenger said to Elijah, "Go down with him. Don't be afraid of him." So he got up and went down with him to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Elijah said to the king, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'You sent messengers to seek an oracle from Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron. You must think there is no God in Israel from whom you can seek an oracle! Therefore you will not leave the bed you lie on, for you will certainly die.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He died just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had prophesied through Elijah. In the second year of the reign of King Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat over Judah, Ahaziah's brother Jehoram replaced him as king of Israel, because he had no son.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Just before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> took Elijah up to heaven in a windstorm, Elijah and Elisha were traveling from Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Elijah told Elisha, "Stay here, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has sent me to Bethel." But Elisha said, "As certainly as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Some members of the prophetic guild in Bethel came out to Elisha and said, "Do you know that today the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is going to take your master from you?" He answered, "Yes, I know. Be quiet."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Elijah said to him, "Elisha, stay here, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has sent me to Jericho." But he replied, "As certainly as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went to Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Some members of the prophetic guild in Jericho approached Elisha and said, "Do you know that today the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is going to take your master from you?" He answered, "Yes, I know. Be quiet."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Elijah said to him, "Stay here, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has sent me to the Jordan." But he replied, "As certainly as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they traveled on together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The fifty members of the prophetic guild went and stood opposite them at a distance, while Elijah and Elisha stood by the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Elijah took his cloak, folded it up, and hit the water with it. The water divided, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, "What can I do for you, before I am taken away from you?" Elisha answered, "May I receive a double portion of the prophetic spirit that energizes you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Elijah replied, "That's a difficult request! If you see me taken from you, may it be so, but if you don't, it will not happen."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As they were walking along and talking, suddenly a fiery chariot pulled by fiery horses appeared. They went between Elijah and Elisha, and Elijah went up to heaven in a windstorm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">While Elisha was watching, he was crying out, "My father, my father! The chariot and horsemen of Israel!" Then he could no longer see him. He grabbed his clothes and tore them in two.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He picked up Elijah's cloak, which had fallen off him, and went back and stood on the shore of the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He took the cloak that had fallen off Elijah, hit the water with it, and said, "Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?" When he hit the water, it divided and Elisha crossed over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When the members of the prophetic guild in Jericho, who were standing at a distance, saw him do this, they said, "The spirit that energized Elijah rests upon Elisha." They went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They said to him, "Look, there are fifty capable men with your servants. Let them go and look for your master, for the wind sent from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> may have carried him away and dropped him on one of the hills or in one of the valleys." But Elisha replied, "Don't send them out."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But they were so insistent, he became embarrassed. So he said, "Send them out." They sent the fifty men out and they looked for three days, but could not find Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they came back, Elisha was staying in Jericho. He said to them, "Didn't I tell you, 'Don't go'?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The men of the city said to Elisha, "Look, the city has a good location, as our master can see. But the water is bad and the land doesn't produce crops."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Elisha said, "Get me a new jar and put some salt in it." So they got it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He went out to the spring and threw the salt in. Then he said, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'I have purified this water. It will no longer cause death or fail to produce crops."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The water has been pure to this very day, just as Elisha prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He went up from there to Bethel. As he was traveling up the road, some young boys came out of the city and made fun of him, saying, "Go on up, baldy! Go on up, baldy!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When he turned around and saw them, he called God's judgment down on them. Two female bears came out of the woods and ripped forty-two of the boys to pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">From there he traveled to Mount Carmel and then back to Samaria.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the eighteenth year of King Jehoshaphat's reign over Judah, Ahab's son Jehoram became king over Israel in Samaria; he ruled for twelve years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He did evil in the sight of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, but not to the same degree as his father and mother. He did remove the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yet he persisted in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who encouraged Israel to sin; he did not turn from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now King Mesha of Moab was a sheep breeder. He would send as tribute to the king of Israel 100,000 male lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">At that time King Jehoram left Samaria and assembled all Israel for war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you fight with me against Moab?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I will join you in the campaign; my army and horses are at your disposal."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He then asked, "Which invasion route are we going to take?" Jehoram answered, "By the road through the Desert of Edom."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom set out together. They wandered around on the road for seven days and finally ran out of water for the men and animals they had with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The king of Israel said, "Oh no! Certainly the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has summoned these three kings so that he can hand them over to the king of Moab!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no prophet of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> here that we might seek the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s direction?" One of the servants of the king of Israel answered, "Elisha son of Shapat is here; he used to be Elijah's servant."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jehoshaphat said, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> speaks through him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to visit him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Elisha said to the king of Israel, "Why are you here? Go to your father's prophets or your mother's prophets!" The king of Israel replied to him, "No, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is the one who summoned these three kings so that he can hand them over to Moab."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Elisha said, "As certainly as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who rules over all lives (whom I serve), if I did not respect King Jehoshaphat of Judah, I would not pay attention to you or acknowledge you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But now, get me a musician." When the musician played, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> energized him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and he said, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'Make many cisterns in this valley,'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for this is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'You will not feel any wind or see any rain, but this valley will be full of water and you and your cattle and animals will drink.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This is an easy task for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>; he will also hand Moab over to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You will defeat every fortified city and every important city. You must chop down every productive tree, stop up all the springs, and cover all the cultivated land with stones."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Sure enough, the next morning, at the time of the morning sacrifice, water came flowing down from Edom and filled the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now all Moab had heard that the kings were attacking, so everyone old enough to fight was mustered and placed at the border.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When they got up early the next morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites, who were some distance away, the water looked red like blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The Moabites said, "It's blood! The kings are totally destroyed! They have struck one another down! Now, Moab, seize the plunder!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When they approached the Israelite camp, the Israelites rose up and struck down the Moabites, who then ran from them. The Israelites thoroughly defeated Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They tore down the cities and each man threw a stone into every cultivated field until they were covered. They stopped up every spring and chopped down every productive tree.Only Kir Hareseth was left intact, but the slingers surrounded it and attacked it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the king of Moab realized he was losing the battle, he and 700 swordsmen tried to break through and attack the king of Edom, but they failed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice on the wall. There was an outburst of divine anger against Israel, so they broke off the attack and returned to their homeland.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now a wife of one of the prophets appealed to Elisha for help, saying, "Your servant, my husband is dead. You know that your servant was a loyal follower of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. Now the creditor is coming to take away my two boys to be his servants."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Elisha said to her, "What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?" She answered, "Your servant has nothing in the house except a small jar of olive oil."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said, "Go and ask all your neighbors for empty containers. Get as many as you can.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Go and close the door behind you and your sons. Pour the olive oil into all the containers; set aside each one when you have filled it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So she left him and closed the door behind her and her sons. As they were bringing the containers to her, she was pouring the olive oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the containers were full, she said to one of her sons, "Bring me another container." But he answered her, "There are no more." Then the olive oil stopped flowing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">She went and told the prophet. He said, "Go, sell the olive oil. Repay your creditor, and then you and your sons can live off the rest of the profit."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">One day Elisha traveled to Shunem, where a prominent woman lived. She insisted that he stop for a meal. So whenever he was passing through, he would stop in there for a meal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">She said to her husband, "Look, I'm sure that the man who regularly passes through here is a very special prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Let's make a small private upper room and furnish it with a bed, table, chair, and lamp. When he visits us, he can stay there."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">One day Elisha came for a visit; he went into the upper room and rested.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He told his servant Gehazi, "Ask the Shunammite woman to come here." So he did so and she came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Elisha said to Gehazi, "Tell her, 'Look, you have treated us with such great respect. What can I do for you? Can I put in a good word for you with the king or the commander of the army?'" She replied, "I'm quite secure."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So he asked Gehazi, "What can I do for her?" Gehazi replied, "She has no son, and her husband is old."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Elisha told him, "Ask her to come here." So he did so and she came and stood in the doorway.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He said, "About this time next year you will be holding a son." She said, "No, my master! O prophet, do not lie to your servant!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The woman did conceive, and at the specified time the next year she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The boy grew and one day he went out to see his father who was with the harvest workers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He said to his father, "My head! My head!" His father told a servant, "Carry him to his mother."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So he picked him up and took him to his mother. He sat on her lap until noon and then died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She went up and laid him down on the prophet's bed. She shut the door behind her and left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">She called to her husband, "Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so I can go see the prophet quickly and then return."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, "Why do you want to go see him today? It is not the new moon or the Sabbath." She said, "Everything's fine."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">She saddled the donkey and told her servant, "Lead on. Do not stop unless I say so."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So she went to visit the prophet at Mount Carmel. When he saw her at a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi, "Look, it's the Shunammite woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now, run to meet her and ask her, 'Are you well? Are your husband and the boy well?'" She told Gehazi, "Everything's fine."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when she reached the prophet on the mountain, she grabbed hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to push her away, but the prophet said, "Leave her alone, for she is very upset. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has kept the matter hidden from me; he didn't tell me about it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">She said, "Did I ask my master for a son? Didn't I say, 'Don't mislead me?'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Elisha told Gehazi, "Tuck your robes into your belt, take my staff, and go! Don't stop to exchange greetings with anyone! Place my staff on the child's face."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The mother of the child said, "As certainly as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So Elisha got up and followed her back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now Gehazi went on ahead of them. He placed the staff on the child's face, but there was no sound or response. When he came back to Elisha he told him, "The child did not wake up."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">When Elisha arrived at the house, there was the child lying dead on his bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He went in by himself and closed the door. Then he prayed to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He got up on the bed and spread his body out over the boy; he put his mouth on the boy's mouth, his eyes over the boy's eyes, and the palms of his hands against the boy's palms. He bent down over him, and the boy's skin grew warm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Elisha went back and walked around in the house. Then he got up on the bed again and bent down over him. The child sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Elisha called to Gehazi and said, "Get the Shunammite woman." So he did so and she came to him. He said to her, "Take your son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">She came in, fell at his feet, and bowed down. Then she picked up her son and left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Now Elisha went back to Gilgal, while there was famine in the land. Some of the prophets were visiting him and he told his servant, "Put the big pot on the fire and boil some stew for the prophets."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Someone went out to the field to gather some herbs and found a wild vine. He picked some of its fruit, enough to fill up the fold of his robe. He came back, cut it up, and threw the slices into the stew pot, not knowing they were harmful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">The stew was poured out for the men to eat. When they ate some of the stew, they cried out, "Death is in the pot, O prophet!" They could not eat it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He said, "Get some flour." Then he threw it into the pot and said, "Now pour some out for the men so they may eat." There was no longer anything harmful in the pot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Now a man from Baal Shalisha brought some food for the prophet - twenty loaves of bread made from the firstfruits of the barley harvest, as well as fresh ears of grain. Elisha said, "Set it before the people so they may eat."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But his attendant said, "How can I feed a hundred men with this?" He replied, "Set it before the people so they may eat, for this is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'They will eat and have some left over.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">So he set it before them; they ate and had some left over, just as the LORD predicted.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Naaman, the commander of the king of Syria's army, was esteemed and respected by his master, for through him the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had given Syria military victories. But this great warrior had a skin disease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Raiding parties went out from Syria and took captive from the land of Israel a young girl, who became a servant to Naaman's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">She told her mistress, "If only my master were in the presence of the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his skin disease."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Naaman went and told his master what the girl from the land of Israel had said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king of Syria said, "Go! I will send a letter to the king of Israel." So Naaman went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten suits of clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He brought the letter to king of Israel. It read: "This is a letter of introduction for my servant Naaman, whom I have sent to be cured of his skin disease."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, "Am I God? Can I kill or restore life? Why does he ask me to cure a man of his skin disease? Certainly you must see that he is looking for an excuse to fight me!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Elisha the prophet heard that the king had torn his clothes, he sent this message to the king, "Why did you tear your clothes? Send him to me so he may know there is a prophet in Israel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood in the doorway of Elisha's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Elisha sent out a messenger who told him, "Go and wash seven times in the Jordan; your skin will be restored and you will be healed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Naaman went away angry. He said, "Look, I thought for sure he would come out, stand there, invoke the name of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> his God, wave his hand over the area, and cure the skin disease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The rivers of Damascus, the Abana and Pharpar, are better than any of the waters of Israel! Could I not wash in them and be healed?" So he turned around and went away angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">His servants approached and said to him, "O master, if the prophet had told you to do some difficult task, you would have been willing to do it. It seems you should be happy that he simply said, "Wash and you will be healed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So he went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times, as the prophet had instructed. His skin became as smooth as a young child's and he was healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He and his entire entourage returned to the prophet. Naaman came and stood before him. He said, "For sure I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel! Now, please accept a gift from your servant."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Elisha replied, "As certainly as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives (whom I serve), I will take nothing from you." Naaman insisted that he take it, but he refused.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Naaman said, "If not, then please give your servant a load of dirt, enough for a pair of mules to carry, for your servant will never again offer a burnt offering or sacrifice to a god other than the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> forgive your servant for this one thing: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to worship, and he leans on my arm and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> forgive your servant for this."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Elisha said to him, "Go in peace."When he had gone a short distance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Gehazi, the prophet Elisha's servant, thought, "Look, my master did not accept what this Syrian Naaman offered him. As certainly as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives, I will run after him and accept something from him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So Gehazi ran after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him and asked, "Is everything all right?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He answered, "Everything is fine. My master sent me with this message, 'Look, two servants of the prophets just arrived from the Ephraimite hill country. Please give them a talent of silver and two suits of clothes.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Naaman said, "Please accept two talents of silver. He insisted, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, along with two suits of clothes. He gave them to two of his servants and they carried them for Gehazi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When he arrived at the hill, he took them from the servants and put them in the house. Then he sent the men on their way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When he came and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, "Where have you been, Gehazi?" He answered, "Your servant hasn't been anywhere."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Elisha replied, "I was there in spirit when a man turned and got down from his chariot to meet you. This is not the proper time to accept silver or to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, sheep, cattle, and male and female servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore Naaman's skin disease will afflict you and your descendants forever!" When Gehazi went out from his presence, his skin was as white as snow.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Some of the prophets said to Elisha, "Look, the place where we meet with you is too cramped for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Let's go to the Jordan. Each of us will get a log from there and we will build a meeting place for ourselves there." He said, "Go."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">One of them said, "Please come along with your servants." He replied, "All right, I'll come."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So he went with them. When they arrived at the Jordan, they started cutting down trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As one of them was felling a log, the ax head dropped into the water. He shouted, "Oh no, my master! It was borrowed!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The prophet asked, "Where did it drop in?" When he showed him the spot, Elisha cut off a branch, threw it in at that spot, and made the ax head float.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He said, "Lift it out." So he reached out his hand and grabbed it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now the king of Syria was at war with Israel. He consulted his advisers, who said, "Invade at such and such a place."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But the prophet sent this message to the king of Israel, "Make sure you don't pass through this place because Syria is invading there."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the king of Israel sent a message to the place the prophet had pointed out, warning it to be on its guard. This happened on several occasions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This made the king of Syria upset. So he summoned his advisers and said to them, "One of us must be helping the king of Israel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">One of his advisers said, "No, my master, O king. The prophet Elisha who lives in Israel keeps telling the king of Israel the things you say in your bedroom."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The king ordered, "Go, find out where he is, so I can send some men to capture him." The king was told, "He is in Dothan."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So he sent horses and chariots there, along with a good-sized army. They arrived during the night and surrounded the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The prophet's attendant got up early in the morning. When he went outside there was an army surrounding the city, along with horses and chariots. He said to Elisha, "Oh no, my master! What will we do?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He replied, "Don't be afraid, for our side outnumbers them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Elisha prayed, "O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, open his eyes so he can see." The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> opened the servant's eyes and he saw that the hill was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As they approached him, Elisha prayed to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "Strike these people with blindness." The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> struck them with blindness as Elisha requested.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Elisha said to them, "This is not the right road or city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you're looking for." He led them to Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When they had entered Samaria, Elisha said, "O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, open their eyes, so they can see." The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> opened their eyes and they saw that they were in the middle of Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, "Should I strike them down, my master?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He replied, "Do not strike them down! You did not capture them with your sword or bow, so what gives you the right to strike them down? Give them some food and water, so they can eat and drink and then go back to their master."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So he threw a big banquet for them and they ate and drank. Then he sent them back to their master. After that no Syrian raiding parties again invaded the land of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Later King Ben Hadad of Syria assembled his entire army and attacked and besieged Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Samaria's food supply ran out. They laid siege to it so long that a donkey's head was selling for eighty shekels of silver and a quarter of a kab of dove's droppings for five shekels of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">While the king of Israel was passing by on the city wall, a woman shouted to him, "Help us, my master, O king!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He replied, "No, let the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> help you. How can I help you? The threshing floor and winepress are empty."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then the king asked her, "What's your problem?" She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Hand over your son; we'll eat him today and then eat my son tomorrow.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So we boiled my son and ate him. Then I said to her the next day, 'Hand over your son and we'll eat him.' But she hid her son!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When the king heard what the woman said, he tore his clothes. As he was passing by on the wall, the people could see he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then he said, "May God judge me severely if Elisha son of Shaphat still has his head by the end of the day!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now Elisha was sitting in his house with the community leaders. The king sent a messenger on ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the leaders, "Do you realize this assassin intends to cut off my head?" Look, when the messenger arrives, shut the door and lean against it. His master will certainly be right behind him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He was still talking to them when the messenger approached and said, "Look, the LORD is responsible for this disaster! Why should I continue to wait for the LORD to help?"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Elisha replied, "Hear the word of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>! This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'About this time tomorrow a seah of finely milled flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">An officer who was the king's right-hand man responded to the prophet, "Look, even if the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> made it rain by opening holes in the sky, could this happen so soon?" Elisha said, "Look, you will see it happen with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of the food!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now four men with a skin disease were sitting at the entrance of the city gate. They said to one another, "Why are we just sitting here waiting to die?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If we go into the city, we'll die of starvation, and if we stay here we'll die! So come on, let's defect to the Syrian camp! If they spare us, we'll live; if they kill us - well, we were going to die anyway."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So they started toward the Syrian camp at dusk. When they reached the edge of the Syrian camp, there was no one there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had caused the Syrian camp to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a large army. Then they said to one another, "Look, the king of Israel has paid the kings of the Hittites and Egypt to attack us!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So they got up and fled at dusk, leaving behind their tents, horses, and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When the men with a skin disease reached the edge of the camp, they entered a tent and had a meal. They also took some silver, gold, and clothes and went and hid it all. Then they went back and entered another tent. They looted it and went and hid what they had taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then they said to one another, "It's not right what we're doing! This is a day to celebrate, but we haven't told anyone. If we wait until dawn, we'll be punished. So come on, let's go and inform the royal palace."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the city. They told them, "We entered the Syrian camp and there was no one there. We didn't even hear a man's voice. But the horses and donkeys are still tied up, and the tents remain up."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The gatekeepers relayed the news to the royal palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The king got up in the night and said to his advisers, "I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know we are starving, so they left the camp and hid in the field, thinking, 'When they come out of the city, we will capture them alive and enter the city.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">One of his advisers replied, "Pick some men and have them take five of the horses that are left in the city. (Even if they are killed, their fate will be no different than that of all the Israelite people - we're all going to die!) Let's send them out so we can know for sure what's going on."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So they picked two horsemen and the king sent them out to track the Syrian army. He ordered them, "Go and find out what's going on."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they tracked them as far as the Jordan. The road was filled with clothes and equipment that the Syrians had discarded in their haste. The scouts went back and told the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the people went out and looted the Syrian camp. A seah of finely milled flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had said they would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the king had placed the officer who was his right-hand man at the city gate. When the people rushed out, they trampled him to death in the gate. This fulfilled the prophet's word which he had spoken when the king tried to arrest him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The prophet told the king, "Two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel, and a seah of finely milled flour for a shekel; this will happen about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But the officer replied to the prophet, "Look, even if the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> made it rain by opening holes in the sky, could this happen so soon?" Elisha said, "Look, you will see it happen with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of the food!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">This is exactly what happened to him. The people trampled him to death in the city gate.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Elisha advised the woman whose son he had brought back to life, "You and your family should go and live somewhere else for a while, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has decreed that a famine will overtake the land for seven years."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So the woman did as the prophet said. She and her family went and lived in the land of the Philistines for seven years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">After seven years the woman returned from the land of the Philistines and went to ask the king to give her back her house and field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the king was talking to Gehazi, the prophet's servant, and said, "Tell me all the great things which Elisha has done."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">While Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought the dead back to life, the woman whose son he had brought back to life came to ask the king for her house and field. Gehazi said, "My master, O king, this is the very woman and this is her son whom Elisha brought back to life!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The king asked the woman about it, and she gave him the details. The king assigned a eunuch to take care of her request and ordered him, "Give her back everything she owns, as well as the amount of crops her field produced from the day she left the land until now."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Elisha traveled to Damascus while King Ben Hadad of Syria was sick. The king was told, "The prophet has come here."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the king told Hazael, "Take a gift and go visit the prophet. Request from him an oracle from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. Ask him, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Hazael went to visit Elisha. He took along a gift, as well as forty camel loads of all the fine things of Damascus. When he arrived, he stood before him and said, "Your son, King Ben Hadad of Syria, has sent me to you with this question, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Elisha said to him, "Go and tell him, 'You will surely recover,' but the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has revealed to me that he will surely die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Elisha just stared at him until Hazael became uncomfortable. Then the prophet started crying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Hazael asked, "Why are you crying, my master?" He replied, "Because I know the trouble you will cause the Israelites. You will set fire to their fortresses, kill their young men with the sword, smash their children to bits, and rip open their pregnant women."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Hazael said, "How could your servant, who is as insignificant as a dog, accomplish this great military victory?" Elisha answered, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has revealed to me that you will be the king of Syria."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He left Elisha and went to his master. Ben Hadad asked him, "What did Elisha tell you?" Hazael replied, "He told me you would surely recover."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The next day Hazael took a piece of cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it over Ben Hadad's face until he died. Then Hazael replaced him as king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In the fifth year of the reign of Israel's King Joram, son of Ahab, Jehoshaphat's son Jehoram became king over Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He was thirty-two years old when he became king and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel, just as Ahab's dynasty had done, for he married Ahab's daughter. He did evil in the sight of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was unwilling to destroy Judah. He preserved Judah for the sake of his servant David to whom he had promised a perpetual dynasty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">During his reign Edom freed themselves from Judah's control and set up their own king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Joram crossed over to Zair with all his chariots. The Edomites, who had surrounded him, attacked at night and defeated him and his chariot officers. The Israelite army retreated to their homeland.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Edom has remained free from Judah's control to this very day. At that same time Libnah also rebelled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The rest of the events of Joram's reign, including a record of his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Joram passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David. His son Ahaziah replaced him as king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">In the twelfth year of the reign of Israel's King Joram, son of Ahab, Jehoram's son Ahaziah became king over Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, the granddaughter of King Omri of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He followed in the footsteps of Ahab's dynasty and did evil in the sight of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, like Ahab's dynasty, for he was related to Ahab's family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He joined Ahab's son Joram in a battle against King Hazael of Syria at Ramoth Gilead in which the Syrians defeated Joram.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received from the Syrians in Ramah when he fought against King Hazael of Syria. King Ahaziah son of Jehoram of Judah went down to visit Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, for he was ill.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Elisha the prophet summoned a member of the prophetic guild and told him, "Tuck your robes into your belt, take this container of olive oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Take the container of olive oil, pour it over his head, and say, 'This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, "I have designated you as king over Israel."' Then open the door and run away quickly!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So the young prophet went to Ramoth Gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When he arrived, the officers of the army were sitting there. So he said, "I have a message for you, O officer." Jehu asked, "For which one of us?" He replied, "For you, O officer."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Jehu got up and went inside. Then the prophet poured the olive oil on his head and said to him, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel says, 'I have designated you as king over the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You will destroy the family of your master Ahab. I will get revenge against Jezebel for the shed blood of my servants the prophets and for the shed blood of all the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s servants.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">When Jehu rejoined his master's servants, they asked him, "Is everything all right? Why did this madman visit you?" He replied, "Ah, it's not important. You know what kind of man he is and the kinds of things he says."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But they said, "You're lying! Tell us what he said." So he told them what he had said. He also related how he had said, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'I have designated you as king over Israel.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Each of them quickly took off his cloak and they spread them out at Jehu's feet on the steps. The trumpet was blown and they shouted, "Jehu is king!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi conspired against Joram.Now Joram had been in Ramoth Gilead with the whole Israelite army, guarding against an invasion by King Hazael of Syria.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">The watchman reported, "He reached them, but hasn't started back. The one who drives the lead chariot drives like Jehu son of Nimshi; he drives recklessly."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jehoram ordered, "Hitch up my chariot." When his chariot had been hitched up, King Jehoram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah went out in their respective chariots to meet Jehu. They met up with him in the plot of land that had once belonged to Naboth of Jezreel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When Jehoram saw Jehu, he asked, "Is everything all right, Jehu?" He replied, "How can everything be all right as long as your mother Jezebel promotes idolatry and pagan practices?"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">pick the best and most capable of your master's sons, place him on his father's throne, and defend your master's dynasty."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They were absolutely terrified and said, "Look, two kings could not stop him! How can we?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So the palace supervisor, the city commissioner, the leaders, and the guardians sent this message to Jehu, "We are your subjects! Whatever you say, we will do. We will not make anyone king. Do what you consider proper."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He wrote them a second letter, saying, "If you are really on my side and are willing to obey me, then take the heads of your master's sons and come to me in Jezreel at this time tomorrow." Now the king had seventy sons, and the prominent men of the city were raising them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When they received the letter, they seized the king's sons and executed all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to him in Jezreel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Jehu said, "Come with me and see how zealous I am for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s cause." So he took him along in his chariot.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">They went inside to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside. He had told them, "If any of the men inside get away, you will pay with your lives!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When he finished offering the burnt sacrifice, Jehu ordered the royal guard and officers, "Come in and strike them down! Don't let any escape!" So the royal guard and officers struck them down with the sword and left their bodies lying there. Then they entered the inner sanctuary of the temple of Baal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They hauled out the sacred pillar of the temple of Baal and burned it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They demolished the sacred pillar of Baal and the temple of Baal; it is used as a latrine to this very day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Ahaz took the silver and gold that were in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple and in the treasuries of the royal palace and sent it as tribute to the king of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The king of Assyria responded favorably to his request; he attacked Damascus and captured it. He deported the people to Kir and executed Rezin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When King Ahaz went to meet with King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria in Damascus, he saw the altar there. King Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest a drawing of the altar and a blueprint for its design.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">When the king arrived back from Damascus and saw the altar, he approached it and offered a sacrifice on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He offered his burnt sacrifice and his grain offering. He poured out his libation and sprinkled the blood from his peace offerings on the altar.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the twelfth year of King Ahaz's reign over Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king over Israel. He reigned in Samaria for nine years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He did evil in the sight of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, but not to the same degree as the Israelite kings who preceded him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">King Shalmaneser of Assyria threatened him; Hoshea became his subject and paid him tribute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was planning a revolt. Hoshea had sent messengers to King So of Egypt and had not sent his annual tribute to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria arrested him and imprisoned him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king of Assyria marched through the whole land. He attacked Samaria and besieged it for three years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In the ninth year of Hoshea's reign, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the people of Israel to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, along the Habor (the river of Gozan), and in the cities of the Medes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">This happened because the Israelites sinned against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> their God, who brought them up from the land of Egypt and freed them from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They worshiped other gods;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">they observed the practices of the nations whom the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had driven out from before Israel, and followed the example of the kings of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Israelites said things about the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> their God that were not right. They built high places in all their cities, from the watchtower to the fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They set up sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They burned incense on all the high places just like the nations whom the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had driven away from before them. Their evil practices made the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They worshiped the disgusting idols in blatant disregard of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s command.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> solemnly warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and all the seers, "Turn back from your evil ways; obey my commandments and rules that are recorded in the law. I ordered your ancestors to keep this law and sent my servants the prophets to remind you of its demands."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But they did not pay attention and were as stubborn as their ancestors, who had not trusted the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They rejected his rules, the covenant he had made with their ancestors, and the laws he had commanded them to obey. They paid allegiance to worthless idols, and so became worthless to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. They copied the practices of the surrounding nations in blatant disregard of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s command.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They abandoned all the commandments of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> their God; they made two metal calves and an Asherah pole, bowed down to all the stars in the sky, and worshiped Baal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They passed their sons and daughters through the fire, and practiced divination and omen reading. They committed themselves to doing evil in the sight of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and made him angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was furious with Israel and rejected them; only the tribe of Judah was left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Judah also failed to keep the commandments of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> their God; they followed Israel's example.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> rejected all of Israel's descendants; he humiliated them and handed them over to robbers, until he had thrown them from his presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He tore Israel away from David's dynasty, and Jeroboam son of Nebat became their king. Jeroboam drove Israel away from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and encouraged them to commit a serious sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The Israelites followed in the sinful ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat and did not repudiate them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Finally the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> rejected Israel just as he had warned he would do through all his servants the prophets. Israel was deported from its land to Assyria and remains there to this very day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The king of Assyria brought foreigners from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the Israelites. They took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they first moved in, they did not worship the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> sent lions among them and the lions were killing them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king of Assyria was told, "The nations whom you deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the requirements of the God of the land, so he has sent lions among them. They are killing the people because they do not know the requirements of the God of the land."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So the king of Assyria ordered, "Take back one of the priests whom you deported from there. He must settle there and teach them the requirements of the God of the land."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So one of the priests whom they had deported from Samaria went back and settled in Bethel. He taught them how to worship the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But each of these nations made its own gods and put them in the shrines on the high places that the people of Samaria had made. Each nation did this in the cities where they lived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The people from Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the people from Cuth made Nergal, the people from Hamath made Ashima,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">They were worshiping the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and at the same time serving their own gods in accordance with the practices of the nations from which they had been deported.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">To this very day they observe their earlier practices.

      <VERS vnumber="35">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> made an agreement with them and instructed them, "You must not worship other gods. Do not bow down to them, serve them, or offer sacrifices to them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">So Hanun seized David's servants and shaved their beards off. He cut off the lower part of their robes so that their buttocks were exposed and then sent them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Messengers came and told David what had happened to the men, so he summoned them, for the men were thoroughly humiliated. The king said, "Stay in Jericho until your beards grow again; then you may come back."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the Ammonites realized that David was disgusted with them, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, Aram Maacah, and Zobah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They hired 32,000 chariots, along with the king of Maacah and his army, who came and camped in front of Medeba. The Ammonites also assembled from their cities and marched out to do battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When David heard the news, he sent Joab and the entire army to meet them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Ammonites marched out and were deployed for battle at the entrance to the city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Joab saw that the battle would be fought on two fronts, he chose some of Israel's best men and deployed them against the Arameans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He put his brother Abishai in charge of the rest of the army and they were deployed against the Ammonites.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">So Joab and his men marched toward the Arameans to do battle, and they fled before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When the Ammonites saw the Arameans flee, they fled before Joab's brother Abishai and withdrew into the city. Joab went back to Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">The Arameans fled before Israel. David killed 7,000 Aramean charioteers and 40,000 infantrymen; he also killed Shophach the commanding general.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the spring, at the time when kings normally conduct wars, Joab led the army into battle and devastated the land of the Ammonites. He went and besieged Rabbah, while David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab defeated Rabbah and tore it down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">David took the crown from the head of their king and wore it (its weight was a talent of gold and it was set with precious stones). He took a large amount of plunder from the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He removed the city's residents and made them do hard labor with saws, iron picks, and axes. This was his policy with all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Later there was a battle with the Philistines in Gezer. At that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were subdued.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Joab replied, "May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> make his army a hundred times larger! My master, O king, do not all of them serve my master? Why does my master want to do this? Why bring judgment on Israel?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the king's edict stood, despite Joab's objections. So Joab left and traveled throughout Israel before returning to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Joab reported to David the number of warriors. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 sword-wielding soldiers; Judah alone had 470,000 sword-wielding soldiers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now Joab did not number Levi and Benjamin, for the king's edict disgusted him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">God was also offended by it, so he attacked Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David said to God, "I have sinned greatly by doing this! Now, please remove the guilt of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> told Gad, David's prophet,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Gad went to David and told him, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says: 'Pick one of these:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">three years of famine, or three months being chased by your enemies and struck down by their swords, or three days being struck down by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, during which a plague will invade the land and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s messenger will destroy throughout Israel's territory.' Now, decide what I should tell the one who sent me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">David said to Gad, "I am very upset! I prefer to be attacked by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, for his mercy is very great; I do not want to be attacked by men!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> sent a plague through Israel, and 70,000 Israelite men died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">God sent an angel to ravage Jerusalem. As he was doing so, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> watched and relented from his judgment. He told the angel who was destroying, "That's enough! Stop now!" Now the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s angel was standing near the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">David looked up and saw the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s messenger standing between the earth and sky with his sword drawn and in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem.

      <VERS vnumber="17">David said to God, "Was I not the one who decided to number the army? I am the one who sinned and committed this awful deed! As for these sheep - what have they done? O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> my God, attack me and my family, but remove the plague from your people!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s messenger told Gad to instruct David to go up and build an altar for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So David went up as Gad instructed him to do in the name of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">When David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David; he came out from the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">David said to Ornan, "Sell me the threshing floor so I can build on it an altar for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> - I'll pay top price - so that the plague may be removed from the people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Ornan told David, "You can have it! My master, the king, may do what he wants. Look, I am giving you the oxen for burnt sacrifices, the threshing sledges for wood, and the wheat for an offering. I give it all to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">King David replied to Ornan, "No, I insist on buying it for top price. I will not offer to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> what belongs to you or offer a burnt sacrifice that cost me nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So David bought the place from Ornan for 600 pieces of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">David built there an altar to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings. He called out to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> responded by sending fire from the sky and consuming the burnt sacrifice on the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> ordered the messenger to put his sword back into its sheath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">At that time, when David saw that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> responded to him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">In the eighteenth year of his reign, he continued his policy of purifying the land and the temple. He sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the city official, and Joah son of Joahaz the secretary to repair the temple of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the silver that had been brought to God's temple.

      <VERS vnumber="33">Josiah removed all the detestable idols from all the areas belonging to the Israelites and encouraged all who were in Israel to worship the LORD their God. Throughout the rest of his reign they did not turn aside from following the LORD God of their ancestors.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, together with Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the vessels intended for the temple of our God - items that the king, his advisers, his officials, and all Israel who were present had contributed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I weighed out to them 650 talents of silver, silver vessels worth 100 talents, 100 talents of gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">20 gold bowls worth 1,000 darics, and two exquisite vessels of gleaming bronze, as valuable as gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then I said to them, "You are holy to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, just as these vessels are holy. The silver and the gold are a voluntary offering to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, the God of your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Be careful with them and protect them, until you weigh them out before the leading priests and the Levites and the family leaders of Israel in Jerusalem, in the storerooms of the temple of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the priests and the Levites took charge of the silver, the gold, and the vessels that had been weighed out, to transport them to Jerusalem to the temple of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">On the twelfth day of the first month we began traveling from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from our enemy and from bandits along the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So we came to Jerusalem, and we stayed there for three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">On the fourth day we weighed out the silver, the gold, and the vessels in the house of our God into the care of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest, and Eleazar son of Phinehas, who were accompanied by Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui, who were Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Everything was verified by number and by weight, and the total weight was written down at that time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The exiles who were returning from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel - twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs, along with twelve male goats as a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then they presented the decrees of the king to the king's satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who gave help to the people and to the temple of God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when these things had been completed, the leaders approached me and said, "The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the local residents who practice detestable things similar to those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Indeed, they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy race has become intermingled with the local residents. Worse still, the leaders and the officials have been at the forefront of all of this!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When I heard this report, I tore my tunic and my robe and ripped out some of the hair from my head and beard. Then I sat down, quite devastated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Everyone who held the words of the God of Israel in awe gathered around me because of the unfaithful acts of the people of the exile. Devastated, I continued to sit there until the evening offering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">At the time of the evening offering I got up from my self-abasement, with my tunic and robe torn, and then dropped to my knees and spread my hands to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> my God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I prayed, "O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift my face to you, my God! For our iniquities have climbed higher than our heads, and our guilt extends to the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">From the days of our fathers until this very day our guilt has been great. Because of our iniquities we, along with our kings and priests, have been delivered over by the local kings to sword, captivity, plunder, and embarrassment - right up to the present time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"But now briefly we have received mercy from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God, in that he has left us a remnant and has given us a secure position in his holy place. Thus our God has enlightened our eyes and has given us a little relief in our time of servitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Although we are slaves, our God has not abandoned us in our servitude. He has extended kindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, in that he has revived us to restore the temple of our God and to raise up its ruins and to give us a protective wall in Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"And now what are we able to say after this, our God? For we have forsaken your commandments</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">which you commanded us through your servants the prophets with these words: 'The land that you are entering to possess is a land defiled by the impurities of the local residents! With their abominations they have filled it from one end to the other with their filthiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons, and do not take their daughters in marriage for your sons. Do not ever seek their peace or welfare, so that you may be strong and may eat the good of the land and may leave it as an inheritance for your children forever.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"Everything that has happened to us has come about because of our wicked actions and our great guilt. Even so, our God, you have exercised restraint toward our iniquities and have given us a remnant such as this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Shall we once again break your commandments and intermarry with these abominable peoples? Would you not be so angered by us that you would wipe us out, with no survivor or remnant?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">O LORD God of Israel, you are righteous, for we are left as a remnant this day. Indeed, we stand before you in our guilt. However, because of this guilt no one can really stand before you."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself to the ground before the temple of God, a very large crowd of Israelites - men, women, and children alike - gathered around him. The people wept loudly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, from the descendants of Elam, addressed Ezra:"We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the local peoples. Nonetheless, there is still hope for Israel in this regard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore let us enact a covenant with our God to send away all these women and their offspring, in keeping with your counsel, my lord, and that of those who respect the commandments of our God. And let it be done according to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Get up, for this matter concerns you. We are with you, so be strong and act decisively!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Ezra got up and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel take an oath to carry out this plan. And they all took a solemn oath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Ezra got up from in front of the temple of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he stayed there, he did not eat food or drink water, for he was in mourning over the infidelity of the exiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">A proclamation was circulated throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles were to be assembled in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Everyone who did not come within three days would thereby forfeit all his property, in keeping with the counsel of the officials and the elders. Furthermore, he himself would be excluded from the assembly of the exiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All the men of Judah and Benjamin were gathered in Jerusalem within the three days. (It was in the ninth month, on the twentieth day of that month.) All the people sat in the square at the temple of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the rains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have behaved in an unfaithful manner by taking foreign wives! This has contributed to the guilt of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now give praise to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of your fathers, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the local residents and from these foreign wives."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All the assembly replied in a loud voice: "We will do just as you have said!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">However, the people are numerous and it is the rainy season. We are unable to stand here outside. Furthermore, this business cannot be resolved in a day or two, for we have sinned greatly in this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let our leaders take steps on behalf of all the assembly.

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">These are the words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:It so happened that in the month of Kislev, in the twentieth year, I was in Susa the citadel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Hanani, who was one of my relatives, along with some of the men from Judah, came to me, and I asked them about the Jews who had escaped and had survived the exile, and about Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They said to me, "The remnant that remains from the exile there in the province are experiencing considerable adversity and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem lies breached, and its gates have been burned down!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When I heard these things I sat down abruptly, crying and mourning for several days. I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then I said, "Please, O LORD God of heaven, great and awesome God, who keeps his loving covenant with those who love him and obey his commandments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">may your ear be attentive and your eyes be open to hear the prayer of your servant that I am praying to you today throughout both day and night on behalf of your servants the Israelites. I am confessing the sins of the Israelites that we have committed against you - both I myself and my family have sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We have behaved corruptly against you, not obeying the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments that you commanded your servant Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Please recall the word you commanded your servant Moses: 'If you act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if you repent and obey my commandments and do them, then even if your dispersed people are in the most remote location, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen for my name to reside.'</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought to me, I took the wine and gave it to the king. Previously I had not been depressed in the king's presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So the king said to me, "Why do you appear to be depressed when you aren't sick? What can this be other than sadness of heart?" This made me very fearful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I replied to the king, "O king, live forever! Why would I not appear dejected when the city with the graves of my ancestors lies desolate and its gates destroyed by fire?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The king responded, "What is it you are seeking?" Then I quickly prayed to the God of heaven</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and said to the king, "If the king is so inclined and if your servant has found favor in your sight, dispatch me to Judah, to the city with the graves of my ancestors, so that I can rebuild it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the king, with his consort sitting beside him, replied, "How long would your trip take, and when would you return?" Since the king was amenable to dispatching me, I gave him a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I said to the king, "If the king is so inclined, let him give me letters for the governors of Trans-Euphrates that will enable me to travel safely until I reach Judah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and a letter for Asaph the keeper of the king's nature preserve, so that he will give me timber for beams for the gates of the fortress adjacent to the temple and for the city wall and for the house to which I go." So the king granted me these requests, for the good hand of my God was on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, and I presented to them the letters from the king. The king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard all this, they were very displeased that someone had come to seek benefit for the Israelites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I came to Jerusalem. When I had been there for three days,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I got up during the night, along with a few men who were with me. But I did not tell anyone what my God was putting on my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no animals with me, except for the one I was riding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I proceeded through the Valley Gate by night, in the direction of the Well of the Dragons and the Dung Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem that had been breached and its gates that had been destroyed by fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I passed on to the Gate of the Well and the King's Pool, where there was not enough room for my animal to pass with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I continued up the valley during the night, inspecting the wall. Then I turned back and came to the Valley Gate, and so returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had been doing, for up to this point I had not told any of the Jews or the priests or the nobles or the officials or the rest of the workers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then I said to them, "You see the problem that we have: Jerusalem is desolate and its gates are burned. Come on! Let's rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that this reproach will not continue."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then I related to them how the good hand of my God was on me and what the king had said to me. Then they replied, "Let's begin rebuilding right away!" So they readied themselves for this good project.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard all this, they derided us and expressed contempt toward us. They said, "What is this you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">From that day forward, half of my men were doing the work and half of them were taking up spears, shields, bows, and body armor. Now the officers were behind all the people of Judah</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">who were rebuilding the wall. Those who were carrying loads did so by keeping one hand on the work and the other on their weapon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The builders to a man had their swords strapped to their sides while they were building. But the trumpeter remained with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, "The work is demanding and extensive, and we are spread out on the wall, far removed from one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, gather there with us. Our God will fight for us!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So we worked on, with half holding spears, from dawn till dusk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">At that time I instructed the people, "Let every man and his coworker spend the night in Jerusalem and let them be guards for us by night and workers by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">We did not change clothes - not I, nor my relatives, nor my workers, nor the watchmen who were with me. Each had his weapon, even when getting a drink of water.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their fellow Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There were those who said, "With our sons and daughters, we are many. We must obtain grain in order to eat and stay alive."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">There were others who said, "We are putting up our fields, our vineyards, and our houses as collateral in order to obtain grain during the famine."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then there were those who said, "We have borrowed money to pay our taxes to the king on our fields and our vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And now, though we share the same flesh and blood as our fellow countrymen, and our children are just like their children, still we have found it necessary to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have been subjected to slavery, while we are powerless to help, since our fields and vineyards now belong to other people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these complaints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I considered these things carefully and then registered a complaint with the wealthy and the officials. I said to them, "Each one of you is seizing the collateral from your own countrymen!" Because of them I called for a great public assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I said to them, "To the extent possible we have bought back our fellow Jews who had been sold to the Gentiles. But now you yourselves want to sell your own countrymen, so that we can then buy them back!" They were utterly silent, and could find nothing to say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then I said, "The thing that you are doing is wrong! Should you not conduct yourselves in the fear of our God in order to avoid the reproach of the Gentiles who are our enemies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Even I and my relatives and my associates are lending them money and grain. But let us abandon this practice of seizing collateral!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This very day return to them their fields, their vineyards, their olive trees, and their houses, along with the interest that you are exacting from them on the money, the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They replied, "We will return these things, and we will no longer demand anything from them. We will do just as you say." Then I called the priests and made the wealthy and the officials swear to do what had been promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I also shook out my garment, and I said, "In this way may God shake out from his house and his property every person who does not carry out this matter. In this way may he be shaken out and emptied!" All the assembly replied, "So be it!" and they praised the LORD. Then the people did as they had promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">From the day that I was appointed governor in the land of Judah, that is, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes - twelve years in all - neither I nor my relatives ate the food allotted to the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the former governors who preceded me had burdened the people and had taken food and wine from them, in addition to forty shekels of silver. Their associates were also domineering over the people. But I did not behave in this way, due to my fear of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I gave myself to the work on this wall, without even purchasing a field. All my associates were gathered there for the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">There were 150 Jews and officials who dined with me routinely, in addition to those who came to us from the nations all around us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Every day one ox, six select sheep, and some birds were prepared for me, and every ten days all kinds of wine in abundance. Despite all this I did not require the food allotted to the governor, for the work was demanding on this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Please remember me for good, O my God, for all that I have done for this people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and no breach remained in it (even though up to that time I had not positioned doors in the gates),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Sanballat and Geshem sent word to me saying, "Come on! Let's set up a time to meet together at Kephirim in the plain of Ono." Now they intended to do me harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So I sent messengers to them saying, "I am engaged in an important work, and I am unable to come down. Why should the work come to a halt when I leave it to come down to you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They contacted me four times in this way, and I responded the same way each time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The fifth time that Sanballat sent his assistant to me in this way, he had an open letter in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Written in it were the following words:"Among the nations it is rumored (and Geshem has substantiated this) that you and the Jews have intentions of revolting, and for this reason you are building the wall. Furthermore, according to these rumors you are going to become their king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You have also established prophets to announce in Jerusalem on your behalf, 'We have a king in Judah!' Now the king is going to hear about these rumors. So come on! Let's talk about this."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I sent word back to him, "We are not engaged in these activities you are describing. All of this is a figment of your imagination."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All of them were wanting to scare us, supposing, "Their hands will grow slack from the work, and it won't get done."So now, strengthen my hands!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel. He was confined to his home. He said, "Let's set up a time to meet in the house of God, within the temple. Let's close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. It will surely be at night that they will come to kill you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But I replied, "Should a man like me run away? Would someone like me flee to the temple in order to save his life? I will not go!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I recognized the fact that God had not sent him, for he had spoken the prophecy against me as a hired agent of Tobiah and Sanballat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He had been hired to scare me so that I would do this and thereby sin. They would thus bring reproach on me and I would be discredited.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat in light of these actions of theirs - also Noadiah the prophetess and the other prophets who were trying to scare me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in just fifty-two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When all our enemies heard and all the nations who were around us saw this, they were greatly disheartened. They knew that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In those days the aristocrats of Judah repeatedly sent letters to Tobiah, and responses from Tobiah were repeatedly coming to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For many in Judah had sworn allegiance to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. His son Jonathan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They were telling me about his good deeds and then taking back to him the things I said. Tobiah, on the other hand, sent letters in order to scare me.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When the wall had been rebuilt and I had positioned the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I then put in charge over Jerusalem my brother Hanani and Hananiah the chief of the citadel, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I said to them, "The gates of Jerusalem must not be opened in the early morning, until those who are standing guard close the doors and lock them. Position residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their guard stations and some near their homes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the city was spread out and large, and there were not a lot of people in it. At that time houses had not been rebuilt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">My God placed it on my heart to gather the leaders, the officials, and the ordinary people so they could be enrolled on the basis of genealogy. I found the genealogical records of those who had formerly returned. Here is what I found written in that record:</VERS>

Do not mourn or weep." For all the people had been weeping when they heard the words of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said to them, "Go and eat delicacies and drink sweet drinks and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared. For this day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">When the evening shadows began to fall on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered the doors to be closed. I further directed that they were not to be opened until after the Sabbath. I positioned some of my young men at the gates so that no load could enter on the Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The traders and sellers of all kinds of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But I warned them and said, "Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you repeat this, I will forcibly remove you!" From that time on they did not show up on the Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then I directed the Levites to purify themselves and come and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy.For this please remember me, O my God, and have pity on me in keeping with your great love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Also in those days I saw the men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod (or the language of one of the other peoples mentioned ) and were unable to speak the language of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So I entered a complaint with them. I called down a curse on them, and I struck some of the men and pulled out their hair. I had them swear by God saying, "You will not marry off your daughters to their sons, and you will not take any of their daughters as wives for your sons or for yourselves!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Was it not because of things like these that King Solomon of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. But the foreign wives made even him sin!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Should we then in your case hear that you do all this great evil, thereby being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign wives?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now one of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite. So I banished him from my sight.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">So I purified them of everything foreign, and I assigned specific duties to the priests and the Levites.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">He displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his majestic greatness for a lengthy period of time - a hundred and eighty days, to be exact!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When those days were completed, the king then provided a seven-day banquet for all the people who were present in Susa the citadel, for those of highest standing to the most lowly. It was held in the court located in the garden of the royal palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The furnishings included linen and purple curtains hung by cords of the finest linen and purple wool on silver rings, alabaster columns, gold and silver couches displayed on a floor made of valuable stones of alabaster, mother-of-pearl, and mineral stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Drinks were served in golden containers, all of which differed from one another. Royal wine was available in abundance at the king's expense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">There were no restrictions on the drinking, for the king had instructed all of his supervisors that they should do as everyone so desired.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in King Ahasuerus' royal palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On the seventh day, as King Ahasuerus was feeling the effects of the wine, he ordered Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who attended him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">to bring Queen Vashti into the king's presence wearing her royal high turban. He wanted to show the people and the officials her beauty, for she was very attractive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's bidding conveyed through the eunuchs. Then the king became extremely angry, and his rage consumed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The king then inquired of the wise men who were discerners of the times - for it was the royal custom to confer with all those who were proficient in laws and legalities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Those who were closest to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. These men were the seven officials of Persia and Media who saw the king on a regular basis and had the most prominent offices in the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The king asked, "By law, what should be done to Queen Vashti in light of the fact that she has not obeyed the instructions of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Memucan then replied to the king and the officials, "The wrong of Queen Vashti is not against the king alone, but against all the officials and all the people who are throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the matter concerning the queen will spread to all the women, leading them to treat their husbands with contempt, saying, 'When King Ahasuerus gave orders to bring Queen Vashti into his presence, she would not come.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media who have heard the matter concerning the queen will respond in the same way to all the royal officials, and there will be more than enough contempt and anger!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If the king is so inclined, let a royal edict go forth from him, and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media that cannot be repealed, that Vashti may not come into the presence of King Ahasuerus, and let the king convey her royalty to another who is more deserving than she.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And let the king's decision which he will enact be disseminated throughout all his kingdom, vast though it is. Then all the women will give honor to their husbands, from the most prominent to the lowly."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The matter seemed appropriate to the king and the officials. So the king acted on the advice of Memucan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He sent letters throughout all the royal provinces, to each province according to its own script and to each people according to its own language, that every man should be ruling his family and should be speaking the language of his own people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When these things had been accomplished and the rage of King Ahasuerus had diminished, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decided against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The king's servants who attended him said, "Let a search be conducted in the king's behalf for attractive young women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And let the king appoint officers throughout all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the attractive young women to Susa the citadel, to the harem under the authority of Hegai, the king's eunuch who oversees the women, and let him provide whatever cosmetics they desire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Let the young woman whom the king finds most attractive become queen in place of Vashti." This seemed like a good idea to the king, so he acted accordingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now there happened to be a Jewish man in Susa the citadel whose name was Mordecai. He was the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried into exile with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now he was acting as the guardian of Hadassah (that is, Esther), the daughter of his uncle, for neither her father nor her mother was alive. This young woman was very attractive and had a beautiful figure. When her father and mother died, Mordecai had raised her as if she were his own daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It so happened that when the king's edict and his law became known many young women were taken to Susa the citadel to be placed under the authority of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the royal palace to be under the authority of Hegai, who was overseeing the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This young woman pleased him, and she found favor with him. He quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her rations; he also provided her with the seven specially chosen young women who were from the palace. He then transferred her and her young women to the best quarters in the harem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now Esther had not disclosed her people or her lineage, for Mordecai had instructed her not to do so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And day after day Mordecai used to walk back and forth in front of the court of the harem in order to learn how Esther was doing and what might happen to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">At the end of the twelve months that were required for the women, when the turn of each young woman arrived to go to King Ahasuerus - for in this way they had to fulfill their time of cosmetic treatment: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfume and various ointments used by women -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">the woman would go to the king in the following way: Whatever she asked for would be provided for her to take with her from the harem to the royal palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to a separate part of the harem, to the authority of Shaashgaz the king's eunuch who was overseeing the concubines. She would not go back to the king unless the king was pleased with her and she was requested by name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When it became the turn of Esther daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai (who had raised her as if she were his own daughter ) to go to the king, she did not request anything except what Hegai the king's eunuch, who was overseer of the women, had recommended. Yet Esther met with the approval of all who saw her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus at his royal residence in the tenth month (that is, the month of Tebeth) in the seventh year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she met with his loving approval more than all the other young women. So he placed the royal high turban on her head and appointed her queen in place of Vashti.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king prepared a large banquet for all his officials and his servants - it was actually Esther's banquet. He also set aside a holiday for the provinces, and he provided for offerings at the king's expense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now when the young women were being gathered again, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Esther was still not divulging her lineage or her people, just as Mordecai had instructed her. Esther continued to do whatever Mordecai said, just as she had done when he was raising her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In those days while Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs who protected the entrance, became angry and plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When Mordecai learned of the conspiracy, he informed Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in Mordecai's behalf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The king then had the matter investigated and, finding it to be so, had the two conspirators hanged on a gallows. It was then recorded in the daily chronicles in the king's presence.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Some time later King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, exalting him and setting his position above that of all the officials who were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">As a result, all the king's servants who were at the king's gate were bowing and paying homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded. However, Mordecai did not bow, nor did he pay him homage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the servants of the king who were at the king's gate asked Mordecai, "Why are you violating the king's commandment?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And after they had spoken to him day after day without his paying any attention to them, they informed Haman to see whether this attitude on Mordecai's part would be permitted. Furthermore, he had disclosed to them that he was a Jew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Haman saw that Mordecai was not bowing or paying homage to him, he was filled with rage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the thought of striking out against Mordecai alone was repugnant to him, for he had been informed of the identity of Mordecai's people. So Haman sought to destroy all the Jews (that is, the people of Mordecai) who were in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the first month (that is, the month of Nisan), in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus' reign, pur (that is, the lot) was cast before Haman in order to determine a day and a month. It turned out to be the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a particular people that is dispersed and spread among the inhabitants throughout all the provinces of your kingdom whose laws differ from those of all other peoples. Furthermore, they do not observe the king's laws. It is not appropriate for the king to provide a haven for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If the king is so inclined, let an edict be issued to destroy them. I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to be conveyed to the king's treasuries for the officials who carry out this business."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the king removed his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, who was hostile toward the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The king replied to Haman, "Keep your money, and do with those people whatever you wish."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the royal scribes were summoned in the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month. Everything Haman commanded was written to the king's satraps and governors who were in every province and to the officials of every people, province by province according to its script and people by people according to its language. In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written and sealed with the king's signet ring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Letters were sent by the runners to all the king's provinces stating that they should destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews, from youth to elderly, both women and children, on a particular day, namely the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar), and to loot and plunder their possessions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">A copy of this edict was to be presented as law throughout every province; it was to be made known to all the inhabitants, so that they would be prepared for this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The messengers scurried forth with the king's order. The edict was issued in Susa the citadel. While the king and Haman sat down to drink, the city of Susa was in an uproar!</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Mordecai became aware of all that had been done, he tore his garments and put on sackcloth and ashes. He went out into the city, crying out in a loud and bitter voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But he went no further than the king's gate, for no one was permitted to enter the king's gate clothed in sackcloth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Throughout each and every province where the king's edict and law were announced there was considerable mourning among the Jews, along with fasting, weeping, and sorrow. Sackcloth and ashes were characteristic of many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When Esther's female attendants and her eunuchs came and informed her about Mordecai's behavior, the queen was overcome with anguish. Although she sent garments for Mordecai to put on so that he could remove his sackcloth, he would not accept them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs who had been placed at her service, and instructed him to find out the cause and reason for Mordecai's behavior.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Hathach went to Mordecai at the plaza of the city in front of the king's gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Mordecai related to him everything that had happened to him, even the specific amount of money that Haman had offered to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews to be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He also gave him a written copy of the law that had been disseminated in Susa for their destruction so that he could show it to Esther and talk to her about it. He also gave instructions that she should go to the king to implore him and petition him on behalf of her people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Hathach returned and related Mordecai's instructions to Esther.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Esther replied to Hathach with instructions for Mordecai:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"All the servants of the king and the people of the king's provinces know that there is only one law applicable to any man or woman who comes uninvited to the king in the inner court - that person will be put to death, unless the king extends to him the gold scepter, permitting him to be spared. Now I have not been invited to come to the king for some thirty days!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When Esther's reply was conveyed to Mordecai,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">he said to take back this answer to Esther:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"Don't imagine that because you are part of the king's household you will be the one Jew who will escape. If you keep quiet at this time, liberation and protection for the Jews will appear from another source, while you and your father's household perish. It may very well be that you have achieved royal status for such a time as this!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"Go, assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa and fast in my behalf. Don't eat and don't drink for three days, night or day. My female attendants and I will also fast in the same way. Afterward I will go to the king, even though it violates the law. If I perish, I perish!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So Mordecai set out to do everything that Esther had instructed him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It so happened that on the third day Esther put on her royal attire and stood in the inner court of the palace, opposite the king's quarters. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the palace, opposite the entrance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she met with his approval. The king extended to Esther the gold scepter that was in his hand, and Esther approached and touched the end of the scepter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The king said to her, "What is on your mind, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even as much as half the kingdom will be given to you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Esther replied, "If the king is so inclined, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king replied, "Find Haman quickly so that we can do as Esther requests."So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">While at the banquet of wine, the king said to Esther, "What is your request? It shall be given to you. What is your petition? Ask for as much as half the kingdom, and it shall be done!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Esther responded, "My request and my petition is this:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If I have found favor in the king's sight and if the king is inclined to grant my request and perform my petition, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet that I will prepare for them. At that time I will do as the king wishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now Haman went forth that day pleased and very much encouraged. But when Haman saw Mordecai at the king's gate, and he did not rise nor tremble in his presence, Haman was filled with rage toward Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Haman restrained himself and went on to his home.He then sent for his friends to join him, along with his wife Zeresh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Haman then recounted to them his fabulous wealth, his many sons, and how the king had magnified him and exalted him over the king's other officials and servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Haman said, "Furthermore, Queen Esther invited only me to accompany the king to the banquet that she prepared! And also tomorrow I am invited along with the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yet all of this fails to satisfy me so long as I have to see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Haman's wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, "Have a gallows seventy-five feet high built, and in the morning tell the king that Mordecai should be hanged on it. Then go with the king to the banquet contented." It seemed like a good idea to Haman, so he had the gallows built.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Throughout that night the king was unable to sleep, so he asked for the book containing the historical records to be brought. As the records were being read in the king's presence,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">it was found written that Mordecai had disclosed that Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs who guarded the entrance, had plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The king asked, "What great honor was bestowed on Mordecai because of this?" The king's attendants who served him responded, "Not a thing was done for him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the king said, "Who is that in the courtyard?" Now Haman had come to the outer courtyard of the palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had constructed for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king's attendants said to him, "It is Haman who is standing in the courtyard." The king said, "Let him enter."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Haman came in, and the king said to him, "What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?" Haman thought to himself, "Who is it that the king would want to honor more than me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Haman said to the king, "For the man whom the king wishes to honor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">let them bring royal attire which the king himself has worn and a horse on which the king himself has ridden - one bearing the royal insignia!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then let this clothing and this horse be given to one of the king's noble officials. Let him then clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor, and let him lead him about through the plaza of the city on the horse, calling before him, 'So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The king then said to Haman, "Go quickly! Take the clothing and the horse, just as you have described, and do as you just indicated to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king's gate. Don't neglect a single thing of all that you have said."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So Haman took the clothing and the horse, and he clothed Mordecai. He led him about on the horse throughout the plaza of the city, calling before him, "So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Mordecai again sat at the king's gate, while Haman hurried away to his home, mournful and with a veil over his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Haman then related to his wife Zeresh and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. These wise men, along with his wife Zeresh, said to him, "If indeed this Mordecai before whom you have begun to fall is Jewish, you will not prevail against him. No, you will surely fall before him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">While they were still speaking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived. They quickly brought Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So the king and Haman came to dine with Queen Esther.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">On the second day of the banquet of wine the king asked Esther, "What is your request, Queen Esther? It shall be granted to you. And what is your petition? Ask up to half the kingdom, and it shall be done!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Queen Esther replied, "If I have met with your approval, O king, and if the king is so inclined, grant me my life as my request, and my people as my petition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For we have been sold - both I and my people - to destruction and to slaughter and to annihilation! If we had simply been sold as male and female slaves, I would have remained silent, for such distress would not have been sufficient for troubling the king."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then King Ahasuerus responded to Queen Esther, "Who is this individual? Where is this person to be found who is presumptuous enough to act in this way?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Esther replied, "The oppressor and enemy is this evil Haman!"Then Haman became terrified in the presence of the king and queen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In rage the king arose from the banquet of wine and withdrew to the palace garden. Meanwhile, Haman stood to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he realized that the king had now determined a catastrophic end for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet of wine, Haman was throwing himself down on the couch where Esther was lying. The king exclaimed, "Will he also attempt to rape the queen while I am still in the building!"As these words left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Harbona, one of the king's eunuchs, said, "Indeed, there is the gallows that Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke out in the king's behalf. It stands near Haman's home and is seventy-five feet high."The king said, "Hang him on it!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they hanged Haman on the very gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. The king's rage then abated.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On that same day King Ahasuerus gave the estate of Haman, that adversary of the Jews, to Queen Esther. Now Mordecai had come before the king, for Esther had revealed how he was related to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The king then removed his signet ring (the very one he had taken back from Haman) and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther designated Mordecai to be in charge of Haman's estate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Esther again spoke with the king, falling at his feet. She wept and begged him for mercy, that he might nullify the evil of Haman the Agagite which he had intended against the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the king extended to Esther the gold scepter, she arose and stood before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">She said, "If the king is so inclined and if I have met with his approval and if the matter is agreeable to the king and if I am attractive to him, let an edict be written rescinding those recorded intentions of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, which he wrote in order to destroy the Jews who are throughout all the king's provinces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For how can I watch the calamity that will befall my people, and how can I watch the destruction of my relatives?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">King Ahasuerus replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, "Look, I have already given Haman's estate to Esther, and he has been hanged on the gallows because he took hostile action against the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now you write in the king's name whatever in your opinion is appropriate concerning the Jews and seal it with the king's signet ring. Any decree that is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's signet ring cannot be rescinded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The king's scribes were quickly summoned - in the third month (that is, the month of Sivan), on the twenty-third day. They wrote out everything that Mordecai instructed to the Jews and to the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces all the way from India to Ethiopia - a hundred and twenty-seven provinces in all - to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, and to the Jews according to their own script and their own language.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king's signet ring. He then sent letters by couriers on horses, who rode royal horses that were very swift.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The king thereby allowed the Jews who were in every city to assemble and to stand up for themselves - to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any army of whatever people or province that should become their adversaries, including their women and children, and to confiscate their property.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">This was to take place on a certain day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus - namely, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">A copy of the edict was to be presented as law throughout each and every province and made known to all peoples, so that the Jews might be prepared on that day to avenge themselves from their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The couriers who were riding the royal horses went forth with the king's edict without delay. And the law was presented in Susa the citadel as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now Mordecai went out from the king's presence in purple and white royal attire, with a large golden crown and a purple linen mantle. The city of Susa shouted with joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For the Jews there was radiant happiness and joyous honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Throughout every province and throughout every city where the king's edict and his law arrived, the Jews experienced happiness and joy, banquets and holidays. Many of the resident peoples pretended to be Jews, because the fear of the Jews had overcome them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar), on its thirteenth day, the edict of the king and his law were to be executed. It was on this day that the enemies of the Jews had supposed that they would gain power over them. But contrary to expectations, the Jews gained power over their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Jews assembled themselves in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to strike out against those who were seeking their harm. No one was able to stand before them, for dread of them fell on all the peoples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and those who performed the king's business were assisting the Jews, for the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Mordecai was of high rank in the king's palace, and word about him was spreading throughout all the provinces. His influence continued to become greater and greater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, bringing death and destruction, and they did as they pleased with their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In Susa the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In addition, they also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not confiscate their property.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">On that same day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was brought to the king's attention.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the king said to Queen Esther, "In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman! What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? What is your request? It shall be given to you. What other petition do you have? It shall be done."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Esther replied, "If the king is so inclined, let the Jews who are in Susa be permitted to act tomorrow also according to today's law, and let them hang the ten sons of Haman on the gallows."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So the king issued orders for this to be done. A law was passed in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Jews who were in Susa then assembled on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they killed three hundred men in Susa. But they did not confiscate their property.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The rest of the Jews who were throughout the provinces of the king assembled in order to stand up for themselves and to have rest from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of their adversaries, but they did not confiscate their property.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">All of this happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. They then rested on the fourteenth day and made it a day for banqueting and happiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth days, and rested on the fifteenth, making it a day for banqueting and happiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This is why the Jews who are in the rural country - those who live in rural cities - set aside the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a holiday for happiness, banqueting, holiday, and sending gifts to one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Mordecai wrote these matters down and sent letters to all the Jews who were throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">to have them observe the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of the month of Adar each year</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">as the time when the Jews gave themselves rest from their enemies - the month when their trouble was turned to happiness and their mourning to a holiday. These were to be days of banqueting, happiness, sending gifts to one another, and providing for the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So the Jews committed themselves to continue what they had begun to do and to what Mordecai had written to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised plans against the Jews to destroy them. He had cast pur (that is, the lot) in order to afflict and destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But when the matter came to the king's attention, the king gave written orders that Haman's evil intentions that he had devised against the Jews should fall on his own head. He and his sons were hanged on the gallows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For this reason these days are known as Purim, after the name of pur.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore, because of the account found in this letter and what they had faced in this regard and what had happened to them, the Jews established as binding on themselves, their descendants, and all who joined their company that they should observe these two days without fail, just as written and at the appropriate time on an annual basis.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">These days were to be remembered and to be celebrated in every generation and in every family, every province, and every city. The Jews were not to fail to observe these days of Purim; the remembrance of them was not to cease among their descendants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Letters were sent to all the Jews in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the empire of Ahasuerus - words of true peace -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">to establish these days of Purim in their proper times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established, and just as they had established both for themselves and their descendants, matters pertaining to fasting and lamentation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Esther's command established these matters of Purim, and the matter was officially recorded.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">King Ahasuerus then imposed forced labor on the land and on the coastlands of the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now all the actions carried out under his authority and his great achievements, along with an exact statement concerning the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king promoted, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus. He was the highest-ranking Jew, and he was admired by his numerous relatives. He worked enthusiastically for the good of his people and was an advocate for the welfare of all his descendants.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="18" bname="Job" bsname="Job">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And that man was pure and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His possessions included 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys; in addition he had a very great household. Thus he was the greatest of all the people in the east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one in turn, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When the days of their feasting were finished, Job would send for them and sanctify them; he would get up early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job thought, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's customary practice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> - and Satan also arrived among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" And Satan answered the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "From roving about on the earth, and from walking back and forth across it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a pure and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Satan answered the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "Is it for nothing that Job fears God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Have you not made a hedge around him and his household and all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have increased in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But extend your hand and strike  everything he has, and he will no doubt curse you to your face!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Satan, "All right then, everything he has is in your power. Only do not extend your hand against the man himself!" So Satan went out from the presence of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now the day came when Job's sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and a messenger came to Job, saying, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and the Sabeans swooped down and carried them all away, and they killed the servants with the sword! And I - only I alone - escaped to tell you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">While this one was still speaking, another messenger arrived and said, "The fire of God has fallen from heaven and has burned up the sheep and the servants - it has consumed them! And I - only I alone - escaped to tell you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, "The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and carried them all away, and they killed the servants with the sword! And I - only I alone - escaped to tell you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and suddenly a great wind swept across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they died! And I - only I alone - escaped to tell you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Job got up and tore his robe. He shaved his head, and then he threw himself down with his face to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will return there. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> gives, and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> takes away. May the name of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> be blessed!"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Again the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, and Satan also arrived among them to present himself before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Satan, "Where do you come from?" Satan answered the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "From roving about on the earth, and from walking back and forth across it."</VERS>

For there is no one like him on the earth, a pure and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil. And he still holds firmly to his integrity, so that you stirred me up to destroy him without reason."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Satan answered the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "Skin for skin! Indeed, a man will give up all that he has to save his life!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But extend your hand and strike his bone and his flesh, and he will no doubt curse you to your face!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Satan, "All right, he is in your power; only preserve his life."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Satan went out from the presence of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, and he afflicted Job with a malignant ulcer from the sole of his feet to the top of his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Job took a shard of broken pottery to scrape himself with while he was sitting among the ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then his wife said to him, "Are you still holding firmly to your integrity? Curse God, and die!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But he replied, "You're talking like one of the godless women would do! Should we receive what is good from God, and not also receive what is evil?" In all this Job did not sin by what he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When Job's three friends heard about all this calamity that had happened to him, each of them came from his own country - Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They met together to come to show sympathy for him and to console him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when they gazed intently from a distance but did not recognize him, they began to weep loudly. Each of them tore his robes, and they threw dust into the air over their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then they sat down with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, yet no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Job spoke up and said:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"Let the day on which I was born perish, and the night that said, 'A man has been conceived!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">That day - let it be darkness; let not God on high regard it, nor let light shine on it!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">"Listen to my words, you wise men; hear me, you learned men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the ear assesses words as the mouth tastes food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Let us evaluate for ourselves what is right; let us come to know among ourselves what is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For Job says, 'I am innocent, but God turns away my right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Concerning my right, should I lie? My wound is incurable, although I am without transgression.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What man is like Job, who drinks derision like water!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He goes about in company with evildoers, he goes along with wicked men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For he says, 'It does not profit a man when he makes his delight with God.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wickedness, from the Almighty to do evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For he repays a person for his work, and according to the conduct of a person, he causes the consequences to find him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Indeed, in truth, God does not act wickedly, and the Almighty does not pervert justice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Who entrusted to him the earth? And who put him over the whole world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If God were to set his heart on it, and gather in his spirit and his breath,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">all flesh would perish together and human beings would return to dust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"If you have understanding, listen to this, hear what I have to say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Do you really think that one who hates justice can govern? And will you declare guilty the supremely righteous One,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">who says to a king, 'Worthless man' and to nobles, 'Wicked men,'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who shows no partiality to princes, and does not take note of the rich more than the poor, because all of them are the work of his hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">In a moment they die, in the middle of the night, people are shaken and they pass away. The mighty are removed effortlessly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For his eyes are on the ways of an individual, he observes all a person's steps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">There is no darkness, and no deep darkness, where evildoers can hide themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For he does not still consider a person, that he should come before God in judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He shatters the great without inquiry, and sets up others in their place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore, he knows their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He strikes them for their wickedness, in a place where people can see,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">because they have turned away from following him, and have not understood any of his ways,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">so that they caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he hears the cry of the needy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But if God is quiet, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, then who can see him? Yet he is over the individual and the nation alike,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">so that the godless man should not rule, and not lay snares for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">"Has anyone said to God, 'I have endured chastisement, but I will not act wrongly any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Teach me what I cannot see. If I have done evil, I will do so no more.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Is it your opinion that God should recompense it, because you reject this? But you must choose, and not I, so tell us what you know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Men of understanding say to me - any wise man listening to me says -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">that Job speaks without knowledge and his words are without understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But Job will be tested to the end, because his answers are like those of wicked men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For he adds transgression to his sin; in our midst he claps his hands, and multiplies his words against God."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="35">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Elihu answered:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Do you think this to be just: when you say, 'My right before God.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But you say, 'What will it profit you,' and, 'What do I gain by not sinning?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I will reply to you, and to your friends with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Gaze at the heavens and see; consider the clouds, which are higher than you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If you sin, how does it affect God? If your transgressions are many, what does it do to him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If you are righteous, what do you give to God, or what does he receive from your hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Your wickedness affects only a person like yourself, and your righteousness only other people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">"People cry out because of the excess of oppression; they cry out for help because of the power of the mighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But no one says, 'Where is God, my Creator, who gives songs in the night,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">who teaches us more than the wild animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they cry out - but he does not answer - because of the arrogance of the wicked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Surely it is an empty cry - God does not hear it; the Almighty does not take notice of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">How much less, then, when you say that you do not perceive him, that the case is before him and you are waiting for him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And further, when you say that his anger does not punish, and that he does not know transgression!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Job opens his mouth to no purpose; without knowledge he multiplies words."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="36">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Elihu said further:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Be patient with me a little longer and I will instruct you, for I still have words to speak on God's behalf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">With my knowledge I will speak comprehensively, and to my Creator I will ascribe righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For in truth, my words are not false; it is one complete in knowledge who is with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Indeed, God is mighty; and he does not despise people, he is mighty, and firm in his intent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He does not allow the wicked to live, but he gives justice to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He does not take his eyes off the righteous; but with kings on the throne he seats the righteous and exalts them forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if they are bound in chains, and held captive by the cords of affliction,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">then he reveals to them what they have done, and their transgressions, that they were behaving proudly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he reveals this for correction, and says that they must turn from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If they obey and serve him, they live out their days in prosperity and their years in pleasantness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But if they refuse to listen, they pass over the river of death, and expire without knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The godless at heart nourish anger, they do not cry out even when he binds them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They die in their youth, and their life ends among the male cultic prostitutes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He delivers the afflicted by their afflictions, he reveals himself to them by their suffering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And surely, he drew you from the mouth of distress, to a wide place, unrestricted, and to the comfort of your table filled with rich food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But now you are preoccupied with the judgment due the wicked, judgment and justice take hold of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Be careful that no one entices you with riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Would your wealth sustain you, so that you would not be in distress, even all your mighty efforts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Do not long for the cover of night to drag people away from their homes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Take heed, do not turn to evil, for because of this you have been tested by affliction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Indeed, God is exalted in his power; who is a teacher like him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Who has prescribed his ways for him? Or said to him, 'You have done what is wicked'?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Remember to extol his work, which people have praised in song.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">All humanity has seen it; people gaze on it from afar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">"Yes, God is great - beyond our knowledge! The number of his years is unsearchable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He draws up drops of water; they distill the rain into its mist,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">which the clouds pour down and shower on humankind abundantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Who can understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">See how he scattered his lightning about him; he has covered the depths of the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is by these that he judges the nations and supplies food in abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">With his hands he covers the lightning, and directs it against its target.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">His thunder announces the coming storm, the cattle also, concerning the storm's approach.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="37">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At this also my heart pounds and leaps from its place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Listen carefully to the thunder of his voice, to the rumbling that proceeds from his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Under the whole heaven he lets it go, even his lightning to the far corners of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">After that a voice roars; he thunders with an exalted voice, and he does not hold back his lightning bolts when his voice is heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God thunders with his voice in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For to the snow he says, 'Fall to earth,' and to the torrential rains, 'Pour down.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He causes everyone to stop working, so that all people may know his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The wild animals go to their lairs, and in their dens they remain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A tempest blows out from its chamber, icy cold from the driving winds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The breath of God produces ice, and the breadth of the waters freeze solid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through the clouds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The clouds go round in circles, wheeling about according to his plans, to carry out all that he commands them over the face of the whole inhabited world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Whether it is for punishment for his land, or whether it is for mercy, he causes it to find its mark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"Pay attention to this, Job! Stand still and consider the wonders God works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Do you know how God commands them, how he makes lightning flash in his storm cloud?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Do you know about the balancing of the clouds, that wondrous activity of him who is perfect in knowledge?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You, whose garments are hot when the earth is still because of the south wind,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">will you, with him, spread out the clouds, solid as a mirror of molten metal?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Tell us what we should say to him. We cannot prepare a case because of the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Should he be informed that I want to speak? If a man speaks, surely he would be swallowed up!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But now, the sun cannot be looked at - it is bright in the skies - after a wind passed and swept the clouds away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">From the north he comes in golden splendor; around God is awesome majesty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As for the Almighty, we cannot attain to him! He is great in power, but justice and abundant righteousness he does not oppress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore people fear him, for he does not regard all the wise in heart."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> answered Job out of the whirlwind:</VERS>
