    <subject />
    <description>The NET Bible®, First Edition, is a completely new translation of the Bible (several millions of dollars, thousands of hrs volunteer labor across 10 yrs), not a revision or an update of a previous English version but was translated by biblical scholars who worked directly from the best currently available Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts The NET Bible®, contains over 63,000 notes. These notes are not like those in other bibles as has been attested to by bible scholars, Christian leaders, , pastors, lay leaders, and missionaries e.g. Kenneth L. Barker  General Editor,  NIV Study Bible and TNIV Study Bible says "The translators' notes, study notes, and text-critical notes alone are worth the price of the NET Bible®. Wayne Grudem a Member, Translation Oversight Committee, ESV said, "The extensive and reliable notes in the NET Bible® were a wonderful help to our translation team as we worked to prepare the English Standard Version."  Charles Swindoll radio host of Insight for Living says, "The NET Bible® is a Bible you can trust. The translation is clear, accurate, and powerful. And the notes, those wonderful notes! They bring to the layman scholarly insights and discussions that have up till now been accessible only to those trained in the biblical languages. If you are serious about studying Scripture, get a copy of the NET Bible®." Dr. Tony Evans Senior Pastor and the host of The Urban Alternative, radio broadcast, says, "The complaint I hear from many Christians is that some of the translations of the Bible are too wooden. They are grammatically correct, but don't seem to convey the passion of the writer. On the flip side, some paraphrases and translations convey the passion of the writer at the cost of an accurate translation. The NET Bible® is the best of both worlds. The notes are helpful to the scholar and the layperson alike. This is the Bible for the next millennium.... " See other endorsements at http://www.bible.org/endorsements.

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="1" bname="Genesis" bsname="Gen">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now the earth was without shape and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the watery deep, but the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">God said, "Let there be light." And there was light!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God saw that the light was good, so God separated the light from the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God called the light "day" and the darkness "night." There was evening, and there was morning, marking the first day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters and let it separate water from water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. It was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">God called the expanse "sky." There was evening, and there was morning, a second day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place and let dry ground appear." It was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God called the dry ground "land" and the gathered waters he called "seas." God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: plants yielding seeds according to their kinds, and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds." It was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The land produced vegetation - plants yielding seeds according to their kinds, and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There was evening, and there was morning, a third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them be signs to indicate seasons and days and years,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and let them serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth." It was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">God made two great lights - the greater light to rule over the day and the lesser light to rule over the night. He made the stars also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">God placed the lights in the expanse of the sky to shine on the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">to preside over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">There was evening, and there was morning, a fourth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">God said, "Let the water swarm with swarms of living creatures and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">God created the great sea creatures and every living and moving thing with which the water swarmed, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">There was evening, and there was morning, a fifth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: cattle, creeping things, and wild animals, each according to its kind." It was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the cattle according to their kinds, and all the creatures that creep along the ground according to their kinds. God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then God said, "Let us make humankind in our image, after our likeness, so they may rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move on the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">God created humankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them, male and female he created them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply! Fill the earth and subdue it! Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and every creature that moves on the ground."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then God said, "I now give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the entire earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And to all the animals of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to all the creatures that move on the ground - everything that has the breath of life in it - I give every green plant for food." It was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">God saw all that he had made - and it was very good! There was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The heavens and the earth were completed with everything that was in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">By the seventh day God finished the work that he had been doing, and he ceased on the seventh day all the work that he had been doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it he ceased all the work that he had been doing in creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">This is the account of the heavens andthe earth when they were created - when the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God made the earth and heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now no shrub of the field had yet grown on the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Springs would well up from the earth and water the whole surface of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God formed the man from the soil of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God planted an orchard in the east, in Eden; and there he placed the man he had formed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God made all kinds of trees grow from the soil, every tree that was pleasing to look at and good for food. (Now the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil were in the middle of the orchard.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now a river flows from Eden towater the orchard, and from there it divides into four headstreams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of the first is Pishon; it runs through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">(The gold of that land is pure; pearls and lapis lazuli are also there).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The name of the second river is Gihon; it runs through the entire land of Cush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The name of the third river is Tigris; it runs along the east side of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God took the man and placed him in the orchard in Eden to care for it and to maintain it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God commanded the man, "You may freely eat fruit from every tree of the orchard,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will surely die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a companion for him who corresponds to him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God formed out of the ground every living animal of the field and every bird of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them, and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the man named all the animals, the birds of the air, and the living creatures of the field, but for Adam no companion who corresponded to him was found.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he was asleep, he took part of the man's side and closed up the place with flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God made a woman from the part he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then the man said,"This one at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; this one will be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">That is why a man leaves his father and mother and unites with his wife, and they become a new family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The man and his wife were both naked, but they were not ashamed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the serpent was more shrewd than any of the wild animals that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God had made. He said to the woman, "Is it really true that God said, 'You must not eat from any tree of the orchard'?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit from the trees of the orchard;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but concerning the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the orchard God said, 'You must not eat from it, and you must not touch it, or else you will die.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The serpent said to the woman, "Surely you will not die,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will open and you will be like divine beings who know good and evil."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the woman saw that the tree produced fruit that was good for food, was attractive to the eye, and was desirable for making one wise, she took some of its fruit and ate it. She also gave some of it to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then the eyes of both of them opened, and they knew they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God moving about in the orchard at the breezy time of the day, and they hid from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God among the trees of the orchard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God called to the man and said to him, "Where are you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The man replied, "I heard you moving about in the orchard, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God said, "Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The man said, "The woman whom you gave me, she gave me some fruit from the tree and I ate it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" And the woman replied, "The serpent tricked me, and I ate."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all the wild beasts and all the living creatures of the field! On your belly you will crawl and dust you will eat all the days of your life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I will put hostility between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring; her offspring will attack your head, and you will attack her offspring's heel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To the woman he said, "I will greatly increase your labor pains; with pain you will give birth to children. You will want to control your husband, but he will dominate you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But to Adam he said, "Because you obeyed your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,' cursed is the ground thanks to you; in painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">It will produce thorns and thistles for you, but you will eat the grain of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">By the sweat of your brow you will eat food until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you will return."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all the living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God made garments from skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God said, "Now that the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil, he must not be allowed to stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God expelled him from the orchard in Eden to cultivate the ground from which he had been taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When he drove the man out, he placed on the eastern side of the orchard in Eden angelic sentries who used the flame of a whirling sword to guard the way to the tree of life.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the man had marital relations with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. Then she said, "I have created a man just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> did!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then she gave birth to his brother Abel. Abel took care of the flocks, while Cain cultivated the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">At the designated time Cain brought some of the fruit of the ground for an offering to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Abel brought some of the firstborn of his flock - even the fattest of them. And the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was pleased with Abel and his offering,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but with Cain and his offering he was not pleased. So Cain became very angry, and his expression was downcast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why is your expression downcast?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Is it not true that if you do what is right, you will be fine? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door. It desires to dominate you, but you must subdue it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" And he replied, "I don't know! Am I my brother's guardian?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So now, you are banished from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When you try to cultivate theground it will no longer yield its best for you. You will be a homeless wanderer on the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Cain said to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "My punishment is too great to endure!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Look! You are driving me off the land today, and I must hide from your presence. I will be a homeless wanderer on the earth; whoever finds me will kill me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to him, "All right then, if anyone kills Cain, Cain will be avenged seven times as much." Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> put a special mark on Cain so that no one who found him would strike him down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Cain went out from the presence of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Cain had marital relations with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was building a city, and he named the city after his son Enoch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael. Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Lamech took two wives for himself; the name of the first was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the first of those who live in tents and keep livestock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The name of his brother was Jubal; he was the first of all who play the harp and the flute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-Cain, who heated metal and shaped all kinds of tools made of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Lamech said to his wives,"Adah and Zillah! Listen to me! You wives of Lamech, hear my words! I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for hurting me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If Cain is to be avenged seven times as much, then Lamech seventy-seven times!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Adam had marital relations with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son. She named him Seth, saying, "God has given me another child in place of Abel because Cain killed him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And a son was also born to Seth, whom he named Enosh. At that time people began to worship the LORD.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">This is the record of the family line of Adam.When God created humankind, he made them in the likeness of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he journeyed from place to place from the Negev as far as Bethel. He returned to the place where he had pitched his tent at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">This was the place where he had first built the altar, and there Abram worshiped the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks, herds, and tents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the land could not support them while they were living side by side. Because their possessions were so great, they were not able to live alongside one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So there were quarrels between Abram's herdsmen and Lot's herdsmen. (Now the Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land at that time.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no quarreling between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are close relatives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself now from me. If you go to the left, then I'll go to the right, but if you go to the right, then I'll go to the left."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Lot looked up and saw the whole region of the Jordan. He noticed that all of it was well-watered (before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> obliterated Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, like the land of Egypt, all the way to Zoar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Lot chose for himself the whole region of the Jordan and traveled toward the east.So the relatives separated from each other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Abram settled in the land of Canaan, but Lot settled among the cities of the Jordan plain and pitched his tents next to Sodom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">(Now the people of Sodom were extremely wicked rebels against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">After Lot had departed, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Abram, "Look from the place where you stand to the north, south, east, and west.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I will give all the land that you see to you and your descendants forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone is able to count the dust of the earth, then your descendants also can be counted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Get up and walk throughout the land, for I will give it to you."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Abram said to Sarai, "Since your servant is under your authority, do to her whatever you think best." Then Sarai treated Hagar harshly, so she ran away from Sarai.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Abraham ran to the herd and chose a fine, tender calf, and gave it to a servant, who quickly prepared it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But he urged them persistently, so they turned aside with him and entered his house. He prepared a feast for them, including bread baked without yeast, and they ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Before they could lie down to sleep, all the men - both young and old, from every part of the city of Sodom - surrounded the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They shouted to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them!"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">So the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house as they shut the door.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> rained down sulfur and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah. It was sent down from the sky by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So he overthrew those cities and all that region, including all the inhabitants of the cities and the vegetation that grew from the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But Lot's wife looked back longingly and was turned into a pillar of salt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of that region. As he did so, he saw the smoke rising up from the land like smoke from a furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So when God destroyed the cities of the region, God honored Abraham's request. He removed Lot from the midst of the destruction when he destroyed the cities Lot had lived in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Lot went up from Zoar with his two daughters and settled in the mountains because he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Later the older daughter said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is no man anywhere nearby to have sexual relations with us, according to the way of all the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Come, let's make our father drunk with wine so we can have sexual relations with him and preserve our family line through our father."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So that night they made their father drunk with wine, and the older daughter came and had sexual relations with her father. But he was not aware that she had sexual relations with him and then got up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">So in the morning the older daughter said to the younger, "Since I had sexual relations with my father last night, let's make him drunk again tonight. Then you go and have sexual relations with him so we can preserve our family line through our father."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So they made their father drunk that night as well, and the younger one came and had sexual relations with him. But he was not aware that she had sexual relations with him and then got up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">In this way both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The older daughter gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the ancestor of the Moabites of today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-Ammi. He is the ancestor of the Ammonites of today.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Abraham journeyed from there to the Negev region and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he lived as a temporary resident in Gerar,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Abraham said about his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent for Sarah and took her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But God appeared to Abimelech in a dream at night and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is someone else's wife."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now Abimelech had not gone near her. He said, "Lord, would you really slaughter an innocent nation?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Did Abraham not say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' I have done this with a clear conscience and with innocent hands!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then in the dream God replied to him, "Yes, I know that you have done this with a clear conscience. That is why I have kept you from sinning against me and why I did not allow you to touch her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But now give back the man's wife. Indeed he is a prophet and he will pray for you; thus you will live. But if you don't give her back, know that you will surely die along with all who belong to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Early in the morning Abimelech summoned all his servants. When he told them about all these things, they were terrified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? What sin did I commit against you that would cause you to bring such great guilt on me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Abimelech asked Abraham, "What prompted you to do this thing?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Abraham replied, "Because I thought, 'Surely no one fears God in this place. They will kill me because of my wife.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">What's more, she is indeed my sister, my father's daughter, but not my mother's daughter. She became my wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When God made me wander from my father's house, I told her, 'This is what you can do to show your loyalty to me: Every place we go, say about me, "He is my brother."'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So Abimelech gave sheep, cattle, and male and female servants to Abraham. He also gave his wife Sarah back to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Abimelech said, "Look, my land is before you; live wherever you please."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To Sarah he said, "Look, I have given a thousand pieces of silver to your 'brother.' This is compensation for you so that you will stand vindicated before all who are with you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, as well as his wife and female slaves so that they were able to have children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the LORD had caused infertility to strike every woman in the household of Abimelech because he took Sarah, Abraham's wife.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> visited Sarah just as he had said he would and did for Sarah what he had promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So Sarah became pregnant and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the appointed time that God had told him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Abraham named his son - whom Sarah bore to him - Isaac.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him just as God had commanded him to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">(Now Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sarah said, "God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears about this will laugh with me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">She went on to say, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have given birth to a son for him in his old age!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The child grew and was weaned. Abraham prepared a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Sarah noticed the son of Hagar the Egyptian - the son whom Hagar had borne to Abraham - mocking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So she said to Abraham, "Banish that slave woman and her son, for the son of that slave woman will not be an heir along with my son Isaac!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Sarah's demand displeased Abraham greatly because Ishmael was his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But God said to Abraham, "Do not be upset about the boy or your slave wife. Do all that Sarah is telling you because through Isaac your descendants will be counted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But I will also make the son of the slave wife into a great nation, for he is your descendant too."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Early in the morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He put them on her shoulders, gave her the child, and sent her away. So she went wandering aimlessly through the wilderness of Beer Sheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When the water in the skin was gone, she shoved the child under one of the shrubs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then she went and sat down by herself across from him at quite a distance, about a bowshot away; for she thought, "I refuse to watch the child die." So she sat across from him and wept uncontrollably.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But God heard the boy's voice. The angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and asked her, "What is the matter, Hagar? Don't be afraid, for God has heard the boy's voice right where he is crying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Get up! Help the boy up and hold him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then God enabled Hagar to see a well of water. She went over and filled the skin with water, and then gave the boy a drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">God was with the boy as he grew. He lived in the wilderness and became an archer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother found a wife for him from the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">At that time Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, "God is with you in all that you do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now swear to me right here in God's name that you will not deceive me, my children, or my descendants. Show me, and the land where you are staying, the same loyalty that I have shown you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Abraham said, "I swear to do this."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Abraham lodged a complaint against Abimelech concerning a well that Abimelech's servants had seized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">"I do not know who has done this thing," Abimelech replied. "Moreover, you did not tell me. I did not hear about it until today."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Abraham took some sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech. The two of them made a treaty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs apart from the flock by themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Abimelech asked Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He replied, "You must take these seven ewe lambs from my hand as legal proof that I dug this well."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">That is why he named that place Beer Sheba, because the two of them swore an oath there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So they made a treaty at Beer Sheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, returned to the land of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer Sheba. There he worshiped the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, the eternal God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Some time after these things God tested Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!" "Here I am!" Abraham replied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God said, "Take your son - your only son, whom you love, Isaac - and go to the land of Moriah! Offer him up there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will indicate to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Early in the morning Abraham got up and saddled his donkey. He took two of his young servants with him, along with his son Isaac. When he had cut the wood for the burnt offering, he started out for the place God had spoken to him about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">On the third day Abraham caught sight of the place in the distance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he said to his servants, "You two stay here with the donkey while the boy and I go up there. We will worship and then return to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and put it on his son Isaac. Then he took the fire and the knife in his hand, and the two of them walked on together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Isaac said to his father Abraham, "My father?" "What is it, my son?" he replied. "Here is the fire and the wood," Isaac said, "but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"God will provide for himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son," Abraham replied. The two of them continued on together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they came to the place God had told him about, Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood on it. Next he tied up his son Isaac and placed him on the altar on top of the wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Abraham reached out his hand, took the knife, and prepared to slaughter his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the Lord's angel called to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!" "Here I am!" he answered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"Do not harm the boy!" the angel said. "Do not do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God because you did not withhold your son, your only son, from me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Abraham looked up and saw behind him a ram caught in the bushes by its horns. So he went over and got the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Abraham called the name of that place "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> provides." It is said to this day, "In the mountain of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> provision will be made."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s angel called to Abraham a second time from heaven</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">The sons of Heth answered Abraham,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Abraham got up and bowed down to the local people, the sons of Heth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then he said to them, "If you agree that I may bury my dead, then hear me out. Ask Ephron the son of Zohar</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">So Abraham agreed to Ephron's price and weighed out for him the price that Ephron had quoted in the hearing of the sons of Heth - 400 pieces of silver, according to the standard measurement at the time.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years, and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had blessed him in everything.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="63">He went out to relax in the field in the early evening. Then he looked up and saw that there were camels approaching.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a famine in the land, subsequent to the earlier famine that occurred in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> appeared to Isaac and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; settle down in the land that I will point out to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Stay in this land. Then I will be with you and will bless you, for I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants, and I will fulfill the solemn promise I made to your father Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I will multiply your descendants so they will be as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give them all these lands. All the nations of the earth will pronounce blessings on one another using the name of your descendants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">All this will come to pass because Abraham obeyed me and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Isaac settled in Gerar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he replied, "She is my sister." He was afraid to say, "She is my wife," for he thought to himself, "The men of this place will kill me to get Rebekah because she is very beautiful."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">After Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines happened to look out a window and observed Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, "She is really your wife! Why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac replied, "Because I thought someone might kill me to get her."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Abimelech exclaimed, "What in the world have you done to us? One of the men might easily have had sexual relations with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So Abimelech commanded all the people, "Whoever touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When Isaac planted in that land, he reaped in the same year a hundred times what he had sown, because the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> blessed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The man became wealthy. His influence continued to grow until he became very prominent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He had so many sheep and cattle and such a great household of servants that the Philistines became jealous of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the Philistines took dirt and filled up all the wells that his father's servants had dug back in the days of his father Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Abimelech said to Isaac, "Leave us and go elsewhere, for you have become much more powerful than we are."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So Isaac left there and settled in the Gerar Valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug back in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after Abraham died. Isaac gave these wells the same names his father had given them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When Isaac's servants dug in the valley and discovered a well with fresh flowing water there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, "The water belongs to us!" So Isaac named the well Esek because they argued with him about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">His servants dug another well, but they quarreled over it too, so Isaac named it Sitnah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then he moved away from there and dug another well. They did not quarrel over it, so Isaac named it Rehoboth, saying, "For now the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has made room for us, and we will prosper in the land."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">From there Isaac went up to Beer Sheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> appeared to him that night and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. He pitched his tent there, and his servants dug a well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now Abimelech had come to him from Gerar along with Ahuzzah his friend and Phicol the commander of his army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Isaac asked them, "Why have you come to me? You hate me and sent me away from you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They replied, "We could plainly see that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is with you. So we decided there should be a pact between us - between us and you. Allow us to make a treaty with you</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">so that you will not do us any harm, just as we have not harmed you, but have always treated you well before sending you away in peace. Now you are blessed by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So Isaac held a feast for them and they celebrated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Early in the morning the men made a treaty with each other. Isaac sent them off; they separated on good terms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">That day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well they had dug. "We've found water," they reported.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So he named it Shibah; that is why the name of the city has been Beer Sheba to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, as well as Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">They caused Isaac and Rebekah great anxiety.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he was almost blind, he called his older son Esau and said to him, "My son!" "Here I am!" Esau replied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Isaac said, "Since I am so old, I could die at any time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore, take your weapons - your quiver and your bow - and go out into the open fields and hunt down some wild game for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then prepare for me some tasty food, the kind I love, and bring it to me. Then I will eat it so that I may bless you before I die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Rebekah had been listening while Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau went out to the open fields to hunt down some wild game and bring it back,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "Look, I overheard your father tell your brother Esau,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">'Bring me some wild game and prepare for me some tasty food. Then I will eat it and bless you in the presence of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> before I die.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now then, my son, do exactly what I tell you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Go to the flock and get me two of the best young goats. I'll prepare them in a tasty way for your father, just the way he loves them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then you will take it to your father. Thus he will eat it and bless you before he dies."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"But Esau my brother is a hairy man," Jacob protested to his mother Rebekah, "and I have smooth skin!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">My father may touch me! Then he'll think I'm mocking him and I'll bring a curse on myself instead of a blessing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So his mother told him, "Any curse against you will fall on me, my son! Just obey me! Go and get them for me!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So he went and got the goats and brought them to his mother. She prepared some tasty food, just the way his father loved it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Rebekah took her older son Esau's best clothes, which she had with her in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">She put the skins of the young goats on his hands and the smooth part of his neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then she handed the tasty food and the bread she had made to her son Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He went to his father and said, "My father!" Isaac replied, "Here I am. Which are you, my son?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau, your firstborn. I've done as you told me. Now sit up and eat some of my wild game so that you can bless me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Isaac asked his son, "How in the world did you find it so quickly, my son?" "Because the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God brought it to me," he replied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Come closer so I can touch you, my son, and know for certain if you really are my son Esau."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Jacob went over to his father Isaac, who felt him and said, "The voice is Jacob's, but the hands are Esau's."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He did not recognize him because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau's hands. So Isaac blessed Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then he asked, "Are you really my son Esau?" "I am," Jacob replied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Isaac said, "Bring some of the wild game for me to eat, my son. Then I will bless you." So Jacob brought it to him, and he ate it. He also brought him wine, and Isaac drank.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come here and kiss me, my son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So Jacob went over and kissed him. When Isaac caught the scent of his clothing, he blessed him, saying,"Yes, my son smells like the scent of an open field which the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has blessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">May God give you the dew of the sky and the richness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">May peoples serve you and nations bow down to you. You will be lord over your brothers, and the sons of your mother will bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed, and those who bless you be blessed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Isaac had just finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely left his father's presence, when his brother Esau returned from the hunt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He also prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Esau said to him, "My father, get up and eat some of your son's wild game. Then you can bless me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">His father Isaac asked, "Who are you?" "I am your firstborn son," he replied, "Esau!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Isaac began to shake violently and asked, "Then who else hunted game and brought it to me? I ate all of it just before you arrived, and I blessed him. He will indeed be blessed!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When Esau heard his father's words, he wailed loudly and bitterly. He said to his father, "Bless me too, my father!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But Isaac replied, "Your brother came in here deceitfully and took away your blessing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Esau exclaimed, "'Jacob' is the right name for him! He has tripped me up two times! He took away my birthright, and now, look, he has taken away my blessing!" Then he asked, "Have you not kept back a blessing for me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Isaac replied to Esau, "Look! I have made him lord over you. I have made all his relatives his servants and provided him with grain and new wine. What is left that I can do for you, my son?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Esau said to his father, "Do you have only that one blessing, my father? Bless me too!" Then Esau wept loudly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">So his father Isaac said to him,"Indeed, your home will be away from the richness of the earth, and away from the dew of the sky above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">You will live by your sword but you will serve your brother. When you grow restless, you will tear off his yoke from your neck."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">So Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing his father had given to his brother. Esau said privately, "The time of mourning for my father is near; then I will kill my brother Jacob!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">When Rebekah heard what her older son Esau had said, she quickly summoned her younger son Jacob and told him, "Look, your brother Esau is planning to get revenge by killing you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Now then, my son, do what I say. Run away immediately to my brother Laban in Haran.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Live with him for a little while until your brother's rage subsides.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Stay there until your brother's anger against you subsides and he forgets what you did to him. Then I'll send someone to bring you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am deeply depressed because of these daughters of Heth. If Jacob were to marry one of these daughters of Heth who live in this land, I would want to die!"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him, "You must not marry a Canaanite woman!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Leave immediately for Paddan Aram! Go to the house of Bethuel, your mother's father, and find yourself a wife there, among the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">May the sovereign God bless you! May he make you fruitful and give you a multitude of descendants! Then you will become a large nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">May he give you and your descendants the blessing he gave to Abraham so that you may possess the land God gave to Abraham, the land where you have been living as a temporary resident."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean and brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him off to Paddan Aram to find a wife there. As he blessed him, Isaac commanded him, "You must not marry a Canaanite woman."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jacob obeyed his father and mother and left for Paddan Aram.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Esau realized that the Canaanite women were displeasing to his father Isaac.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Esau went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Abraham's son Ishmael, along with the wives he already had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Meanwhile Jacob left Beer Sheba and set out for Haran.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He reached a certain place where he decided to camp because the sun had gone down. He took one of the stones and placed it near his head. Then he fell asleep in that place</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and had a dream. He saw a stairway erected on the earth with its top reaching to the heavens. The angels of God were going up and coming down it</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> stood at its top. He said, "I am the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, the God of your grandfather Abraham and the God of your father Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the ground you are lying on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west, east, north, and south. All the families of the earth will pronounce blessings on one another using your name and that of your descendants.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Jacob woke up and thought, "Surely the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is in this place, but I did not realize it!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He was afraid and said, "What an awesome place this is! This is nothing else than the house of God! This is the gate of heaven!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Early in the morning Jacob took the stone he had placed near his head and set it up as a sacred stone. Then he poured oil on top of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He called that place Bethel, although the former name of the town was Luz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God is with me and protects me on this journey I am taking and gives me food to eat and clothing to wear,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and I return safely to my father's home, then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will become my God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then this stone that I have set up as a sacred stone will be the house of God, and I will surely give you back a tenth of everything you give me."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="29">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So Jacob moved on and came to the land of the eastern people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He saw in the field a well with three flocks of sheep lying beside it, because the flocks were watered from that well. Now a large stone covered the mouth of the well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone off the mouth of the well and water the sheep. Then they would put the stone back in its place over the well's mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jacob asked them, "My brothers, where are you from?" They replied, "We're from Haran."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he said to them, "Do you know Laban, the grandson of Nahor?" "We know him," they said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"Is he well?" Jacob asked. They replied, "He is well. Now look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Jacob said, "Since it is still the middle of the day, it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. You should water the sheep and then go and let them graze some more."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"We can't," they said, "until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled off the mouth of the well. Then we water the sheep."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father's sheep, for she was tending them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his uncle Laban, and the sheep of his uncle Laban, he went over and rolled the stone off the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of his uncle Laban.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep loudly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When Jacob explained to Rachel that he was a relative of her father and the son of Rebekah, she ran and told her father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Laban heard this news about Jacob, his sister's son, he rushed out to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban how he was related to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Laban said to him, "You are indeed my own flesh and blood." So Jacob stayed with him for a month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Laban said to Jacob, "Should you work for me for nothing because you are my relative? Tell me what your wages should be."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">(Now Laban had two daughters; the older one was named Leah, and the younger one Rachel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Leah's eyes were tender, but Rachel had a lovely figure and beautiful appearance.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Since Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel, he said, "I'll serve you seven years in exchange for your younger daughter Rachel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Laban replied, "I'd rather give her to you than to another man. Stay with me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So Jacob worked for seven years to acquire Rachel. But they seemed like only a few days to him because his love for her was so great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Finally Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my time of service is up. I want to have marital relations with her."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Laban invited all the people of that place and prepared a feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In the evening he brought his daughter Leah to Jacob, and Jacob had marital relations with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">(Laban gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">In the morning Jacob discovered it was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, "What in the world have you done to me! Didn't I work for you in exchange for Rachel? Why have you tricked me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">"It is not our custom here," Laban replied, "to give the younger daughter in marriage before the firstborn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Complete my older daughter's bridal week. Then we will give you the younger one too, in exchange for seven more years of work."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Jacob did as Laban said. When Jacob completed Leah's bridal week, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">(Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jacob had marital relations with Rachel as well. He loved Rachel more than Leah, so he worked for Laban for seven more years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> saw that Leah was unloved, he enabled her to become pregnant while Rachel remained childless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has looked with pity on my oppressed condition. Surely my husband will love me now."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">She became pregnant again and had another son. She said, "Because the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> heard that I was unloved, he gave me this one too." So she named him Simeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">She became pregnant again and had another son. She said, "Now this time my husband will show me affection, because I have given birth to three sons for him." That is why he was named Levi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">She became pregnant again and had another son. She said, "This time I will praise the LORD." That is why she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="30">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Rachel saw that she could not give Jacob children, she became jealous of her sister. She said to Jacob, "Give me children or I'll die!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jacob became furious with Rachel and exclaimed, "Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">She replied, "Here is my servant Bilhah! Have sexual relations with her so that she can bear children for me and I can have a family through her."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So Rachel gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob had marital relations with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Bilhah became pregnant and gave Jacob a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Rachel said, "God has vindicated me. He has responded to my prayer and given me a son." That is why she named him Dan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Bilhah, Rachel's servant, became pregnant again and gave Jacob another son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Rachel said, "I have fought a desperate struggle with my sister, but I have won." So she named him Naphtali.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she gave her servant Zilpah to Jacob as a wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Soon Leah's servant Zilpah gave Jacob a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Leah said, "How fortunate!" So she named him Gad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Leah's servant Zilpah gave Jacob another son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Leah said, "How happy I am, for women will call me happy!" So she named him Asher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">At the time of the wheat harvest Reuben went out and found some mandrake plants in a field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, "Give me some of your son's mandrakes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Leah replied, "Wasn't it enough that you've taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes too?" "All right," Rachel said, "he may sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must sleep with me because I have paid for your services with my son's mandrakes." So he had marital relations with her that night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">God paid attention to Leah; she became pregnant and gave Jacob a son for the fifth time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Leah said, "God has granted me a reward because I gave my servant to my husband as a wife." So she named him Issachar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Leah became pregnant again and gave Jacob a son for the sixth time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Leah said, "God has given me a good gift. Now my husband will honor me because I have given him six sons." So she named him Zebulun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">After that she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then God took note of Rachel. He paid attention to her and enabled her to become pregnant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. Then she said, "God has taken away my shame."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">She named him Joseph, saying, "May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> give me yet another son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">After Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me on my way so that I can go home to my own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Let me take my wives and my children whom I have acquired by working for you. Then I'll depart, because you know how hard I've worked for you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Laban said to him, "If I have found favor in your sight, please stay here, for I have learned by divination that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has blessed me on account of you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He added, "Just name your wages - I'll pay whatever you want."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">"You know how I have worked for you," Jacob replied, "and how well your livestock have fared under my care.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Indeed, you had little before I arrived, but now your possessions have increased many times over. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has blessed you wherever I worked. But now, how long must it be before I do something for my own family too?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So Laban asked, "What should I give you?" "You don't need to give me a thing," Jacob replied, "but if you agree to this one condition, I will continue to care for your flocks and protect them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Let me walk among all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb, and the spotted or speckled goats. These animals will be my wages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">My integrity will testify for me later on. When you come to verify that I've taken only the wages we agreed on, if I have in my possession any goat that is not speckled or spotted or any sheep that is not dark-colored, it will be considered stolen."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">"Agreed!" said Laban, "It will be as you say."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So that day Laban removed the male goats that were streaked or spotted, all the female goats that were speckled or spotted (all that had any white on them), and all the dark-colored lambs, and put them in the care of his sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then he separated them from Jacob by a three-day journey, while Jacob was taking care of the rest of Laban's flocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Jacob took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond, and plane trees. He made white streaks by peeling them, making the white inner wood in the branches visible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then he set up the peeled branches in all the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. He set up the branches in front of the flocks when they were in heat and came to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When the sheep mated in front of the branches, they gave birth to young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jacob removed these lambs, but he made the rest of the flock face the streaked and completely dark-colored animals in Laban's flock. So he made separate flocks for himself and did not mix them with Laban's flocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">When the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would set up the branches in the troughs in front of the flock, so they would mate near the branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But if the animals were weaker, he did not set the branches there. So the weaker animals ended up belonging to Laban and the stronger animals to Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">In this way Jacob became extremely prosperous. He owned large flocks, male and female servants, camels, and donkeys.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="31">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jacob heard that Laban's sons were complaining, "Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father! He has gotten rich at our father's expense!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When Jacob saw the look on Laban's face, he could tell his attitude toward him had changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives. I will be with you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So Jacob sent a message for Rachel and Leah to come to the field where his flocks were.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There he said to them, "I can tell that your father's attitude toward me has changed, but the God of my father has been with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You know that I've worked for your father as hard as I could,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but your father has humiliated me and changed my wages ten times. But God has not permitted him to do me any harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If he said, 'The speckled animals will be your wage,' then the entire flock gave birth to speckled offspring. But if he said, 'The streaked animals will be your wage,' then the entire flock gave birth to streaked offspring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In this way God has snatched away your father's livestock and given them to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"Once during breeding season I saw in a dream that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled, and spotted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In the dream the angel of God said to me, 'Jacob!' 'Here I am!' I replied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then he said, 'Observe that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled, or spotted, for I have observed all that Laban has done to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the sacred stone and made a vow to me. Now leave this land immediately and return to your native land.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Rachel and Leah replied to him, "Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father's house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Hasn't he treated us like foreigners? He not only sold us, but completely wasted the money paid for us!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Surely all the wealth that God snatched away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So now do everything God has told you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So Jacob immediately put his children and his wives on the camels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He took away all the livestock he had acquired in Paddan Aram and all his moveable property that he had accumulated. Then he set out toward the land of Canaan to return to his father Isaac.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">While Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole the household idols that belonged to her father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jacob also deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was leaving.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He left with all he owned. He quickly crossed the Euphrates River and headed for the hill country of Gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Three days later Laban discovered Jacob had left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So he took his relatives with him and pursued Jacob for seven days. He caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and warned him, "Be careful that you neither bless nor curse Jacob."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Laban overtook Jacob, and when Jacob pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead, Laban and his relatives set up camp there too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">"What have you done?" Laban demanded of Jacob. "You've deceived me and carried away my daughters as if they were captives of war!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Why did you run away secretly and deceive me? Why didn't you tell me so I could send you off with a celebration complete with singing, tambourines, and harps?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">You didn't even allow me to kiss my daughters and my grandchildren good-bye. You have acted foolishly!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I have the power to do you harm, but the God of your father told me last night, 'Be careful that you neither bless nor curse Jacob.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now I understand that you have gone away because you longed desperately for your father's house. Yet why did you steal my gods?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">"I left secretly because I was afraid!" Jacob replied to Laban. "I thought you might take your daughters away from me by force.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Whoever has taken your gods will be put to death! In the presence of our relatives identify whatever is yours and take it." (Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Laban entered Jacob's tent, and Leah's tent, and the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find the idols. Then he left Leah's tent and entered Rachel's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">(Now Rachel had taken the idols and put them inside her camel's saddle and sat on them.) Laban searched the whole tent, but did not find them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord. I cannot stand up in your presence because I am having my period." So he searched thoroughly, but did not find the idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jacob became angry and argued with Laban. "What did I do wrong?" he demanded of Laban. "What sin of mine prompted you to chase after me in hot pursuit?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">When you searched through all my goods, did you find anything that belonged to you? Set it here before my relatives and yours, and let them settle the dispute between the two of us!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">"I have been with you for the past twenty years. Your ewes and female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Animals torn by wild beasts I never brought to you; I always absorbed the loss myself. You always made me pay for every missing animal, whether it was taken by day or at night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">I was consumed by scorching heat during the day and by piercing cold at night, and I went without sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">This was my lot for twenty years in your house: I worked like a slave for you - fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, but you changed my wages ten times!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">If the God of my father - the God of Abraham, the one whom Isaac fears - had not been with me, you would certainly have sent me away empty-handed! But God saw how I was oppressed and how hard I worked, and he rebuked you last night."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Laban replied to Jacob, "These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren, and these flocks are my flocks. All that you see belongs to me. But how can I harm these daughters of mine today or the children to whom they have given birth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">So now, come, let's make a formal agreement, you and I, and it will be proof that we have made peace."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a memorial pillar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then he said to his relatives, "Gather stones." So they brought stones and put them in a pile. They ate there by the pile of stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Laban said, "This pile of stones is a witness of our agreement today." That is why it was called Galeed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">It was also called Mizpah because he said, "May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> watch between us when we are out of sight of one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">If you mistreat my daughters or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one else is with us, realize that God is witness to your actions."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">"Here is this pile of stones and this pillar I have set up between me and you," Laban said to Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">"This pile of stones and the pillar are reminders that I will not pass beyond this pile to come to harm you and that you will not pass beyond this pile and this pillar to come to harm me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">May the God of Abraham and the god of Nahor, the gods of their father, judge between us." Jacob took an oath by the God whom his father Isaac feared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his relatives to eat the meal. They ate the meal and spent the night on the mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Early in the morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters goodbye and blessed them. Then Laban left and returned home.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="32">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When Jacob saw them, he exclaimed, "This is the camp of God!" So he named that place Mahanaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jacob sent messengers on ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the region of Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He commanded them, "This is what you must say to my lord Esau: 'This is what your servant Jacob says: I have been staying with Laban until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I have oxen, donkeys, sheep, and male and female servants. I have sent this message to inform my lord, so that I may find favor in your sight.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The messengers returned to Jacob and said, "We went to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you and has four hundred men with him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jacob was very afraid and upset. So he divided the people who were with him into two camps, as well as the flocks, herds, and camels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"If Esau attacks one camp," he thought, "then the other camp will be able to escape."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, you said to me, 'Return to your land and to your relatives and I will make you prosper.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I am not worthy of all the faithful love you have shown your servant. With only my walking stick I crossed the Jordan, but now I have become two camps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Rescue me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, as well as the mothers with their children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But you said, 'I will certainly make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand on the seashore, too numerous to count.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jacob stayed there that night. Then he sent as a gift to his brother Esau</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He entrusted them to his servants, who divided them into herds. He told his servants, "Pass over before me, and keep some distance between one herd and the next."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He instructed the servant leading the first herd, "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'To whom do you belong? Where are you going? Whose herds are you driving?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">then you must say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They have been sent as a gift to my lord Esau. In fact Jacob himself is behind us.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He also gave these instructions to the second and third servants, as well as all those who were following the herds, saying, "You must say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You must also say, 'In fact your servant Jacob is behind us.'" Jacob thought, "I will first appease him by sending a gift ahead of me. After that I will meet him. Perhaps he will accept me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So the gifts were sent on ahead of him while he spent that night in the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">During the night Jacob quickly took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He took them and sent them across the stream along with all his possessions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So Jacob was left alone. Then a man wrestled with him until daybreak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When the man saw that he could not defeat Jacob, he struck the socket of his hip so the socket of Jacob's hip was dislocated while he wrestled with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then the man said, "Let me go, for the dawn is breaking." "I will not let you go," Jacob replied, "unless you bless me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The man asked him, "What is your name?" He answered, "Jacob."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">"No longer will your name be Jacob," the man told him, "but Israel, because you have fought with God and with men and have prevailed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Jacob asked, "Please tell me your name." "Why do you ask my name?" the man replied. Then he blessed Jacob there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So Jacob named the place Peniel, explaining, "Certainly I have seen God face to face and have survived."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The sun rose over him as he crossed over Penuel, but he was limping because of his hip.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">That is why to this day the Israelites do not eat the sinew which is attached to the socket of the hip, because he struck the socket of Jacob's hip near the attached sinew.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="33">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jacob looked up and saw that Esau was coming along with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two female servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He put the servants and their children in front, with Leah and her children behind them, and Rachel and Joseph behind them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Jacob himself went on ahead of them, and he bowed toward the ground seven times as he approached his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, hugged his neck, and kissed him. Then they both wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, he asked, "Who are these people with you?" Jacob replied, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The female servants came forward with their children and bowed down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Leah came forward with her children and they bowed down. Finally Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Esau then asked, "What did you intend by sending all these herds to meet me?" Jacob replied, "To find favor in your sight, my lord."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Esau said, "I have plenty, my brother. Keep what belongs to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"No, please take them," Jacob said. "If I have found favor in your sight, accept my gift from my hand. Now that I have seen your face and you have accepted me, it is as if I have seen the face of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Please take my present that was brought to you, for God has been generous to me and I have all I need." When Jacob urged him, he took it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Esau said, "Let's be on our way! I will go in front of you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are young, and that I have to look after the sheep and cattle that are nursing their young. If they are driven too hard for even a single day, all the animals will die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let my lord go on ahead of his servant. I will travel more slowly, at the pace of the herds and the children, until I come to my lord at Seir."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So Esau said, "Let me leave some of my men with you." "Why do that?" Jacob replied. "My lord has already been kind enough to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So that same day Esau made his way back to Seir.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jacob traveled to Succoth where he built himself a house and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place was called Succoth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">After he left Paddan Aram, Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he camped near the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then he purchased the portion of the field where he had pitched his tent; he bought it from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">There he set up an altar and called it "The God of Israel is God."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Jacob's sons had come in from the field when they heard the news. They were offended and very angry because Shechem had disgraced Israel by sexually assaulting Jacob's daughter, a crime that should not be committed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Hamor made this appeal to them: "My son Shechem is in love with your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Intermarry with us. Let us marry your daughters, and take our daughters as wives for yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You may live among us, and the land will be open to you. Live in it, travel freely in it, and acquire property in it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Shechem said to Dinah's father and brothers, "Let me find favor in your sight, and whatever you require of me I'll give.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You can make the bride price and the gift I must bring very expensive, and I'll give whatever you ask of me. Just give me the young woman as my wife!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jacob's sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully when they spoke because Shechem had violated their sister Dinah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They said to them, "We cannot give our sister to a man who is not circumcised, for it would be a disgrace to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We will give you our consent on this one condition: You must become like us by circumcising all your males.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then we will give you our daughters to marry, and we will take your daughters as wives for ourselves, and we will live among you and become one people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if you do not agree to our terms by being circumcised, then we will take our sister and depart."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">"These men are at peace with us. So let them live in the land and travel freely in it, for the land is wide enough for them. We will take their daughters for wives, and we will give them our daughters to marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Only on this one condition will these men consent to live with us and become one people: They demand that every male among us be circumcised just as they are circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If we do so, won't their livestock, their property, and all their animals become ours? So let's consent to their demand, so they will live among us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">All the men who assembled at the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem. Every male who assembled at the city gate was circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">In three days, when they were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took his sword and went to the unsuspecting city and slaughtered every male.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, took Dinah from Shechem's house, and left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Jacob's sons killed them and looted the city because their sister had been violated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They took their flocks, herds, and donkeys, as well as everything in the city and in the surrounding fields.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They captured as plunder all their wealth, all their little ones, and their wives, including everything in the houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought ruin on me by making me a foul odor among the inhabitants of the land - among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number; they will join forces against me and attack me, and both I and my family will be destroyed!"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">This is the account of Jacob.Joseph, his seventeen-year-old son, was taking care of the flocks with his brothers. Now he was a youngster working with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons because he was a son born to him late in life, and he made a special tunic for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When Joseph's brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated Joseph and were not able to speak to him kindly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Joseph had a dream, and when he told his brothers about it, they hated him even more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He said to them, "Listen to this dream I had:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">When he told his father and his brothers, his father rebuked him, saying, "What is this dream that you had? Will I, your mother, and your brothers really come and bow down to you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept in mind what Joseph said.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">So they took Joseph's tunic, killed a young goat, and dipped the tunic in the blood.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">He turned aside to her along the road and said, "Come on! I want to have sex with you." (He did not realize it was his daughter-in-law.) She asked, "What will you give me in exchange for having sex with you?"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Judah recognized them and said, "She is more upright than I am, because I wouldn't give her to Shelah my son." He did not have sexual relations with her again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When it was time for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But he refused, saying to his master's wife, "Look, my master does not give any thought to his household with me here, and everything that he owns he has put into my care.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There is no one greater in this household than I am. He has withheld nothing from me except you because you are his wife. So how could I do such a great evil and sin against God?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Even though she continued to speak to Joseph day after day, he did not respond to her invitation to have sex with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">One day he went into the house to do his work when none of the household servants were there in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She grabbed him by his outer garment, saying, "Have sex with me!" But he left his outer garment in her hand and ran outside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When she saw that he had left his outer garment in her hand and had run outside,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things happened, the cupbearer to the king of Egypt and the royal baker offended their master, the king of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Pharaoh was enraged with his two officials, the cupbearer and the baker,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">so he imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard in the same facility where Joseph was confined.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be their attendant, and he served them. They spent some time in custody.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Both of them, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, had a dream the same night. Each man's dream had its own meaning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were looking depressed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So he asked Pharaoh's officials, who were with him in custody in his master's house, "Why do you look so sad today?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They told him, "We both had dreams, but there is no one to interpret them." Joseph responded, "Don't interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph: "In my dream, there was a vine in front of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On the vine there were three branches. As it budded, its blossoms opened and its clusters ripened into grapes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, so I took the grapes, squeezed them into his cup, and put the cup in Pharaoh's hand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"This is its meaning," Joseph said to him. "The three branches represent three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In three more days Pharaoh will reinstate you and restore you to your office. You will put Pharaoh's cup in his hand, just as you did before when you were cupbearer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But remember me when it goes well for you, and show me kindness. Make mention of me to Pharaoh and bring me out of this prison,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">for I really was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews and I have done nothing wrong here for which they should put me in a dungeon."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When the chief baker saw that the interpretation of the first dream was favorable, he said to Joseph, "I also appeared in my dream and there were three baskets of white bread on my head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In the top basket there were baked goods of every kind for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them from the basket that was on my head."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Joseph replied, "This is its meaning: The three baskets represent three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In three more days Pharaoh will decapitate you and impale you on a pole. Then the birds will eat your flesh from you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">On the third day it was Pharaoh's birthday, so he gave a feast for all his servants. He "lifted up" the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker in the midst of his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He restored the chief cupbearer to his former position so that he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="41">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At the end of two full years Pharaoh had a dream. As he was standing by the Nile,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">seven fine-looking, fat cows were coming up out of the Nile, and they grazed in the reeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then seven bad-looking, thin cows were coming up after them from the Nile, and they stood beside the other cows at the edge of the river.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The bad-looking, thin cows ate the seven fine-looking, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then he fell asleep again and had a second dream: There were seven heads of grain growing on one stalk, healthy and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then seven heads of grain, thin and burned by the east wind, were sprouting up after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The thin heads swallowed up the seven healthy and full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up and realized it was a dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In the morning he was troubled, so he called for all the diviner-priests of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, "Today I recall my failures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Pharaoh was enraged with his servants, and he put me in prison in the house of the captain of the guards - me and the chief baker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We each had a dream one night; each of us had a dream with its own meaning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now a young man, a Hebrew, a servant of the captain of the guards, was with us there. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted the meaning of each of our respective dreams for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">It happened just as he had said to us - Pharaoh restored me to my office, but he impaled the baker."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Pharaoh summoned Joseph. So they brought him quickly out of the dungeon; he shaved himself, changed his clothes, and came before Pharaoh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. But I have heard about you, that you can interpret dreams."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Joseph replied to Pharaoh, "It is not within my power, but God will speak concerning the welfare of Pharaoh."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream I was standing by the edge of the Nile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then seven fat and fine-looking cows were coming up out of the Nile, and they grazed in the reeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then seven other cows came up after them; they were scrawny, very bad-looking, and lean. I had never seen such bad-looking cows as these in all the land of Egypt!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The lean, bad-looking cows ate up the seven fat cows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When they had eaten them, no one would have known that they had done so, for they were just as bad-looking as before. Then I woke up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">I also saw in my dream seven heads of grain growing on one stalk, full and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then seven heads of grain, withered and thin and burned with the east wind, were sprouting up after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. So I told all this to the diviner-priests, but no one could tell me its meaning."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "Both dreams of Pharaoh have the same meaning. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The seven good cows represent seven years, and the seven good heads of grain represent seven years. Both dreams have the same meaning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The seven lean, bad-looking cows that came up after them represent seven years, as do the seven empty heads of grain burned with the east wind. They represent seven years of famine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">This is just what I told Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the whole land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But seven years of famine will occur after them, and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will devastate the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The previous abundance of the land will not be remembered because of the famine that follows, for the famine will be very severe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The dream was repeated to Pharaoh because the matter has been decreed by God, and God will make it happen soon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">"So now Pharaoh should look for a wise and discerning man and give him authority over all the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Pharaoh should do this - he should appoint officials throughout the land to collect one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">They should gather all the excess food during these good years that are coming. By Pharaoh's authority they should store up grain so the cities will have food, and they should preserve it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This food should be held in storage for the land in preparation for the seven years of famine that will occur throughout the land of Egypt. In this way the land will survive the famine."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">This advice made sense to Pharaoh and all his officials.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So Pharaoh asked his officials, "Can we find a man like Joseph, one in whom the Spirit of God is present?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Because God has enabled you to know all this, there is no one as wise and discerning as you are!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">You will oversee my household, and all my people will submit to your commands. Only I, the king, will be greater than you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">"See here," Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I place you in authority over all the land of Egypt."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his own hand and put it on Joseph's. He clothed him with fine linen clothes and put a gold chain around his neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Pharaoh had him ride in the chariot used by his second-in-command, and they cried out before him, "Kneel down!" So he placed him over all the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Pharaoh also said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, but without your permission no one will move his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah. He also gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. So Joseph took charge of all the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Now Joseph was 30 years old when he began serving Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph was commissioned by Pharaoh and was in charge of all the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">During the seven years of abundance the land produced large, bountiful harvests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Joseph collected all the excess food in the land of Egypt during the seven years and stored it in the cities. In every city he put the food gathered from the fields around it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Joseph stored up a vast amount of grain, like the sand of the sea, until he stopped measuring it because it was impossible to measure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Two sons were born to Joseph before the famine came. Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, was their mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, saying, "Certainly God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's house."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">He named the second child Ephraim, saying, "Certainly God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">The seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Then the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had predicted. There was famine in all the other lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">When all the land of Egypt experienced the famine, the people cried out to Pharaoh for food. Pharaoh said to all the people of Egypt, "Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">While the famine was over all the earth, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians. The famine was severe throughout the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">People from every country came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain because the famine was severe throughout the earth.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="42">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jacob heard there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why are you looking at each other?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He then said, "Look, I hear that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy grain for us so that we may live and not die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Jacob did not send Joseph's brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, "What if some accident happens to him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Israel's sons came to buy grain among the other travelers, for the famine was severe in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now Joseph was the ruler of the country, the one who sold grain to all the people of the country. Joseph's brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger to them and spoke to them harshly. He asked, "Where do you come from?" They answered, "From the land of Canaan, to buy grain for food."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Joseph remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them, and he said to them, "You are spies; you have come to see if our land is vulnerable!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But they exclaimed, "No, my lord! Your servants have come to buy grain for food!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We are all the sons of one man; we are honest men! Your servants are not spies."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"No," he insisted, "but you have come to see if our land is vulnerable."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They replied, "Your servants are from a family of twelve brothers. We are the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is with our father at this time, and one is no longer alive."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Joseph told them, "It is just as I said to you: You are spies!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You will be tested in this way: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not depart from this place unless your youngest brother comes here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">One of you must go and get your brother, while the rest of you remain in prison. In this way your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If not, then, as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He imprisoned them all for three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">On the third day Joseph said to them, "Do as I say and you will live, for I fear God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If you are honest men, leave one of your brothers confined here in prison while the rest of you go and take grain back for your hungry families.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But you must bring your youngest brother to me. Then your words will be verified and you will not die." They did as he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They said to one other, "Surely we're being punished because of our brother, because we saw how distressed he was when he cried to us for mercy, but we refused to listen. That is why this distress has come on us!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Reuben said to them, "Didn't I say to you, 'Don't sin against the boy,' but you wouldn't listen? So now we must pay for shedding his blood!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">(Now they did not know that Joseph could understand them, for he was speaking through an interpreter.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He turned away from them and wept. When he turned around and spoke to them again, he had Simeon taken from them and tied up before their eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to return each man's money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. His orders were carried out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey at their resting place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He said to his brothers, "My money was returned! Here it is in my sack!" They were dismayed; they turned trembling one to another and said, "What in the world has God done to us?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They returned to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan and told him all the things that had happened to them, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">"The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and treated us as if we were spying on the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we are not spies!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">"Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'This is how I will find out if you are honest men. Leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for your hungry households and go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But bring your youngest brother back to me so I will know that you are honest men and not spies. Then I will give your brother back to you and you may move about freely in the land.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When they were emptying their sacks, there was each man's bag of money in his sack! When they and their father saw the bags of money, they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Their father Jacob said to them, "You are making me childless! Joseph is gone. Simeon is gone. And now you want to take Benjamin! Everything is against me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then Reuben said to his father, "You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my care and I will bring him back to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Jacob replied, "My son will not go down there with you, for his brother is dead and he alone is left. If an accident happens to him on the journey you have to make, then you will bring down my gray hair in sorrow to the grave."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="43">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the famine was severe in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When they finished eating the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Return, buy us a little more food."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Judah said to him, "The man solemnly warned us, 'You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If you send our brother with us, we'll go down and buy food for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if you will not send him, we won't go down there because the man said to us, 'You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Israel said, "Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had one more brother?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They replied, "The man questioned us thoroughly about ourselves and our family, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' So we answered him in this way. How could we possibly know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Judah said to his father Israel, "Send the boy with me and we will go immediately. Then we will live and not die - we and you and our little ones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I myself pledge security for him; you may hold me liable. If I do not bring him back to you and place him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if we had not delayed, we could have traveled there and back twice by now!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be so, then do this: Take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and take a gift down to the man - a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachios and almonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Take double the money with you; you must take back the money that was returned in the mouths of your sacks - perhaps it was an oversight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Take your brother too, and go right away to the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">May the sovereign God grant you mercy before the man so that he may release your other brother and Benjamin! As for me, if I lose my children I lose them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the men took these gifts, and they took double the money with them, along with Benjamin. Then they hurried down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the servant who was over his household, "Bring the men to the house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for the men will eat with me at noon."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The man did just as Joseph said; he brought the men into Joseph's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the men were afraid when they were brought to Joseph's house. They said, "We are being brought in because of the money that was returned in our sacks last time. He wants to capture us, make us slaves, and take our donkeys!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So they approached the man who was in charge of Joseph's household and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">They said, "My lord, we did indeed come down the first time to buy food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when we came to the place where we spent the night, we opened our sacks and each of us found his money - the full amount - in the mouth of his sack. So we have returned it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">We have brought additional money with us to buy food. We do not know who put the money in our sacks!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">"Everything is fine," the man in charge of Joseph's household told them. "Don't be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks. I had your money." Then he brought Simeon out to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The servant in charge brought the men into Joseph's house. He gave them water, and they washed their feet. Then he gave food to their donkeys.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They got their gifts ready for Joseph's arrival at noon, for they had heard that they were to have a meal there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When Joseph came home, they presented him with the gifts they had brought inside, and they bowed down to the ground before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He asked them how they were doing. Then he said, "Is your aging father well, the one you spoke about? Is he still alive?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">"Your servant our father is well," they replied. "He is still alive." They bowed down in humility.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When Joseph looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, he said, "Is this your youngest brother, whom you told me about?" Then he said, "May God be gracious to you, my son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Joseph hurried out, for he was overcome by affection for his brother and was at the point of tears. So he went to his room and wept there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then he washed his face and came out. With composure he said, "Set out the food."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They set a place for him, a separate place for his brothers, and another for the Egyptians who were eating with him. (The Egyptians are not able to eat with Hebrews, for the Egyptians think it is disgusting to do so.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They sat before him, arranged by order of birth, beginning with the firstborn and ending with the youngest. The men looked at each other in astonishment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He gave them portions of the food set before him, but the portion for Benjamin was five times greater than the portions for any of the others. They drank with Joseph until they all became drunk.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">When morning came, the men and their donkeys were sent off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They had not gone very far from the city when Joseph said to the servant who was over his household, "Pursue the men at once! When you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid good with evil?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">They answered him, "Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Look, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. Why then would we steal silver or gold from your master's house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If one of us has it, he will die, and the rest of us will become my lord's slaves!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He replied, "You have suggested your own punishment! The one who has it will become my slave, but the rest of you will go free."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the man searched. He began with the oldest and finished with the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin's sack!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They all tore their clothes! Then each man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So Judah and his brothers came back to Joseph's house. He was still there, and they threw themselves to the ground before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Joseph said to them, "What did you think you were doing? Don't you know that a man like me can find out things like this by divination?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Judah replied, "What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? How can we clear ourselves? God has exposed the sin of your servants! We are now my lord's slaves, we and the one in whose possession the cup was found."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Joseph said, "Far be it from me to do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found will become my slave, but the rest of you may go back to your father in peace."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Judah approached him and said, "My lord, please allow your servant to speak a word with you. Please do not get angry with your servant, for you are just like Pharaoh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My lord asked his servants, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We said to my lord, 'We have an aged father, and there is a young boy who was born when our father was old. The boy's brother is dead. He is the only one of his mother's sons left, and his father loves him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">"Then you told your servants, 'Bring him down to me so I can see him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">We said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father. If he leaves his father, his father will die.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But you said to your servants, 'If your youngest brother does not come down with you, you will not see my face again.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When we returned to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">"Then our father said, 'Go back and buy us a little food.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But we replied, 'We cannot go down there. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go, for we won't be permitted to see the man's face if our youngest brother is not with us.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">"Then your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife gave me two sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The first disappeared and I said, "He has surely been torn to pieces." I have not seen him since.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">If you take this one from me too and an accident happens to him, then you will bring down my gray hair in tragedy to the grave.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">"So now, when I return to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us - his very life is bound up in his son's life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When he sees the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father in sorrow to the grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Indeed, your servant pledged security for the boy with my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him back to you, then I will bear the blame before my father all my life.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">"So now, please let your servant remain as my lord's slave instead of the boy. As for the boy, let him go back with his brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I couldn't bear to see my father's pain."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Joseph was no longer able to control himself before all his attendants, so he cried out, "Make everyone go out from my presence!" No one remained with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He wept loudly; the Egyptians heard it and Pharaoh's household heard about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?" His brothers could not answer him because they were dumbfounded before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Joseph said to his brothers, "Come closer to me," so they came near. Then he said, "I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now, do not be upset and do not be angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me ahead of you to preserve life!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For these past two years there has been famine in the land and for five more years there will be neither plowing nor harvesting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">God sent me ahead of you to preserve you on the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So now, it is not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me an adviser to Pharaoh, lord over all his household, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now go up to my father quickly and tell him, 'This is what your son Joseph says: "God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not delay!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">So tell my father about all my honor in Egypt and about everything you have seen. But bring my father down here quickly!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then he threw himself on the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He kissed all his brothers and wept over them. After this his brothers talked with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now it was reported in the household of Pharaoh, "Joseph's brothers have arrived." It pleased Pharaoh and his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers, 'Do this: Load your animals and go to the land of Canaan!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Get your father and your households and come to me! Then I will give you the best land in Egypt and you will eat the best of the land.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Don't worry about your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt will be yours.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So the sons of Israel did as he said. Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had instructed, and he gave them provisions for the journey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He gave sets of clothes to each one of them, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">To his father he sent the following: ten donkeys loaded with the best products of Egypt and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, food, and provisions for his father's journey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then he sent his brothers on their way and they left. He said to them, "As you travel don't be overcome with fear."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So they went up from Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They told him, "Joseph is still alive and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!" Jacob was stunned, for he did not believe them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when they related to him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to transport him, their father Jacob's spirit revived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Israel said, "Enough! My son Joseph is still alive! I will go and see him before I die."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Joseph also provided food for his father, his brothers, and all his father's household, according to the number of their little children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But there was no food in all the land because the famine was very severe; the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan wasted away because of the famine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Joseph collected all the money that could be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan as payment for the grain they were buying. Then Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When the money from the lands of Egypt and Canaan was used up, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, "Give us food! Why should we die before your very eyes because our money has run out?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Joseph said, "If your money is gone, bring your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for their horses, the livestock of their flocks and herds, and their donkeys. He got them through that year by giving them food in exchange for livestock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When that year was over, they came to him the next year and said to him, "We cannot hide from our lord that the money is used up and the livestock and the animals belong to our lord. Nothing remains before our lord except our bodies and our land.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. Each of the Egyptians sold his field, for the famine was severe. So the land became Pharaoh's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Joseph made all the people slaves from one end of Egypt's border to the other end of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But he did not purchase the land of the priests because the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh and they ate from their allotment that Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Joseph said to the people, "Since I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you. Cultivate the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When you gather in the crop, give one-fifth of it to Pharaoh, and the rest will be yours for seed for the fields and for you to eat, including those in your households and your little children."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They replied, "You have saved our lives! You are showing us favor, and we will be Pharaoh's slaves."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So Joseph made it a statute, which is in effect to this day throughout the land of Egypt: One-fifth belongs to Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they owned land there. They were fruitful and increased rapidly in number.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">The time for Israel to die approached, so he called for his son Joseph and said to him, "If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh and show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place." Joseph said, "I will do as you say."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jacob said, "Swear to me that you will do so." So Joseph gave him his word. Then Israel bowed down at the head of his bed.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="48">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Joseph was told, "Your father is weakening." So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When Jacob was told, "Your son Joseph has just come to you," Israel regained strength and sat up on his bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jacob said to Joseph, "The sovereign God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He said to me, 'I am going to make you fruitful and will multiply you. I will make you into a group of nations, and I will give this land to your descendants as an everlasting possession.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he asked, "Who are these?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Joseph said to his father, "They are the sons God has given me in this place." His father said, "Bring them to me so I may bless them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now Israel's eyes were failing because of his age; he was not able to see well. So Joseph brought his sons near to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see you again, but now God has allowed me to see your children too."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Joseph moved them from Israel's knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Joseph positioned them; he put Ephraim on his right hand across from Israel's left hand, and Manasseh on his left hand across from Israel's right hand. Then Joseph brought them closer to his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Israel stretched out his right hand and placed it on Ephraim's head, although he was the younger. Crossing his hands, he put his left hand on Manasseh's head, for Manasseh was the firstborn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then he blessed Joseph and said, "May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked - the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">the Angel who has protected me from all harm - bless these boys. May my name be named in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. May they grow into a multitude on the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When Joseph saw that his father placed his right hand on Ephraim's head, it displeased him. So he took his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He too will become a nation and he too will become great. In spite of this, his younger brother will be even greater and his descendants will become a multitude of nations."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So he blessed them that day, saying,"By you will Israel bless, saying, 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.'" So he put Ephraim before Manasseh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Israel said to Joseph, "I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your fathers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Then he instructed them, "I am about to go to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">It is the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought for a burial plot from Ephron the Hittite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah; there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah; and there I buried Leah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The field and the cave in it were acquired from the sons of Heth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When Jacob finished giving these instructions to his sons, he pulled his feet up onto the bed, breathed his last breath, and went to his people.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="50">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Joseph hugged his father's face. He wept over him and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Joseph instructed the physicians in his service to embalm his father, so the physicians embalmed Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They took forty days, for that is the full time needed for embalming. The Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh's royal court, "If I have found favor in your sight, please say to Pharaoh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">'My father made me swear an oath. He said, "I am about to die. Bury me in my tomb that I dug for myself there in the land of Canaan." Now let me go and bury my father; then I will return.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Pharaoh said, "Go and bury your father, just as he made you swear to do."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Joseph went up to bury his father; all Pharaoh's officials went with him - the senior courtiers of his household, all the senior officials of the land of Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">all Joseph's household, his brothers, and his father's household. But they left their little children and their flocks and herds in the land of Goshen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Chariots and horsemen also went up with him, so it was a very large entourage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they came to the threshing floor of Atad on the other side of the Jordan, they mourned there with very great and bitter sorrow. There Joseph observed a seven day period of mourning for his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When the Canaanites who lived in the land saw them mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "This is a very sad occasion for the Egyptians." That is why its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the sons of Jacob did for him just as he had instructed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">His sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, near Mamre. This is the field Abraham purchased as a burial plot from Ephron the Hittite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">After he buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, along with his brothers and all who had accompanied him to bury his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph bears a grudge and wants to repay us in full for all the harm we did to him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So they sent word to Joseph, saying, "Your father gave these instructions before he died:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">'Tell Joseph this: Please forgive the sin of your brothers and the wrong they did when they treated you so badly.' Now please forgive the sin of the servants of the God of your father." When this message was reported to him, Joseph wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then his brothers also came and threw themselves down before him; they said, "Here we are; we are your slaves."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Joseph answered them, "Don't be afraid. Am I in the place of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As for you, you meant to harm me, but God intended it for a good purpose, so he could preserve the lives of many people, as you can see this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So now, don't be afraid. I will provide for you and your little children." Then he consoled them and spoke kindly to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Joseph lived in Egypt, along with his father's family. Joseph lived 110 years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Joseph saw the descendants of Ephraim to the third generation. He also saw the children of Makir the son of Manasseh; they were given special inheritance rights by Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die. But God will surely come to you and lead you up from this land to the land he swore on oath to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath. He said, "God will surely come to you. Then you must carry my bones up from this place."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So Joseph died at the age of 110. After they embalmed him, his body was placed in a coffin in Egypt.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">These  are the names of the sons of Israel who entered Egypt - each man with his household entered with Jacob:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">All the people who were directly descended from Jacob numbered seventy. But Joseph was already in Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and in time Joseph and his brothers and all that generation died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Israelites, however, were fruitful, increased greatly, multiplied, and became extremely strong,  so that the land was filled with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power over Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said to his people, "Look at the Israelite people, more numerous and stronger than we are!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Come, let's deal wisely with them. Otherwise they will continue to multiply, and if a war breaks out, they will ally themselves with our enemies and fight against us and leave the country."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So they put foremen over the Israelites to oppress them with hard labor. As a result they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more they multiplied and spread. As a result the Egyptians loathed the Israelites,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and they made the Israelites serve rigorously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They made their lives bitter by hard service with mortar and bricks and by all kinds of service  in the fields. Every kind of service the Israelites were required to give was rigorous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"When you assist the Hebrew women in childbirth, observe at the delivery: If it is a son, kill him, but if it is a daughter, she may live."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But the midwives feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them; they let the boys live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, "Why have you done this and let the boys live?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women - for the Hebrew women are vigorous; they give birth before the midwife gets to them!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So God treated the midwives well, and the people multiplied and became very strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And because the midwives feared God, he made households for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, "All sons that are born you must throw into the river, but all daughters you may let live."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">A man from the household of Levi married a woman who was a descendant of Levi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a healthy child, she hid him for three months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But when she was no longer able to hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him and sealed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and set it among the reeds along the edge of the Nile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">His sister stationed herself at a distance to find out what would happen to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself by the Nile, while her attendants were walking alongside the river, and she saw the basket among the reeds. She sent one of her attendants, took it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">opened it, and saw the child - a boy, crying! - and she felt compassion for him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get a nursing woman for you from the Hebrews, so that she may nurse the child for you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Yes, do so." So the young girl went and got the child's mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay your wages." So the woman took the child and nursed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When the child grew older she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, "Because I drew him from the water."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and observed their hard labor, and he saw an Egyptian man attacking a Hebrew man, one of his own people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He looked this way and that and saw that no one was there, and then he attacked the Egyptian and concealed the body in the sand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When he went out the next day, there were two Hebrew men fighting. So he said to the one who was in the wrong, "Why are you attacking your fellow Hebrew?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The man replied, "Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? Are you planning to kill me like you killed that Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid, thinking, "Surely what I did has become known."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When Pharaoh heard about this event, he sought to kill Moses. So Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, and he settled by a certain well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and began to draw water and fill the troughs in order to water their father's flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When some shepherds came and drove them away, Moses came up and defended them and then watered their flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So when they came home to their father Reuel, he asked, "Why have you come home so early today?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They said, "An Egyptian man rescued us from the shepherds, and he actually drew water for us and watered the flock!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said to his daughters, "So where is he? Why in the world did you leave the man? Call him, so that he may eat a meal with us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When she bore a son, Moses named him Gershom, for he said, "I have become a resident foreigner in a foreign land."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">During that long period of time the king of Egypt died, and the Israelites groaned because of the slave labor. They cried out, and their desperate cry because of their slave labor went up to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God heard their groaning, God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">God saw the Israelites, and God understood....</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The angel of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> appeared to him in a flame of fire from within a bush. He looked - and the bush was ablaze with fire, but it was not being consumed!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Moses thought, "I will turn aside to see this amazing sight. Why does the bush not burn up?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him from within the bush and said, "Moses, Moses!" And Moses said, "Here I am."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God said, "Do not approach any closer! Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He added, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Then Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt. I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And now indeed the cry of the Israelites has come to me, and I have also seen how severely the Egyptians oppress them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So now go, and I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, or that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He replied, "Surely I will be with you, and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: When you bring the people out of Egypt, you and they will serve God on this mountain."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Moses said to God, "If I go to the Israelites and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' - what should I say to them?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">God said to Moses, "I am that I am." And he said, "You must say this to the Israelites, 'I am has sent me to you.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">God also said to Moses, "You must say this to the Israelites, 'The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> - the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob - has sent me to you.

      <VERS vnumber="19">But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, not even under force.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So I will extend my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders that I will do among them, and after that he will release you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">When the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, "What is it?" because they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has given you for food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has commanded: 'Each person is to gather from it what he can eat, an omer per person according to the number of your people; each one will pick it up for whoever lives in his tent.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The Israelites did so, and they gathered - some more, some less.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they measured with an omer, the one who gathered much had nothing left over, and the one who gathered little lacked nothing; each one had gathered what he could eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moses said to them, "No one is to keep any of it until morning."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But they did not listen to Moses; some kept part of it until morning, and it was full of worms and began to stink, and Moses was angry with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So they gathered it each morning, each person according to what he could eat, and when the sun got hot, it would melt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And on the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, two omers per person; and all the leaders of the community came and told Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said to them, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has said: 'Tomorrow is a time of cessation from work, a holy Sabbath to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.

      <VERS vnumber="24">So they put it aside until the morning, just as Moses had commanded, and it did not stink, nor were there any worms in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Moses said, "Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>; today you will not find it in the area.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Six days you will gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather it, but they found nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to obey my commandments and my instructions?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">So the people rested on the seventh day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The house of Israel called its name "manna." It was like coriander seed and was white, and it tasted like wafers with honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Moses said, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has commanded: 'Fill an omer with it to be kept for generations to come, so that they may see the food I fed you in the desert when I brought you out from the land of Egypt.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put in it an omer full of manna, and place it before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> to be kept for generations to come."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the Testimony for safekeeping.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="32">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When the people saw that Moses delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said to him, "Get up, make us gods that will go before us. As for this fellow Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So Aaron said to them, "Break off the gold earrings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So all the people broke off the gold earrings that were on their ears and brought them to Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He accepted the gold from them, fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made a molten calf. Then they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it, and Aaron made a proclamation and said, "Tomorrow will be a feast to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So they got up early on the next day and offered up burnt offerings and brought peace offerings, and the people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to Moses: "Go quickly, descend, because your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have acted corruptly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They have quickly turned aside from the way that I commanded them - they have made for themselves a molten calf and have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, which brought you up from the land of Egypt.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Moses: "I have seen this people. Look what a stiff-necked people they are!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So now, leave me alone so that my anger can burn against them and I can destroy them, and I will make from you a great nation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Moses sought the favor of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> his God and said, "O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, why does your anger burn against your people, whom you have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Why should the Egyptians say, 'For evil he led them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth'? Turn from your burning anger, and relent of this evil against your people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel your servants, to whom you swore by yourself and told them, 'I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken about I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> relented over the evil that he had said he would do to his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hands. The tablets were written on both sides - they were written on the front and on the back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "It is the sound of war in the camp!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Moses said, "It is not the sound of those who shout for victory, nor is it the sound of those who cry because they are overcome, but the sound of singing I hear."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When he approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses became extremely angry. He threw the tablets from his hands and broke them to pieces at the bottom of the mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire, ground it to powder, poured it out on the water, and made the Israelites drink it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you, that you have brought on them so great a sin?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Aaron said, "Do not let your anger burn hot, my lord; you know these people, that they tend to evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They said to me, 'Make us gods that will go before us, for as for this fellow Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So I said to them, 'Whoever has gold, break it off.' So they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Moses saw that the people were running wild, for Aaron had let them get completely out of control, causing derision from their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So Moses stood at the entrance of the camp and said, "Whoever is for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, come to me." All the Levites gathered around him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and he said to them, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, 'Each man fasten his sword on his side, and go back and forth from entrance to entrance throughout the camp, and each one kill his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The Levites did what Moses ordered, and that day about three thousand men of the people died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Moses said, "You have been consecrated today for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, for each of you was against his son or against his brother, so he has given a blessing to you today."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a very serious sin, but now I will go up to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> - perhaps I can make atonement on behalf of your sin."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So Moses returned to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and said, "Alas, this people has committed a very serious sin, and they have made for themselves gods of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But now, if you will forgive their sin..., but if not, wipe me out from your book that you have written."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me - that person I will wipe out of my book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">So now go, lead the people to the place I have spoken to you about. See, my angel will go before you. But on the day that I punish, I will indeed punish them for their sin."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the LORD sent a plague on the people because they had made the calf - the one Aaron made.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="33">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Moses, "Go up from here, you and the people whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go up among you, for you are a stiff-necked people, and I might destroy you on the way."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the people heard this troubling word they mourned; no one put on his ornaments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I went up among you for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments, that I may know what I should do to you.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments by Mount Horeb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Moses took the tent and pitched it outside the camp, at a good distance from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting. Anyone seeking the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> would go out to the tent of meeting that was outside the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Moses went out to the tent, all the people would get up and stand at the entrance to their tents and watch Moses until he entered the tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> would speak with Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When all the people would see the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people, each one at the entrance of his own tent, would rise and worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> would speak to Moses face to face, the way a person speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his servant, Joshua son of Nun, a young man, did not leave the tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Moses said to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "See, you have been saying to me, 'Bring this people up,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. But you said, 'I know you by name, and also you have found favor in my sight.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now if I have found favor in your sight, show me your way, that I may know you, that I may continue to find favor in your sight. And see that this nation is your people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Moses said to him, "If your presence does not go with us, do not take us up from here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For how will it be known then that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Is it not by your going with us, so that we will be distinguished, I and your people, from all the people who are on the face of the earth?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Moses, "I will do this thing also that you have requested, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Moses said, "Show me your glory."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "I will make all my goodness pass before your face, and I will proclaim the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> by name before you; I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But he added, "You cannot see my face, for no one can see me and live."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "Here is a place by me; you will station yourself on a rock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and will cover you with my hand while I pass by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back, but my face must not be seen."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="34">

      <VERS vnumber="5">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> by name.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Next he presented the grain offering, filled his hand with some of it, and offered it up in smoke on the altar in addition to the morning burnt offering.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, each took his fire pan and put fire in it, set incense on it, and presented strange fire before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, which he had not commanded them to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So fire went out from the presence of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and consumed them so that they died before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Moses then said to Aaron, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke: 'Among the ones close to me I will show myself holy, and in the presence of all the people I will be honored.'" So Aaron kept silent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Moses then called to Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and said to them, "Come near, carry your brothers away from the front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his remaining sons, "Take the grain offering which remains from the gifts of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Later Moses sought diligently for the sin offering male goat, but it had actually been burnt. So he became angry at Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's remaining sons, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">"Why did you not eat the sin offering in the sanctuary? For it is most holy and he gave it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement on their behalf before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">See here! Its blood was not brought into the holy place within! You should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary just as I commanded!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Aaron spoke to Moses, "See here!

      <VERS vnumber="20">But he said, "You may not pass through." Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful force.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border; therefore Israel turned away from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the entire company of Israelites traveled from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When the Canaanite king of Arad who lived in the Negev heard that Israel was approaching along the road to Atharim, he fought against Israel and took some of them prisoner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So Israel made a vow to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and said, "If you will indeed deliver this people into our hand, then we will utterly destroy their cities."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> listened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. So the name of the place was called Hormah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then they traveled from Mount Hor by the road to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom, but the people became impatient along the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the people spoke against God and against Moses, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness, for there is no bread or water, and we detest this worthless food."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> sent poisonous snakes among the people, and they bit the people; many people of Israel died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then the people came to Moses and said, "We have sinned, for we have spoken against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and against you. Pray to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> that he would take away the snakes from us." So Moses prayed for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Moses, "Make a poisonous snake and set it on a pole. When anyone who is bitten looks at it, he will live."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">The Israelites traveled on and camped in Oboth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then they traveled on from Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim, in the wilderness that is before Moab, on the eastern side.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">But Sihon did not permit Israel to pass through his border; he gathered all his forces together and went out against Israel into the wilderness. When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the Israelites defeated him in battle and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the Ammonites, for the border of the Ammonites was strongly defended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So Israel took all these cities; and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For Heshbon was the city of King Sihon of the Amorites. Now he had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all of his land from his control, as far as the Arnon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">That is why those who speak in proverbs say,"Come to Heshbon, let it be built. Let the city of Sihon be established!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Woe to you, Moab. You are ruined, O people of Chemosh! He has made his sons fugitives, and his daughters the prisoners of King Sihon of the Amorites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">We have overpowered them; Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon. We have shattered them as far as Nophah, which reaches to Medeba."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So the Israelites lived in the land of the Amorites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Moses sent spies to reconnoiter Jaazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then they turned and went up by the road to Bashan. And King Og of Bashan and all his forces marched out against them to do battle at Edrei.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Moses, "Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand. You will do to him what you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So they defeated Og, his sons, and all his people, until there were no survivors, and they possessed his land.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">So the Moabites said to the elders of Midian, "Now this mass of people will lick up everything around us, as the bull devours the grass of the field. Now Balak son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at this time.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">So now, please come and curse this nation for me, for they are too powerful for me. Perhaps I will prevail so that we may conquer them and drive them out of the land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Then the angel of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> stood in a path among the vineyards, where there was a wall on either side.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">"If a young woman who is still living in her father's house makes a vow to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> or places herself under an obligation,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">But if her father overrules her when he hears about it, then none of her vows or her obligations which she has pledged for herself will stand. And the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will release her from it, because her father overruled her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"And if she marries a husband while under a vow, or she uttered anything impulsively by which she has pledged herself,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But if when her husband hears it he overrules her, then he will nullify the vow she has taken, and whatever she uttered impulsively which she has pledged for herself. And the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will release her from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">"But every vow of a widow or of a divorced woman which she has pledged for herself will remain intact.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">If she made the vow in her husband's house or put herself under obligation with an oath,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">"Any vow or sworn obligation that would bring affliction to her, her husband can confirm or nullify.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But if her husband remains completely silent about her from day to day, he thus confirms all her vows or all her obligations which she is under; he confirms them because he remained silent about when he heard them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">You must send to the battle a thousand men from every tribe throughout all the tribes of Israel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So a thousand from every tribe, twelve thousand armed for battle in all, were provided out of the thousands of Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">They killed the kings of Midian in addition to those slain - Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba - five Midianite kings. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Israelites took the women of Midian captives along with their little ones, and took all their herds, all their flocks, and all their goods as plunder.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Moses said to them, "Have you allowed all the women to live?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Look, these people through the counsel of Balaam caused the Israelites to act treacherously against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> in the matter of Peor - which resulted in the plague among the community of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now therefore kill every boy, and kill every woman who has had sexual intercourse with a man.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone into the battle, "This is the ordinance of the law that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> commanded Moses:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">You must wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you will be ceremonially clean, and afterward you may enter the camp.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to Moses:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">"You and Eleazar the priest, and all the family leaders of the community, take the sum of the plunder that was captured, both people and animals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Divide the plunder into two parts, one for those who took part in the war - who went out to battle - and the other for all the community.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">"You must exact a tribute for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> from the fighting men who went out to battle: one life out of five hundred, from the people, the cattle, and from the donkeys and the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">You are to take it from their half-share and give it to Eleazar the priest for a raised offering to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> commanded Moses.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="51">Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all of it in the form of ornaments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">All the gold of the offering they offered up to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> from the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds weighed 16,750 shekels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Each soldier had taken plunder for himself.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="32">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Reubenites and the Gadites possessed a very large number of cattle. When they saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were ideal for cattle,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">the Gadites and the Reubenites came and addressed Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community. They said,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">the land that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> subdued before the community of Israel, is ideal for cattle, and your servants have cattle."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So they said, "If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for our inheritance. Do not have us cross the Jordan River."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Moses said to the Gadites and the Reubenites, "Must your brothers go to war while you remain here?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Why do you frustrate the intent of the Israelites to cross over into the land which the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has given them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Your fathers did the same thing when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they went up to the Eshcol Valley and saw the land, they frustrated the intent of the Israelites so that they did not enter the land that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had given them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the anger of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was kindled that day, and he swore,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s anger was kindled against the Israelites, and he made them wander in the wilderness for forty years, until all that generation that had done wickedly before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now look, you are standing in your fathers' place, a brood of sinners, to increase still further the fierce wrath of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> against the Israelites.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Then they came very close to him and said, "We will build sheep folds here for our flocks and cities for our families,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="35">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to Moses in the Moabite plains by the Jordan near Jericho. He said:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Instruct the Israelites to give the Levites towns to live in from the inheritance the Israelites will possess. You must also give the Levites grazing land around the towns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Thus they will have towns in which to live, and their grazing lands will be for their cattle, for their possessions, and for all their animals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The grazing lands around the towns that you will give to the Levites must extend to a distance of 500 yards from the town wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"You must measure from outside the wall of the town on the east 1,000 yards, and on the south side 1,000 yards, and on the west side 1,000 yards, and on the north side 1,000 yards, with the town in the middle. This territory must belong to them as grazing land for the towns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now from these towns that you will give to the Levites you must select six towns of refuge to which a person who has killed someone may flee. And you must give them forty-two other towns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"So the total of the towns you will give the Levites is forty-eight. You must give these together with their grazing lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The towns you will give must be from the possession of the Israelites. From the larger tribes you must give more; and from the smaller tribes fewer. Each must contribute some of its own towns to the Levites in proportion to the inheritance allocated to each.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to Moses:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"Speak to the Israelites and tell them, 'When you cross over the Jordan River into the land of Canaan,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">you must then designate some towns as towns of refuge for you, to which a person who has killed someone unintentionally may flee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they must stand as your towns of refuge from the avenger in order that the killer may not die until he has stood trial before the community.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These towns that you must give shall be your six towns for refuge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"You must give three towns on this side of the Jordan, and you must give three towns in the land of Canaan; they must be towns of refuge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">These six towns will be places of refuge for the Israelites, and for the foreigner, and for the settler among them, so that anyone who kills any person accidentally may flee there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"But if he hits someone with an iron tool so that he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer must surely be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If he strikes him by throwing a stone large enough that he could die, and he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer must surely be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Or if he strikes him with a wooden hand weapon so that he could die, and he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer must surely be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The avenger of blood himself must kill the murderer; when he meets him, he must kill him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">"But if he strikes him suddenly, without enmity, or throws anything at him unintentionally,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">or with any stone large enough that a man could die, without seeing him, and throws it at him, and he dies, even though he was not his enemy nor sought his harm,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">then the community must judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these decisions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The community must deliver the slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the community must restore him to the town of refuge to which he fled, and he must live there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the consecrated oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But if the slayer at any time goes outside the boundary of the town to which he had fled,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and the avenger of blood finds him outside the borders of the town of refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the slayer, he will not be guilty of blood,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">So these things must be a statutory ordinance for you throughout your generations, in all the places where you live.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And you must not accept a ransom for anyone who has fled to a town of refuge, to allow him to return home and live on his own land before the death of the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">"You must not pollute the land where you live, for blood defiles the land, and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed there, except by the blood of the person who shed it.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="36">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the heads of the family groups of the Gileadites, the descendant of Machir, the descendant of Manasseh, who were from the Josephite families, approached and spoke before Moses and the leaders who were the heads of the Israelite families.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They said, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the Israelites; and my lord was commanded by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now if they should be married to one of the men from another Israelite tribe, their inheritance would be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry.

      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the Jubilee of the Israelites is to take place, their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry. So their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our ancestral tribe."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Moses gave a ruling to the Israelites by the word of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>: "What the tribe of the Josephites is saying is right.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">They were married into the families of the Manassehites, the descendants of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of their father's family.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="5" bname="Deuteronomy" bsname="Deu">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">This is what Moses said to the assembly of Israel in the Transjordanian wastelands, the arid country opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di Zahab</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now it is ordinarily an eleven-day journey from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by way of Mount Seir.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">However, it was not until the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year that Moses addressed the Israelites just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had instructed him to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">This took place after the defeat of King Sihon of the Amorites, whose capital was in Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, whose capital was in Ashtaroth, specifically in Edrei.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So it was in the Transjordan, in Moab, that Moses began to deliver these words:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God spoke to us at Horeb and said, "You have stayed in the area of this mountain long enough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Get up now, resume your journey, heading for the Amorite hill country, to all its areas including the arid country, the highlands, the Shephelah, the Negev, and the coastal plain - all of Canaan and Lebanon as far as the Great River, that is, the Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Look! I have already given the land to you. Go, occupy the territory that I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, promised to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I also said to you at that time, "I am no longer able to sustain you by myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God has increased your population to the point that you are now as numerous as the very stars of the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Indeed, may the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, the God of your ancestors, make you a thousand times more numerous than you are now, blessing you just as he said he would!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But how can I alone bear up under the burden of your hardship and strife?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Select wise and practical men, those known among your tribes, whom I may appoint as your leaders."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You replied to me that what I had said to you was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So I chose as your tribal leaders wise and well-known men, placing them over you as administrators of groups of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and also as other tribal officials.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I furthermore admonished your judges at that time that they should pay attention to issues among your fellow citizens and judge fairly, whether between one citizen and another or a citizen and a resident foreigner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They must not discriminate in judgment, but hear the lowly and the great alike. Nor should they be intimidated by human beings, for judgment belongs to God. If the matter being adjudicated is too difficult for them, they should bring it before me for a hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So I instructed you at that time regarding everything you should do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then we left Horeb and passed through all that immense, forbidding wilderness that you saw on the way to the Amorite hill country as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God had commanded us to do, finally arriving at Kadesh Barnea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then I said to you, "You have come to the Amorite hill country which the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God is about to give us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Look, he has placed the land in front of you! Go up, take possession of it, just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, the God of your ancestors, said to do. Do not be afraid or discouraged!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So all of you approached me and said, "Let's send some men ahead of us to scout out the land and bring us back word as to how we should attack it and what the cities are like there."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I thought this was a good idea, so I sent twelve men from among you, one from each tribe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They left and went up to the hill country, coming to the Eshcol Valley, which they scouted out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then they took some of the produce of the land and carried it back down to us. They also brought a report to us, saying, "The land that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God is about to give us is good."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">You were not willing to go up, however, but instead rebelled against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">You complained among yourselves privately and said, "Because the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> hates us he brought us from Egypt to deliver us over to the Amorites so they could destroy us!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">What is going to happen to us? Our brothers have drained away our courage by describing people who are more numerous and taller than we are, and great cities whose defenses appear to be as high as heaven itself! Moreover, they said they saw Anakites there."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So I responded to you, "Do not be terrified of them!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God is about to go ahead of you; he will fight for you, just as you saw him do in Egypt</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and in the desert, where you saw him carrying you along like a man carries his son. This he did everywhere you went until you came to this very place."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">However, through all this you did not have confidence in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">the one who was constantly going before you to find places for you to set up camp. He appeared by fire at night and cloud by day, to show you the way you ought to go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> heard you, he became angry and made this vow:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">"Not a single person of this evil generation will see the good land that I promised to give to your ancestors!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The exception is Caleb son of Jephunneh; he will see it and I will give him and his descendants the territory on which he has walked, because he has wholeheartedly followed me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">As for me, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was also angry with me on your account. He said, "You also will not be able to go there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">However, Joshua son of Nun, your assistant, will go. Encourage him, because he will enable Israel to inherit the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Also, your infants, who you thought would die on the way, and your children, who as yet do not know good from bad, will go there; I will give them the land and they will possess it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But as for you, turn back and head for the desert by the way to the Red Sea."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then you responded to me and admitted, "We have sinned against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. We will now go up and fight as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God has told us to do." So you each put on your battle gear and prepared to go up to the hill country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> told me: "Tell them this: 'Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you and you will be defeated by your enemies.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">I spoke to you, but you did not listen. Instead you rebelled against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and recklessly went up to the hill country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The Amorite inhabitants of that area confronted you and chased you like a swarm of bees, striking you down from Seir as far as Hormah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then you came back and wept before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, but he paid no attention to you whatsoever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Therefore, you remained at Kadesh for a long time - indeed, for the full time.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then we turned and set out toward the desert land on the way to the Red Sea just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> told me to do, detouring around Mount Seir for a long time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">At this point the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"You have circled around this mountain long enough; now turn north.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Instruct these people as follows: 'You are about to cross the border of your relatives the descendants of Esau, who inhabit Seir. They will be afraid of you, so watch yourselves carefully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Do not be hostile toward them, because I am not giving you any of their land, not even a footprint, for I have given Mount Seir as an inheritance for Esau.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You may purchase food to eat and water to drink from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All along the way I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God, have blessed your every effort. I have been attentive to your travels through this great wasteland. These forty years I have been with you; you have lacked for nothing.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So we turned away from our relatives the descendants of Esau, the inhabitants of Seir, turning from the desert route, from Elat and Ezion Geber, and traveling the way of the Moab wastelands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to me, "Do not harass Moab and provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land as your territory. This is because I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their possession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">(The Emites used to live there, a people as powerful, numerous, and tall as the Anakites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">These people, as well as the Anakites, are also considered Rephaites; the Moabites call them Emites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Previously the Horites lived in Seir but the descendants of Esau dispossessed and destroyed them and settled in their place, just as Israel did to the land it came to possess, the land the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> gave them.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now, get up and cross the Wadi Zered." So we did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the length of time it took for us to go from Kadesh Barnea to the crossing of Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years, time for all the military men of that generation to die, just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had vowed to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Indeed, it was the very hand of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> that eliminated them from within the camp until they were all gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So it was that after all the military men had been eliminated from the community,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">"Today you are going to cross the border of Moab, that is, of Ar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when you come close to the Ammonites, do not harass or provoke them because I am not giving you any of the Ammonites' land as your possession; I have already given it to Lot's descendants as their possession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">(That also is considered to be a land of the Rephaites. The Rephaites lived there originally; the Ammonites call them Zamzummites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They are a people as powerful, numerous, and tall as the Anakites. But the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> destroyed the Rephaites in advance of the Ammonites, so they dispossessed them and settled down in their place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">This is exactly what he did for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir when he destroyed the Horites before them so that they could dispossess them and settle in their area to this very day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As for the Avvites who lived in settlements as far west as Gaza, Caphtorites who came from Crete destroyed them and settled down in their place.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Get up, make your way across Wadi Arnon. Look! I have already delivered over to you Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Go ahead! Take it! Engage him in war!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This very day I will begin to fill all the people of the earth with dread and to terrify them when they hear about you. They will shiver and shake in anticipation of your approach."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then I sent messengers from the Kedemoth Desert to King Sihon of Heshbon with an offer of peace:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">Sell me food for cash so that I can eat and sell me water to drink. Just allow me to go through on foot,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">But King Sihon of Heshbon was unwilling to allow us to pass near him because the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God had made him obstinate and stubborn so that he might deliver him over to you this very day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to me, "Look! I have already begun to give over Sihon and his land to you. Start right now to take his land as your possession."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, along with his sons and everyone else.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">At that time we seized all his cities and put every one of them under divine judgment, including even the women and children; we left no survivors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">We kept only the livestock and plunder from the cities for ourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">From Aroer, which is at the edge of Wadi Arnon (it is the city in the wadi), all the way to Gilead there was not a town able to resist us - the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God gave them all to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">However, you did not approach the land of the Ammonites, the Wadi Jabbok, the cities of the hill country, or any place else forbidden by the LORD our God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">

      <VERS vnumber="3">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God did indeed give over to us King Og of Bashan and his whole army and we struck them down until not a single survivor was left.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">All of these cities were fortified by high walls, gates, and locking bars; in addition there were a great many open villages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We put all of these under divine judgment just as we had done to King Sihon of Heshbon - every occupied city, including women and children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But all the livestock and plunder from the cities we kept for ourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So at that time we took the land of the two Amorite kings in the Transjordan from Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion and the Amorites call it Senir),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">all the cities of the plateau, all of Gilead and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Only King Og of Bashan was left of the remaining Rephaites. (It is noteworthy that his sarcophagus was made of iron. Does it not, indeed, still remain in Rabbath of the Ammonites? It is thirteen and a half feet long and six feet wide according to standard measure.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">This is the land we brought under our control at that time: The territory extending from Aroer by the Wadi Arnon and half the Gilead hill country with its cities I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh. (All the region of Argob, that is, all Bashan, is called the land of Rephaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jair, son of Manasseh, took all the Argob region as far as the border with the Geshurites and Maacathites (namely Bashan) and called it by his name, Havvoth-Jair, which it retains to this very day.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I gave Gilead to Machir.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To the Reubenites and Gadites I allocated the territory extending from Gilead as far as Wadi Arnon (the exact middle of the wadi was a boundary) all the way to the Wadi Jabbok, the Ammonite border.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The Arabah and the Jordan River were also a border, from the sea of Chinnereth to the sea of the Arabah (that is, the Salt Sea), beneath the watershed of Pisgah to the east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">At that time I instructed you as follows: "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God has given you this land for your possession. You warriors are to cross over before your fellow Israelites equipped for battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But your wives, children, and livestock (of which I know you have many) may remain in the cities I have given you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You must fight until the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> gives your countrymen victory as he did you and they take possession of the land that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God is giving them on the other side of the Jordan River. Then each of you may return to his own territory that I have given you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I also commanded Joshua at the same time, "You have seen everything the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God did to these two kings; he will do the same to all the kingdoms where you are going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Do not be afraid of them, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God will personally fight for you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Moreover, at that time I pleaded with the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">"O, Lord God, you have begun to show me your greatness and strength. (What god in heaven or earth can rival your works and mighty deeds?)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let me please cross over to see the good land on the other side of the Jordan River - this good hill country and the Lebanon!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was angry at me because of you and would not listen to me. Instead, he said to me, "Enough of that! Do not speak to me anymore about this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Go up to the top of Pisgah and take a good look to the west, north, south, and east, for you will not be allowed to cross the Jordan.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Do not add a thing to what I command you nor subtract from it, so that you may keep the commandments of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God that I am delivering to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You have witnessed what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> did at Baal Peor, how he eradicated from your midst everyone who followed Baal Peor.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">So he humbled you by making you hungry and then feeding you with unfamiliar manna. He did this to teach you that humankind cannot live by bread alone, but also by everything that comes from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s mouth.</VERS>

It is because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is driving them out ahead of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It is not because of your righteousness, or even your inner uprightness, that you have come here to possess their land. Instead, because of the wickedness of these nations the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God is driving them out ahead of you in order to confirm the promise he made on oath to your ancestors, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Understand, therefore, that it is not because of your righteousness that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God is about to give you this good land as a possession, for you are a stubborn people!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Remember - don't ever forget - how you provoked the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God in the desert; from the time you left the land of Egypt until you came to this place you were constantly rebelling against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">At Horeb you provoked him and he was angry enough with you to destroy you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> made with you, I remained there forty days and nights, eating and drinking nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> gave me the two stone tablets, written by the very finger of God, and on them was everything he said to you at the mountain from the midst of the fire at the time of that assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now at the end of the forty days and nights the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> presented me with the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he said to me, "Get up, go down at once from here because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have sinned! They have quickly turned from the way I commanded them and have made for themselves a cast metal image."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Moreover, he said to me, "I have taken note of these people; they are a stubborn lot!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Stand aside and I will destroy them, obliterating their very name from memory, and I will make you into a stronger and more numerous nation than they are."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So I turned and went down the mountain while it was blazing with fire; the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When I looked, you had indeed sinned against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God and had cast for yourselves a metal calf; you had quickly turned aside from the way he had commanded you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I grabbed the two tablets, threw them down, and shattered them before your very eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then I again fell down before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> for forty days and nights; I ate and drank nothing because of all the sin you had committed, doing such evil before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> as to enrage him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I was terrified at the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s intense anger that threatened to destroy you. But he listened to me this time as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was also angry enough at Aaron to kill him, but at that time I prayed for him too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">As for your sinful thing that you had made, the calf, I took it, melted it down, ground it up until it was as fine as dust, and tossed the dust into the stream that flows down the mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Moreover, you continued to provoke the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> at Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth-Hattaavah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when he sent you from Kadesh-Barnea and told you, "Go up and possess the land I have given you," you rebelled against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God and would neither believe nor obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">You have been rebelling against him from the very first day I knew you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I lay flat on the ground before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> for forty days and nights, for he had said he would destroy you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I prayed to him: O, Lord God, do not destroy your people, your valued property that you have powerfully redeemed, whom you brought out of Egypt by your strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; ignore the stubbornness, wickedness, and sin of these people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Otherwise the people of the land from which you brought us will say, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was unable to bring them to the land he promised them, and because of his hatred for them he has brought them out to kill them in the desert."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They are your people, your valued property, whom you brought out with great strength and power.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that same time the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to me, "Carve out for yourself two stone tablets like the first ones and come up the mountain to me; also make for yourself a wooden ark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the first tablets you broke, and you must put them into the ark."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So I made an ark of acacia wood and carved out two stone tablets just like the first ones. Then I went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> then wrote on the tablets the same words, the ten commandments, which he had spoken to you at the mountain from the middle of the fire at the time of that assembly, and he gave them to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then I turned, went down the mountain, and placed the tablets into the ark I had made - they are still there, just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> commanded me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"During those days the Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene-Yaaqan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar became priest in his place.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">At that time the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s covenant, to stand before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> to serve him, and to formulate blessings in his name, as they do to this very day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore Levi has no allotment or inheritance among his brothers; the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is his inheritance just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God told him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As for me, I stayed at the mountain as I did the first time, forty days and nights. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> listened to me that time as well and decided not to destroy you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then he said to me, "Get up, set out leading the people so they may go and possess the land I promised to give to their ancestors."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now, Israel, what does the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God require of you except to revere him, to obey all his commandments, to love him, to serve him with all your mind and being,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When you go to war against your enemies and see chariotry and troops who outnumber you, do not be afraid of them, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, is with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">As you move forward for battle, the priest will approach and say to the soldiers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"Listen, Israel! Today you are moving forward to do battle with your enemies. Do not be fainthearted. Do not fear and tremble or be terrified because of them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God goes with you to fight on your behalf against your enemies to give you victory."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover, the officers are to say to the troops, "Who among you has built a new house and not dedicated it? He may go home, lest he die in battle and someone else dedicate it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Or who among you has planted a vineyard and not benefited from it? He may go home, lest he die in battle and someone else benefit from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Or who among you has become engaged to a woman but has not married her? He may go home, lest he die in battle and someone else marry her."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In addition, the officers are to say to the troops, "Who among you is afraid and fainthearted? He may go home so that he will not make his fellow soldier's heart as fearful as his own."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then, when the officers have finished speaking, they must appoint unit commanders to lead the troops.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When you approach a city to wage war against it, offer it terms of peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If it accepts your terms and submits to you, all the people found in it will become your slaves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If it does not accept terms of peace but makes war with you, then you are to lay siege to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God will deliver it over to you and you must kill every single male by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">However, the women, little children, cattle, and anything else in the city - all its plunder - you may take for yourselves as spoil. You may take from your enemies the plunder that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God has given you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">This is how you are to deal with all those cities located far from you, those that do not belong to these nearby nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As for the cities of these peoples that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God is going to give you as an inheritance, you must not allow a single living thing to survive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Instead you must utterly annihilate them - the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites - just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God has commanded you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">so that they cannot teach you all the abhorrent ways they worship their gods, causing you to sin against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If you besiege a city for a long time while attempting to capture it, you must not chop down its trees, for you may eat fruit from them and should not cut them down. A tree in the field is not human that you should besiege it!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">However, you may chop down any tree you know is not suitable for food, and you may use it to build siege works against the city that is making war with you until that city falls.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">If a homicide victim should be found lying in a field in the land the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God is giving you, and no one knows who killed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">your elders and judges must go out and measure how far it is to the cities in the vicinity of the corpse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the elders of the city nearest to the corpse must take from the herd a heifer that has not been worked - that has never pulled with the yoke -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and bring the heifer down to a wadi with flowing water, to a valley that is neither plowed nor sown. There at the wadi they are to break the heifer's neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the Levitical priests will approach (for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God has chosen them to serve him and to pronounce blessings in his name, and to decide every judicial verdict )</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and all the elders of that city nearest the corpse must wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then they must proclaim, "Our hands have not spilled this blood, nor have we witnessed the crime.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Do not blame your people Israel whom you redeemed, O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, and do not hold them accountable for the bloodshed of an innocent person." Then atonement will be made for the bloodshed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In this manner you will purge out the guilt of innocent blood from among you, for you must do what is right before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When you go out to do battle with your enemies and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God allows you to prevail and you take prisoners,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">if you should see among them an attractive woman whom you wish to take as a wife,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">you may bring her back to your house. She must shave her head, trim her nails,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">discard the clothing she was wearing when captured, and stay in your house, lamenting for her father and mother for a full month. After that you may have sexual relations with her and become her husband and she your wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If you are not pleased with her, then you must let her go where she pleases. You cannot in any case sell her; you must not take advantage of her, since you have already humiliated her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Suppose a man has two wives, one whom he loves more than the other, and they both bear him sons, with the firstborn being the child of the less loved wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In the day he divides his inheritance he must not appoint as firstborn the son of the favorite wife in place of the other wife's son who is actually the firstborn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Rather, he must acknowledge the son of the less loved wife as firstborn and give him the double portion of all he has, for that son is the beginning of his father's procreative power - to him should go the right of the firstborn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If a person has a stubborn, rebellious son who pays no attention to his father or mother, and they discipline him to no avail,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">his father and mother must seize him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">They must declare to the elders of his city, "Our son is stubborn and rebellious and pays no attention to what we say - he is a glutton and drunkard."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then all the men of his city must stone him to death. In this way you will purge out wickedness from among you, and all Israel will hear about it and be afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">If a person commits a sin punishable by death and is executed, and you hang the corpse on a tree,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">his body must not remain all night on the tree; instead you must make certain you bury him that same day, for the one who is left exposed on a tree is cursed by God. You must not defile your land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When you see your neighbor's ox or sheep going astray, do not ignore it; you must return it without fail to your neighbor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">If the owner does not live near you or you do not know who the owner is, then you must corral the animal at your house and let it stay with you until the owner looks for it; then you must return it to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You shall do the same to his donkey, his clothes, or anything else your neighbor has lost and you have found; you must not refuse to get involved.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor should a man dress up in women's clothing, for anyone who does this is offensive to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If you happen to notice a bird's nest along the road, whether in a tree or on the ground, and there are chicks or eggs with the mother bird sitting on them, you must not take the mother from the young.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Suppose a man marries a woman, has sexual relations with her, and then rejects her,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">accusing her of impropriety and defaming her reputation by saying, "I married this woman but when I had sexual relations with her I discovered she was not a virgin!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the father and mother of the young woman must produce the evidence of virginity for the elders of the city at the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The young woman's father must say to the elders, "I gave my daughter to this man and he has rejected her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover, he has raised accusations of impropriety by saying, 'I discovered your daughter was not a virgin,' but this is the evidence of my daughter's virginity!" The cloth must then be spread out before the city's elders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The elders of that city must then seize the man and punish him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They will fine him one hundred shekels of silver and give them to the young woman's father, for the man who made the accusation ruined the reputation of an Israelite virgin. She will then become his wife and he may never divorce her as long as he lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But if the accusation is true and the young woman was not a virgin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">the men of her city must bring the young woman to the door of her father's house and stone her to death, for she has done a disgraceful thing in Israel by behaving like a prostitute while living in her father's house. In this way you will purge evil from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">If a man is caught having sexual relations with a married woman both the man who had relations with the woman and the woman herself must die; in this way you will purge evil from Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If a virgin is engaged to a man and another man meets her in the city and has sexual relations with her,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">you must bring the two of them to the gate of that city and stone them to death, the young woman because she did not cry out though in the city and the man because he violated his neighbor's fiancée; in this way you will purge evil from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But if the man came across the engaged woman in the field and overpowered her and raped her, then only the rapist must die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">You must not do anything to the young woman - she has done nothing deserving of death. This case is the same as when someone attacks another person and murders him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">for the man met her in the field and the engaged woman cried out, but there was no one to rescue her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Suppose a man comes across a virgin who is not engaged and overpowers and rapes her and they are discovered.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s angelic messenger came and sat down under the oak tree in Ophrah owned by Joash the Abiezrite. He arrived while Joash's son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress so he could hide it from the Midianites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s messenger appeared and said to him, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is with you, courageous warrior!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Gideon said to him, "Pardon me, but if the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is with us, why has such disaster overtaken us? Where are all his miraculous deeds our ancestors told us about? They said, 'Did the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> not bring us up from Egypt?' But now the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has abandoned us and handed us over to Midian."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> himself turned to him and said, "You have the strength. Deliver Israel from the power of the Midianites! Have I not sent you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Gideon said to him, "But Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Just look! My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my family."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to him, "Ah, but I will be with you! You will strike down the whole Midianite army."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Gideon said to him, "If you really are pleased with me, then give me a sign as proof that it is really you speaking with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Do not leave this place until I come back with a gift and present it to you." The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "I will stay here until you come back."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Gideon went and prepared a young goat, along with unleavened bread made from an ephah of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot. He brought the food to him under the oak tree and presented it to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">God's messenger said to him, "Put the meat and unleavened bread on this rock, and pour out the broth." Gideon did as instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s messenger touched the meat and the unleavened bread with the tip of his staff. Fire flared up from the rock and consumed the meat and unleavened bread. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s messenger then disappeared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When Gideon realized that it was the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s messenger, he said, "Oh no! Master, <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>! I have seen the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s messenger face to face!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to him, "You are safe! Do not be afraid! You are not going to die!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Gideon built an altar for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> there, and named it "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is on friendly terms with me." To this day it is still there in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">That night the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to him, "Take the bull from your father's herd, as well as a second bull, one that is seven years old. Pull down your father's Baal altar and cut down the nearby Asherah pole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then build an altar for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God on the top of this stronghold according to the proper pattern. Take the second bull and offer it as a burnt sacrifice on the wood from the Asherah pole that you cut down."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So Gideon took ten of his servants and did just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had told him. He was too afraid of his father's family and the men of the city to do it in broad daylight, so he waited until nighttime.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When the men of the city got up the next morning, they saw the Baal altar pulled down, the nearby Asherah pole cut down, and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They said to one another, "Who did this?" They investigated the matter thoroughly and concluded that Gideon son of Joash had done it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The men of the city said to Joash, "Bring out your son, so we can execute him! He pulled down the Baal altar and cut down the nearby Asherah pole."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But Joash said to all those who confronted him, "Must you fight Baal's battles? Must you rescue him? Whoever takes up his cause will die by morning! If he really is a god, let him fight his own battles! After all, it was his altar that was pulled down."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">That very day Gideon's father named him Jerub-Baal, because he had said, "Let Baal fight with him, for it was his altar that was pulled down."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">All the Midianites, Amalekites, and the people from the east assembled. They crossed the Jordan River and camped in the Jezreel Valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s spirit took control of Gideon. He blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He sent messengers throughout Manasseh and summoned them to follow him as well. He also sent messengers throughout Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Gideon said to God, "If you really intend to use me to deliver Israel, as you promised, then give me a sign as proof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Look, I am putting a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece, and the ground around it is dry, then I will be sure that you will use me to deliver Israel, as you promised."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> did as he asked. When he got up the next morning, he squeezed the fleece, and enough dew dripped from it to fill a bowl.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Gideon said to God, "Please do not get angry at me, when I ask for just one more sign. Please allow me one more test with the fleece. This time make only the fleece dry, while the ground around it is covered with dew."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">That night God did as he asked. Only the fleece was dry and the ground around it was covered with dew.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) and his men got up the next morning and camped near the spring of Harod. The Midianites were camped north of them near the hill of Moreh in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Gideon, "You have too many men for me to hand Midian over to you. Israel might brag, 'Our own strength has delivered us.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now, announce to the men, 'Whoever is shaking with fear may turn around and leave Mount Gilead.'" Twenty-two thousand men went home; ten thousand remained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to Gideon again, "There are still too many men. Bring them down to the water and I will thin the ranks some more. When I say, 'This one should go with you,' pick him to go; when I say, 'This one should not go with you,' do not take him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he brought the men down to the water. Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Gideon, "Separate those who lap the water as a dog laps from those who kneel to drink."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Three hundred men lapped; the rest of the men kneeled to drink water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Gideon, "With the three hundred men who lapped I will deliver the whole army and I will hand Midian over to you. The rest of the men should go home."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The men who were chosen took supplies and their trumpets. Gideon sent all the men of Israel back to their homes; he kept only three hundred men. Now the Midianites were camped down below in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That night the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Gideon, "Get up! Attack the camp, for I am handing it over to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with Purah your servant</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and listen to what they are saying. Then you will be brave and attack the camp." So he went down with Purah his servant to where the sentries were guarding the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now the Midianites, Amalekites, and the people from the east covered the valley like a swarm of locusts. Their camels could not be counted; they were as innumerable as the sand on the seashore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Gideon arrived, he heard a man telling another man about a dream he had. The man said, "Look! I had a dream. I saw a stale cake of barley bread rolling into the Midianite camp. It hit a tent so hard it knocked it over and turned it upside down. The tent just collapsed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The other man said, "Without a doubt this symbolizes the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God is handing Midian and all the army over to him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When Gideon heard the report of the dream and its interpretation, he praised God. Then he went back to the Israelite camp and said, "Get up, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is handing the Midianite army over to you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He divided the three hundred men into three units. He gave them all trumpets and empty jars with torches inside them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He said to them, "Watch me and do as I do. Watch closely! I am going to the edge of the camp. Do as I do!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, you also blow your trumpets all around the camp. Then say, 'For the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and for Gideon!'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Gideon took a hundred men to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guards. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars they were carrying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">All three units blew their trumpets and broke their jars. They held the torches in their left hand and the trumpets in their right. Then they yelled, "A sword for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and for Gideon!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They stood in order all around the camp. The whole army ran away; they shouted as they scrambled away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When the three hundred men blew their trumpets, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> caused the Midianites to attack one another with their swords throughout the camp. The army fled to Beth Shittah on the way to Zererah. They went to the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Israelites from Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh answered the call and chased the Midianites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now Gideon sent messengers throughout the Ephraimite hill country who announced, "Go down and head off the Midianites. Take control of the fords of the streams all the way to Beth Barah and the Jordan River." When all the Ephraimites had assembled, they took control of the fords all the way to Beth Barah and the Jordan River.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They captured the two Midianite generals, Oreb and Zeeb. They executed Oreb on the rock of Oreb and Zeeb in the winepress of Zeeb. They chased the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was now on the other side of the Jordan River.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Ephraimites said to him, "Why have you done such a thing to us? You did not summon us when you went to fight the Midianites!" They argued vehemently with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said to them, "Now what have I accomplished compared to you? Even Ephraim's leftover grapes are better quality than Abiezer's harvest!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">It was to you that God handed over the Midianite generals, Oreb and Zeeb! What did I accomplish to rival that?" When he said this, they calmed down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now Gideon and his three hundred men had crossed over the Jordan River, and even though they were exhausted, they were still chasing the Midianites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He said to the men of Succoth, "Give some loaves of bread to the men who are following me, because they are exhausted. I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The officials of Succoth said, "You have not yet overpowered Zebah and Zalmunna. So why should we give bread to your army?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Gideon said, "Since you will not help, after the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> hands Zebah and Zalmunna over to me, I will thresh your skin with desert thorns and briers."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He went up from there to Penuel and made the same request. The men of Penuel responded the same way the men of Succoth had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He also threatened the men of Penuel, warning, "When I return victoriously, I will tear down this tower."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their armies. There were about fifteen thousand survivors from the army of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand sword-wielding soldiers had been killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Gideon went up the road of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and ambushed the surprised army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When Zebah and Zalmunna ran away, Gideon chased them and captured the two Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna. He had surprised their entire army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the pass of Heres.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He captured a young man from Succoth and interrogated him. The young man wrote down for him the names of Succoth's officials and city leaders - seventy-seven men in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He approached the men of Succoth and said, "Look what I have! Zebah and Zalmunna! You insulted me, saying, 'You have not yet overpowered Zebah and Zalmunna. So why should we give bread to your exhausted men?'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He seized the leaders of the city, along with some desert thorns and briers; he then "threshed" the men of Succoth with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He also tore down the tower of Penuel and executed the city's men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "Describe for me the men you killed at Tabor." They said, "They were like you. Each one looked like a king's son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. I swear, as surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is alive, if you had let them live, I would not kill you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He ordered Jether his firstborn son, "Come on! Kill them!" But Jether was too afraid to draw his sword, because he was still young.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, "Come on, you strike us, for a man is judged by his strength." So Gideon killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent-shaped ornaments which were on the necks of their camels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us - you, your son, and your grandson. For you have delivered us from Midian's power."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will rule over you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Gideon continued, "I would like to make one request. Each of you give me an earring from the plunder you have taken." (The Midianites had gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They said, "We are happy to give you earrings." So they spread out a garment, and each one threw an earring from his plunder onto it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The total weight of the gold earrings he requested came to seventeen hundred gold shekels. This was in addition to the crescent-shaped ornaments, jewelry, purple clothing worn by the Midianite kings, and the necklaces on the camels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Gideon used all this to make an ephod, which he put in his hometown of Ophrah. All the Israelites prostituted themselves to it by worshiping it there. It became a snare to Gideon and his family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The Israelites humiliated Midian; the Midianites' fighting spirit was broken. The land had rest for forty years during Gideon's time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Jerub-Baal son of Joash went home and settled down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Gideon fathered seventy sons through his many wives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also gave him a son, whom he named Abimelech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Gideon son of Joash died at a very old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash located in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">After Gideon died, the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They made Baal-Berith their god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The Israelites did not remain true to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> their God, who had delivered them from all the enemies who lived around them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">They did not treat the family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) fairly in return for all the good he had done for Israel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Abimelech son of Jerub-Baal went to Shechem to see his mother's relatives. He said to them and to his mother's entire extended family,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Tell all the leaders of Shechem this: 'Why would you want to have seventy men, all Jerub-Baal's sons, ruling over you, when you can have just one ruler? Recall that I am your own flesh and blood.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His mother's relatives spoke on his behalf to all the leaders of Shechem and reported his proposal. The leaders were drawn to Abimelech; they said, "He is our close relative."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They paid him seventy silver shekels out of the temple of Baal-Berith. Abimelech then used the silver to hire some lawless, dangerous men as his followers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He went to his father's home in Ophrah and murdered his half-brothers, the seventy legitimate sons of Jerub-Baal, on one stone. Only Jotham, Jerub-Baal's youngest son, escaped, because he hid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">All the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo assembled and then went and made Abimelech king by the oak near the pillar in Shechem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When Jotham heard the news, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim. He spoke loudly to the people below, "Listen to me, leaders of Shechem, so that God may listen to you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"The trees were determined to go out and choose a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, 'Be our king!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But the olive tree said to them, 'I am not going to stop producing my oil, which is used to honor gods and men, just to sway above the other trees!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"So the trees said to the fig tree, 'You come and be our king!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the fig tree said to them, 'I am not going to stop producing my sweet figs, my excellent fruit, just to sway above the other trees!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"So the trees said to the grapevine, 'You come and be our king!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the grapevine said to them, 'I am not going to stop producing my wine, which makes gods and men so happy, just to sway above the other trees!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"So all the trees said to the thornbush, 'You come and be our king!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The thornbush said to the trees, 'If you really want to choose me as your king, then come along, find safety under my branches! Otherwise may fire blaze from the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"Now, if you have shown loyalty and integrity when you made Abimelech king, if you have done right to Jerub-Baal and his family, if you have properly repaid him -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">my father fought for you; he risked his life and delivered you from Midian's power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But you have attacked my father's family today. You murdered his seventy legitimate sons on one stone and made Abimelech, the son of his female slave, king over the leaders of Shechem, just because he is your close relative.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So if you have shown loyalty and integrity to Jerub-Baal and his family today, then may Abimelech bring you happiness and may you bring him happiness!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But if not, may fire blaze from Abimelech and consume the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo! May fire also blaze from the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo and consume Abimelech!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Jotham ran away to Beer and lived there to escape from Abimelech his half-brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Abimelech commanded Israel for three years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">God sent a spirit to stir up hostility between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem. He made the leaders of Shechem disloyal to Abimelech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He did this so the violent deaths of Jerub-Baal's seventy sons might be avenged and Abimelech, their half-brother who murdered them, might have to pay for their spilled blood, along with the leaders of Shechem who helped him murder them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The leaders of Shechem rebelled against Abimelech by putting bandits in the hills, who robbed everyone who traveled by on the road. But Abimelech found out about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Gaal son of Ebed came through Shechem with his brothers. The leaders of Shechem transferred their loyalty to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They went out to the field, harvested their grapes, squeezed out the juice, and celebrated. They came to the temple of their god and ate, drank, and cursed Abimelech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Gaal son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerub-Baal, and is not Zebul the deputy he appointed? Serve the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem! But why should we serve Abimelech?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">If only these men were under my command, I would get rid of Abimelech!" He challenged Abimelech, "Muster your army and come out for battle!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When Zebul, the city commissioner, heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he was furious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He sent messengers to Abimelech, who was in Arumah, reporting, "Beware! Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers are coming to Shechem and inciting the city to rebel against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now, come up at night with your men and set an ambush in the field outside the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">In the morning at sunrise quickly attack the city. When he and his men come out to fight you, do what you can to him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">So Abimelech and all his men came up at night and set an ambush outside Shechem - they divided into four units.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When Gaal son of Ebed came out and stood at the entrance to the city's gate, Abimelech and his men got up from their hiding places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Gaal saw the men and said to Zebul, "Look, men are coming down from the tops of the hills." But Zebul said to him, "You are seeing the shadows on the hills - it just looks like men."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Gaal again said, "Look, men are coming down from the very center of the land. A unit is coming by way of the Oak Tree of the Diviners."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Zebul said to him, "Where now are your bragging words, 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Are these not the men you insulted? Go out now and fight them!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">So Gaal led the leaders of Shechem out and fought Abimelech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Abimelech chased him, and Gaal ran from him. Many Shechemites fell wounded at the entrance of the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Abimelech went back to Arumah; Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The next day the Shechemites came out to the field. When Abimelech heard about it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">he took his men and divided them into three units and set an ambush in the field. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he attacked and struck them down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Abimelech and his units attacked and blocked the entrance to the city's gate. Two units then attacked all the people in the field and struck them down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He captured the city and killed all the people in it. Then he leveled the city and spread salt over it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard the news, they went to the stronghold of the temple of El-Berith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Abimelech heard that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were in one place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He and all his men went up on Mount Zalmon. He took an ax in his hand and cut off a tree branch. He put it on his shoulder and said to his men, "Quickly, do what you have just seen me do!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">So each of his men also cut off a branch and followed Abimelech. They put the branches against the stronghold and set fire to it. All the people of the Tower of Shechem died - about a thousand men and women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Abimelech moved on to Thebez; he besieged and captured it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">There was a fortified tower in the center of the city, so all the men and women, as well as the city's leaders, ran into it and locked the entrance. Then they went up to the roof of the tower.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">The rulers of the Philistines went up to visit her and said to her, "Trick him! Find out what makes him so strong and how we can subdue him and humiliate him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred silver pieces."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Delilah said to Samson, "Tell me what makes you so strong and how you can be subdued and humiliated."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Samson said to her, "If they tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I will become weak and be just like any other man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings which had not been dried and they tied him up with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They hid in the bedroom and then she said to him, "The Philistines are here, Samson!" He snapped the bowstrings as easily as a thread of yarn snaps when it is put close to fire. The secret of his strength was not discovered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Delilah said to Samson, "Look, you deceived me and told me lies! Now tell me how you can be subdued."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He said to her, "If they tie me tightly with brand new ropes that have never been used, I will become weak and be just like any other man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them and said to him, "The Philistines are here, Samson!" (The Philistines were hiding in the bedroom.) But he tore the ropes from his arms as if they were a piece of thread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Delilah said to Samson, "Up to now you have deceived me and told me lies. Tell me how you can be subdued." He said to her, "If you weave the seven braids of my hair into the fabric on the loom and secure it with the pin, I will become weak and be like any other man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So she made him go to sleep, wove the seven braids of his hair into the fabric on the loom, fastened it with the pin, and said to him, "The Philistines are here, Samson!" He woke up and tore away the pin of the loom and the fabric.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">She said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when you will not share your secret with me? Three times you have deceived me and have not told me what makes you so strong."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">She nagged him every day and pressured him until he was sick to death of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Finally he told her his secret. He said to her, "My hair has never been cut, for I have been dedicated to God from the time I was conceived. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me; I would become weak, and be just like all other men."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When Delilah saw that he had told her his secret, she sent for the rulers of the Philistines, saying, "Come up here again, for he has told me his secret." So the rulers of the Philistines went up to visit her, bringing the silver in their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">She made him go to sleep on her lap and then called a man in to shave off the seven braids of his hair. She made him vulnerable and his strength left him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">She said, "The Philistines are here, Samson!" He woke up and thought, "I will do as I did before and shake myself free." But he did not realize that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had left him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The Philistines captured him and gouged out his eyes. They brought him down to Gaza and bound him in bronze chains. He became a grinder in the prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">His hair began to grow back after it had been shaved off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The rulers of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate. They said, "Our god has handed Samson, our enemy, over to us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, "Our god has handed our enemy over to us, the one who ruined our land and killed so many of us!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they really started celebrating, they said, "Call for Samson so he can entertain us!" So they summoned Samson from the prison and he entertained them. They made him stand between two pillars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Samson said to the young man who held his hand, "Position me so I can touch the pillars that support the temple. Then I can lean on them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now the temple was filled with men and women, and all the rulers of the Philistines were there. There were three thousand men and women on the roof watching Samson entertain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Samson called to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "O Master, <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, remember me! Strengthen me just one more time, O God, so I can get swift revenge against the Philistines for my two eyes!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Samson took hold of the two middle pillars that supported the temple and he leaned against them, with his right hand on one and his left hand on the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" He pushed hard and the temple collapsed on the rulers and all the people in it. He killed many more people in his death than he had killed during his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">His brothers and all his family went down and brought him back. They buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led Israel for twenty years.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a man named Micah from the Ephraimite hill country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said to his mother, "You know the eleven hundred pieces of silver which were stolen from you, about which I heard you pronounce a curse? Look here, I have the silver. I stole it, but now I am giving it back to you." His mother said, "May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> reward you, my son!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When he gave back to his mother the eleven hundred pieces of silver, his mother said, "I solemnly dedicate this silver to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. It will be for my son's benefit. We will use it to make a carved image and a metal image."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When he gave the silver back to his mother, she took two hundred pieces of silver to a silversmith, who made them into a carved image and a metal image. She then put them in Micah's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now this man Micah owned a shrine. He made an ephod and some personal idols and hired one of his sons to serve as a priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In those days Israel had no king. Each man did what he considered to be right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah. He was a Levite who had been temporarily residing among the tribe of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah to find another place to live. He came to the Ephraimite hill country and made his way to Micah's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Micah said to him, "Where do you come from?" He replied, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah. I am looking for a new place to live."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Micah said to him, "Stay with me. Become my adviser and priest. I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, plus clothes and food."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So the Levite agreed to stay with the man; the young man was like a son to Micah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Micah paid the Levite; the young man became his priest and lived in Micah's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Micah said, "Now I know God will make me rich, because I have this Levite as my priest."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days Israel had no king. And in those days the Danite tribe was looking for a place to settle, because at that time they did not yet have a place to call their own among the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Danites sent out from their whole tribe five representatives, capable men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and explore it. They said to them, "Go, explore the land." They came to the Ephraimite hill country and spent the night at Micah's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">As they approached Micah's house, they recognized the accent of the young Levite. So they stopped there and said to him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He told them what Micah had done for him, saying, "He hired me and I became his priest."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They said to him, "Seek a divine oracle for us, so we can know if we will be successful on our mission."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The priest said to them, "Go with confidence. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will be with you on your mission."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So the five men journeyed on and arrived in Laish. They noticed that the people there were living securely, like the Sidonians do, undisturbed and unsuspecting. No conqueror was troubling them in any way. They lived far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When the Danites returned to their tribe in Zorah and Eshtaol, their kinsmen asked them, "How did it go?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They said, "Come on, let's attack them, for we saw their land and it is very good. You seem lethargic, but don't hesitate to invade and conquer the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When you invade, you will encounter unsuspecting people. The land is wide! God is handing it over to you - a place that lacks nothing on earth!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So six hundred Danites, fully armed, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They went up and camped in Kiriath Jearim in Judah. (To this day that place is called Camp of Dan. It is west of Kiriath Jearim.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From there they traveled through the Ephraimite hill country and arrived at Micah's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laish said to their kinsmen, "Do you realize that inside these houses are an ephod, some personal idols, a carved image, and a metal image? Decide now what you want to do."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They stopped there, went inside the young Levite's house (which belonged to Micah), and asked him how he was doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Meanwhile the six hundred Danites, fully armed, stood at the entrance to the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The five men who had gone to spy out the land broke in and stole the carved image, the ephod, the personal idols, and the metal image, while the priest was standing at the entrance to the gate with the six hundred fully armed men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When these men broke into Micah's house and stole the carved image, the ephod, the personal idols, and the metal image, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They said to him, "Shut up! Put your hand over your mouth and come with us! You can be our adviser and priest. Wouldn't it be better to be a priest for a whole Israelite tribe than for just one man's family?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The priest was happy. He took the ephod, the personal idols, and the carved image and joined the group.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They turned and went on their way, but they walked behind the children, the cattle, and their possessions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After they had gone a good distance from Micah's house, Micah's neighbors gathered together and caught up with the Danites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When they called out to the Danites, the Danites turned around and said to Micah, "Why have you gathered together?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He said, "You stole my gods that I made, as well as this priest, and then went away. What do I have left? How can you have the audacity to say to me, 'What do you want?'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The Danites said to him, "Don't say another word to us, or some very angry men will attack you, and you and your family will die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The Danites went on their way; when Micah realized they were too strong to resist, he turned around and went home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now the Danites took what Micah had made, as well as his priest, and came to Laish, where the people were undisturbed and unsuspecting. They struck them down with the sword and burned the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">No one came to the rescue because the city was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and occupied it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They named it Dan after their ancestor, who was one of Israel's sons. But the city's name used to be Laish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The Danites worshiped the carved image. Jonathan, descendant of Gershom, son of Moses, and his descendants served as priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the exile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They worshiped Micah's carved image the whole time God's authorized shrine was in Shiloh.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days Israel had no king. There was a Levite living temporarily in the remote region of the Ephraimite hill country. He acquired a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">However, she got angry at him and went home to her father's house in Bethlehem in Judah. When she had been there four months,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">her husband came after her, hoping he could convince her to return. He brought with him his servant and a pair of donkeys. When she brought him into her father's house and the girl's father saw him, he greeted him warmly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">His father-in-law, the girl's father, persuaded him to stay with him for three days, and they ate and drank together, and spent the night there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">On the fourth day they woke up early and the Levite got ready to leave. But the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Have a bite to eat for some energy, then you can go."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the two of them sat down and had a meal together. Then the girl's father said to the man, "Why not stay another night and have a good time!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When the man got ready to leave, his father-in-law convinced him to stay another night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He woke up early in the morning on the fifth day so he could leave, but the girl's father said, "Get some energy. Wait until later in the day to leave!" So they ate a meal together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When the man got ready to leave with his concubine and his servant, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, "Look! The day is almost over! Stay another night! Since the day is over, stay another night here and have a good time. You can get up early tomorrow and start your trip home."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the man did not want to stay another night. He left and traveled as far as Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a pair of saddled donkeys and his concubine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When they got near Jebus, it was getting quite late and the servant said to his master, "Come on, let's stop at this Jebusite city and spend the night in it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But his master said to him, "We should not stop at a foreign city where non-Israelites live. We will travel on to Gibeah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He said to his servant, "Come on, we will go into one of the other towns and spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So they traveled on, and the sun went down when they were near Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They stopped there and decided to spend the night in Gibeah. They came into the city and sat down in the town square, but no one invited them to spend the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But then an old man passed by, returning at the end of the day from his work in the field. The man was from the Ephraimite hill country; he was living temporarily in Gibeah. (The residents of the town were Benjaminites.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When he looked up and saw the traveler in the town square, the old man said, "Where are you heading? Where do you come from?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Levite said to him, "We are traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote region of the Ephraimite hill country. That's where I'm from. I had business in Bethlehem in Judah, but now I'm heading home. But no one has invited me into their home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">We have enough straw and grain for our donkeys, and there is enough food and wine for me, your female servant, and the young man who is with your servants. We lack nothing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The old man said, "Everything is just fine! I will take care of all your needs. But don't spend the night in the town square."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So he brought him to his house and fed the donkeys. They washed their feet and had a meal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They were having a good time, when suddenly some men of the city, some good-for-nothings, surrounded the house and kept beating on the door. They said to the old man who owned the house, "Send out the man who came to visit you so we can have sex with him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The man who owned the house went outside and said to them, "No, my brothers! Don't do this wicked thing! After all, this man is a guest in my house. Don't do such a disgraceful thing!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Here are my virgin daughter and my guest's concubine. I will send them out and you can abuse them and do to them whatever you like. But don't do such a disgraceful thing to this man!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The men refused to listen to him, so the Levite grabbed his concubine and made her go outside. They raped her and abused her all night long until morning. They let her go at dawn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The woman arrived back at daybreak and was sprawled out on the doorstep of the house where her master was staying until it became light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When her master got up in the morning, opened the doors of the house, and went outside to start on his journey, there was the woman, his concubine, sprawled out on the doorstep of the house with her hands on the threshold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He said to her, "Get up, let's leave!" But there was no response. He put her on the donkey and went home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When he got home, he took a knife, grabbed his concubine, and carved her up into twelve pieces. Then he sent the pieces throughout Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Everyone who saw the sight said, "Nothing like this has happened or been witnessed during the entire time since the Israelites left the land of Egypt! Take careful note of it! Discuss it and speak!"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">The Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah. Then the Israelites said, "Explain how this wicked thing happened!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, spoke up, "I and my concubine stopped in Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin to spend the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The leaders of Gibeah attacked me and at night surrounded the house where I was staying. They wanted to kill me; instead they abused my concubine so badly that she died.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">All you Israelites, make a decision here!"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">They said, "Why, O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel, has this happened in Israel?" An entire tribe has disappeared from Israel today!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The next morning the people got up early and built an altar there. They offered up burnt sacrifices and token of peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The Israelites asked, "Who from all the Israelite tribes has not assembled before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>?" They had made a solemn oath that whoever did not assemble before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> at Mizpah must certainly be executed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The Israelites regretted what had happened to their brother Benjamin. They said, "Today we cut off an entire tribe from Israel!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">How can we find wives for those who are left? After all, we took an oath in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s name not to give them our daughters as wives."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So they asked, "Who from all the Israelite tribes did not assemble before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> at Mizpah?" Now it just so happened no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the gathering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they took roll call, they noticed none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead were there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the assembly sent 12,000 capable warriors against Jabesh Gilead. They commanded them, "Go and kill with your swords the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead, including the women and little children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Do this: exterminate every male, as well as every woman who has had sexual relations with a male. But spare the lives of any virgins." So they did as instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young girls who were virgins - they had never had sexual relations with a male. They brought them back to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The entire assembly sent messengers to the Benjaminites at the cliff of Rimmon and assured them they would not be harmed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The Benjaminites returned at that time, and the Israelites gave to them the women they had spared from Jabesh Gilead. But there were not enough to go around.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The people regretted what had happened to Benjamin because the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had weakened the Israelite tribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The leaders of the assembly said, "How can we find wives for those who are left? After all, the Benjaminite women have been wiped out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The remnant of Benjamin must be preserved. An entire Israelite tribe should not be wiped out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But we can't allow our daughters to marry them, for the Israelites took an oath, saying, 'Whoever gives a woman to a Benjaminite will be destroyed!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">However, there is an annual festival to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel (east of the main road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem) and south of Lebonah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So they commanded the Benjaminites, "Go hide in the vineyards,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and keep your eyes open. When you see the daughters of Shiloh coming out to dance in the celebration, jump out from the vineyards. Each one of you, catch yourself a wife from among the daughters of Shiloh and then go home to the land of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When their fathers or brothers come and protest to us, we'll say to them, "Do us a favor and let them be, for we could not get each one a wife through battle. Don't worry about breaking your oath! You would only be guilty if you had voluntarily given them wives.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The Benjaminites did as instructed. They abducted two hundred of the dancing girls to be their wives. They went home to their own territory, rebuilt their cities, and settled down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then the Israelites dispersed from there to their respective tribal and clan territories. Each went from there to his own property.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">In those days Israel had no king. Each man did what he considered to be right.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="8" bname="Ruth" bsname="Rth">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">During the time of the judges there was a famine in the land of Judah. So a man from Bethlehem in Judah went to live as a resident foreigner in the region of Moab, along with his wife and two sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(Now the man's name was Elimelech, his wife was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were of the clan of Ephrath from Bethlehem in Judah.) They entered the region of Moab and settled there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Sometime later Naomi's husband Elimelech died, so she and her two sons were left alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So her sons married Moabite women. (One was named Orpah and the other Ruth.) And they continued to live there about ten years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Naomi's two sons, Mahlon and Kilion, also died. So the woman was left all alone - bereaved of her two children as well as her husband!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So she decided to return home from the region of Moab, accompanied by her daughters-in-law, because while she was living in Moab she had heard that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had shown concern for his people, reversing the famine by providing abundant crops.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now as she and her two daughters-in-law began to leave the place where she had been living to return to the land of Judah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Listen to me! Each of you should return to your mother's home! May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> show you the same kind of devotion that you have shown to your deceased husbands and to me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> enable each of you to find security in the home of a new husband!" Then she kissed them goodbye and they wept loudly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But they said to her, "No! We will return with you to your people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Naomi replied, "Go back home, my daughters! There is no reason for you to return to Judah with me! I am no longer capable of giving birth to sons who might become your husbands!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Go back home, my daughters! For I am too old to get married again. Even if I thought that there was hope that I could get married tonight and conceive sons,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">surely you would not want to wait until they were old enough to marry! Surely you would not remain unmarried all that time! No, my daughters, you must not return with me. For my intense suffering is too much for you to bear. For the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is afflicting me!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Again they wept loudly. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung tightly to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So Naomi said, "Look, your sister-in-law is returning to her people and to her god. Follow your sister-in-law back home!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Ruth replied,"Stop urging me to abandon you! For wherever you go, I will go. Wherever you live, I will live. Your people will become my people, and your God will become my God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Wherever you die, I will die - and there I will be buried. May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> punish me severely if I do not keep my promise! Only death will be able to separate me from you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped trying to dissuade her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So the two of them journeyed together until they arrived in Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole village was excited about their arrival. The women of the village said, "Can this be Naomi?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But she replied to them, "Don't call me 'Naomi'! Call me 'Mara' because the Sovereign One has treated me very harshly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I left here full, but the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has caused me to return empty-handed. Why do you call me 'Naomi,' seeing that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has opposed me, and the Sovereign One has caused me to suffer?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Naomi returned, accompanied by her Moabite daughter-in-law Ruth, who came back with her from the region of Moab. (Now they arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.)</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side of the family named Boaz. He was a wealthy, prominent man from the clan of Elimelech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">One day Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, "Let me go to the fields so I can gather grain behind whoever permits me to do so." Naomi replied, "You may go, my daughter."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Ruth went and gathered grain in the fields behind the harvesters. Now she just happened to end up in the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now at that very moment, Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, "May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> be with you!" They replied, "May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> bless you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Boaz asked his servant in charge of the harvesters, "To whom does this young woman belong?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The servant in charge of the harvesters replied, "She's the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the region of Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">She asked, 'May I follow the harvesters and gather grain among the bundles?' Since she arrived she has been working hard from this morning until now - except for sitting in the resting hut a short time."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Boaz said to Ruth, "Listen carefully, my dear! Do not leave to gather grain in another field. You need not go beyond the limits of this field. You may go along beside my female workers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Take note of the field where the men are harvesting and follow behind with the female workers. I will tell the men to leave you alone. When you are thirsty, you may go to the water jars and drink some of the water the servants draw."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Ruth knelt before him with her forehead to the ground and said to him, "Why are you so kind and so attentive to me, even though I am a foreigner?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Boaz replied to her, "I have been given a full report of all that you have done for your mother-in-law following the death of your husband - how you left your father and your mother, as well as your homeland, and came to live among people you did not know previously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> reward your efforts! May your acts of kindness be repaid fully by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel, from whom you have sought protection!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">She said, "You really are being kind to me, sir, for you have reassured and encouraged me, your servant, even though I am not one of your servants!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Later during the mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come here and have some food! Dip your bread in the vinegar!" So she sat down beside the harvesters. Then he handed her some roasted grain. She ate until she was full and saved the rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When she got up to gather grain, Boaz told his male servants, "Let her gather grain even among the bundles! Don't chase her off!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Make sure you pull out ears of grain for her and drop them so she can gather them up. Don't tell her not to!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So she gathered grain in the field until evening. When she threshed what she had gathered, it came to about thirty pounds of barley!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much grain she had gathered. Then Ruth gave her the roasted grain she had saved from mealtime.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Her mother-in-law asked her, "Where did you gather grain today? Where did you work? May the one who took notice of you be rewarded!" So Ruth told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked. She said, "The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "May he be rewarded by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> because he has shown loyalty to the living on behalf of the dead!" Then Naomi said to her, "This man is a close relative of ours; he is our guardian."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Ruth the Moabite replied, "He even told me, 'You may go along beside my servants until they have finished gathering all my harvest!'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Naomi then said to her daughter-in-law Ruth, "It is good, my daughter, that you should go out to work with his female servants. That way you will not be harmed, which could happen in another field."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So Ruth worked beside Boaz's female servants, gathering grain until the end of the barley harvest as well as the wheat harvest. After that she stayed home with her mother-in-law.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time, Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, "My daughter, I must find a home for you so you will be secure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now Boaz, with whose female servants you worked, is our close relative. Look, tonight he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So bathe yourself, rub on some perfumed oil, and get dressed up. Then go down to the threshing floor. But don't let the man know you're there until he finishes his meal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When he gets ready to go to sleep, take careful notice of the place where he lies down. Then go, uncover his legs, and lie down beside him. He will tell you what you should do."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Ruth replied to Naomi, "I will do everything you have told me to do."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When Boaz had finished his meal and was feeling satisfied, he lay down to sleep at the far end of the grain heap. Then Ruth crept up quietly, uncovered his legs, and lay down beside him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In the middle of the night he was startled and turned over. Now he saw a woman lying beside him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said, "Who are you?" She replied, "I am Ruth, your servant. Marry your servant, for you are a guardian of the family interests."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said, "May you be rewarded by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, my dear! This act of devotion is greater than what you did before. For you have not sought to marry one of the young men, whether rich or poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now, my dear, don't worry! I intend to do for you everything you propose, for everyone in the village knows that you are a worthy woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now yes, it is true that I am a guardian, but there is another guardian who is a closer relative than I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Remain here tonight. Then in the morning, if he agrees to marry you, fine, let him do so. But if he does not want to do so, I promise, as surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives, to marry you. Sleep here until morning."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So she slept beside him until morning. She woke up while it was still dark. Boaz thought, "No one must know that a woman visited the threshing floor."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then he said, "Hold out the shawl you are wearing and grip it tightly." As she held it tightly, he measured out about sixty pounds of barley into the shawl and put it on her shoulders. Then he went into town,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and she returned to her mother-in-law.When Ruth returned to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, "How did things turn out for you, my daughter?" Ruth told her about all the man had done for her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">She said, "He gave me these sixty pounds of barley, for he said to me, 'Do not go to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Naomi said, "Stay put, my daughter, until you know how the matter turns out. For the man will not rest until he has taken care of the matter today."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Boaz went up to the village gate and sat there. Then along came the guardian whom Boaz had mentioned to Ruth! Boaz said, "Come here and sit down, 'John Doe'!" So he came and sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Boaz chose ten of the village leaders and said, "Sit down here!" So they sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Boaz said to the guardian, "Naomi, who has returned from the region of Moab, is selling the portion of land that belongs to our relative Elimelech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So I am legally informing you: Acquire it before those sitting here and before the leaders of my people! If you want to exercise your right to redeem it, then do so. But if not, then tell me so I will know. For you possess the first option to redeem it; I am next in line after you." He replied, "I will redeem it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Boaz said, "When you acquire the field from Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the wife of our deceased relative, in order to preserve his family name by raising up a descendant who will inherit his property."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The guardian said, "Then I am unable to redeem it, for I would ruin my own inheritance in that case. You may exercise my redemption option, for I am unable to redeem it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">(Now this used to be the customary way to finalize a transaction involving redemption in Israel: A man would remove his sandal and give it to the other party. This was a legally binding act in Israel.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the guardian said to Boaz, "You may acquire it," and he removed his sandal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Boaz said to the leaders and all the people, "You are witnesses today that I have acquired from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech, Kilion, and Mahlon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, as my wife to raise up a descendant who will inherit his property so the name of the deceased might not disappear from among his relatives and from his village. You are witnesses today."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All the people who were at the gate and the elders replied, "We are witnesses. May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> make the woman who is entering your home like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built up the house of Israel! May you prosper in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">May your family become like the family of Perez - whom Tamar bore to Judah - through the descendants the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> gives you by this young woman."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Boaz married Ruth and had sexual relations with her. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> enabled her to conceive and she gave birth to a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The village women said to Naomi, "May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> be praised because he has not left you without a guardian today! May he become famous in Israel!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He will encourage you and provide for you when you are old, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, has given him birth. She is better to you than seven sons!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Naomi took the child and placed him on her lap; she became his caregiver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The neighbor women named him, saying, "A son has been born to Naomi." They named him Obed. Now he became the father of Jesse - David's father!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">These are the descendants of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Hezron was the father of Ram, Ram was the father of Amminadab,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Amminadab was the father of Nachshon, Nachshon was the father of Salmah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Salmon was the father of Boaz, Boaz was the father of Obed,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a man from Ramathaim Zophim, from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah. He was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He had two wives; the name of the first was Hannah and the name of the second was Peninnah. Now Peninnah had children, but Hannah was childless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Year after year this man would go up from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> of hosts at Shiloh. It was there that the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, served as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he used to give meat portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But he would give a double portion to Hannah, because he especially loved her. Now the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had not enabled her to have children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Her rival wife used to upset her and make her worry, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had not enabled her to have children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Peninnah would behave this way year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s house, Peninnah would upset her so that she would weep and refuse to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Finally her husband Elkanah said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep and not eat? Why are you so sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">On one occasion in Shiloh, after they had finished eating and drinking, Hannah got up. (Now at the time Eli the priest was sitting in his chair by the doorpost of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">She was very upset as she prayed to the Lord, and she was weeping uncontrollably.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">She made a vow saying, "O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> of hosts, if you will look with compassion on the suffering of your female servant, remembering me and not forgetting your servant, and give a male child to your servant, then I will dedicate him to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> all the days of his life. His hair will never be cut."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As she continued praying to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, Eli was watching her mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now Hannah was speaking from her heart. Although her lips were moving, her voice was inaudible. Eli therefore thought she was drunk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So he said to her, "How often do you intend to get drunk? Put away your wine!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Hannah replied, "That's not the way it is, my lord! I am under a great deal of stress. I have drunk neither wine nor beer. Rather, I have poured out my soul to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Don't consider your servant a wicked woman, for until now I have spoken from my deep pain and anguish."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Eli replied, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant the request that you have asked of him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She said, "May I, your servant, find favor in your sight." So the woman went her way and got something to eat. Her face no longer looked sad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They got up early the next morning and after worshiping the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, they returned to their home at Ramah. Elkanah had marital relations with his wife Hannah, and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> remembered her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">After some time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, thinking, "I asked the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">This man Elkanah went up with all his family to make the yearly sacrifice to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and to keep his vow,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">but Hannah did not go up with them. Instead she told her husband, "Once the boy is weaned, I will bring him and appear before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, and he will remain there from then on."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So her husband Elkanah said to her, "Do what you think best. Stay until you have weaned him. May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> fulfill his promise." So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Once she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with three bulls, an ephah of flour, and a container of wine. She brought him to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s house at Shiloh, even though he was young.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Once the bull had been slaughtered, they brought the boy to Eli.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">She said, "Just as surely as you are alive, my lord, I am the woman who previously stood here with you in order to pray to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I prayed for this boy, and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has given me the request that I asked of him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hannah prayed, "My heart rejoices in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>; my horn is exalted high because of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. I loudly denounce my enemies, for I am happy that you delivered me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Elkanah went back home to Ramah. But the boy was serving the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> under the supervision of Eli the priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The sons of Eli were wicked men. They did not recognize the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s authority.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now the priests would always treat the people in the following way: Whenever anyone was making a sacrifice, while the meat was boiling, the priest's attendant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He would jab it into the basin, kettle, caldron, or pot, and everything that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they used to do to all the Israelites when they came there to Shiloh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Even before they burned the fat, the priest's attendant would come and say to the person who was making the sacrifice, "Hand over some meat for the priest to roast! He won't take boiled meat from you, but only raw."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">The sin of these young men was very great in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s sight, for they treated the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s offering with contempt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now Samuel was ministering before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. The boy was dressed in a linen ephod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">His mother used to make him a small robe and bring it up to him at regular intervals when she would go up with her husband to make the annual sacrifice.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> graciously attended to Hannah, and she was able to conceive and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. The boy Samuel grew up at the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now Eli was very old when he heard about everything that his sons used to do to all the people of Israel and how they used to have sex with the women who were stationed at the entrance to the tent of meeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said to them, "Why do you behave in this way? For I hear about these evil things from all these people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This ought not to be, my sons! For the report that I hear circulating among the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s people is not good.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">A man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says: 'Did I not plainly reveal myself to your ancestor's house when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharaoh?</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the boy Samuel continued serving the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> under Eli's supervision. Word from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was rare in those days; revelatory visions were infrequent.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> again called, "Samuel!" So Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But Eli said, "I didn't call you, my son. Go back and lie down."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Samuel did not yet know the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>; the word of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had not yet been revealed to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> called Samuel a third time. So he got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me!" Eli then realized that it was the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who was calling the boy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Eli said to Samuel, "Go back and lie down. When he calls you, say, "Speak, <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, for your servant is listening." So Samuel went back and lay down in his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> came and stood nearby, calling as he had previously done, "Samuel! Samuel!" Samuel replied, "Speak, for your servant is listening!"</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Samuel revealed the word of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> to all Israel.Then the Israelites went out to fight the Philistines. They camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines camped at Aphek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Philistines arranged their forces to fight Israel. As the battle spread out, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men in the battle line in the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When the army came back to the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why did the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> let us be defeated today by the Philistines? Let's take with us the ark of the covenant of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> from Shiloh. When it is with us, it will save us from the hand of our enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So the army sent to Shiloh, and they took from there the ark of the covenant of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> of hosts who sits between the cherubim. Now the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When the ark of the covenant of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> arrived at the camp, all Israel shouted so loudly that the ground shook.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the Philistines heard the sound of the shout, they said, "What is this loud shout in the camp of the Hebrews?" Then they realized that the ark of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had arrived at the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Philistines were scared because they thought that gods had come to the camp. They said, "Too bad for us! We've never seen anything like this!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Too bad for us! Who can deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all sorts of plagues in the desert!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Be strong and act like men, you Philistines, or else you will wind up serving the Hebrews the way they have served you! Act like men and fight!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the Philistines fought. Israel was defeated; they all ran home. The slaughter was very great; thirty thousand foot soldiers fell in battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, were killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">On that day a Benjaminite ran from the battle lines and came to Shiloh. His clothes were torn and dirt was on his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When he arrived in Shiloh, Eli was sitting in his chair watching by the side of the road, for he was very worried about the ark of God. As the man entered the city to give his report, the whole city cried out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When Eli heard the outcry, he said, "What is this commotion?" The man quickly came and told Eli.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes looked straight ahead; he was unable to see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The man said to Eli, "I am the one who came from the battle lines! Just today I fled from the battle lines!" Eli asked, "How did things go, my son?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The messenger replied, "Israel has fled from the Philistines! The army has suffered a great defeat! Your two sons, Hophni and Phineas, are dead! The ark of God has been captured!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward from his chair beside the gate. He broke his neck and died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel for forty years.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">As she was dying, the women who were there with her said, "Don't be afraid! You have given birth to a son!" But she did not reply or pay any attention.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">When the residents of Ashdod got up early the next day, Dagon was lying on the ground before the ark of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. So they took Dagon and set him back in his place.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">So they assembled all the leaders of the Philistines and asked, "What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?" They replied, "The ark of the God of Israel should be moved to Gath." So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But after it had been moved the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> attacked that city as well, causing a great deal of panic. He struck all the people of that city with sores.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.But when the ark of God arrived at Ekron, the residents of Ekron cried out saying, "They have brought the ark of the God of Israel here to kill our people!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So they assembled all the leaders of the Philistines and said, "Get the ark of the God of Israel out of here!

      <VERS vnumber="12">The people who did not die were struck with sores; the city's cry for help went all the way up to heaven.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When the ark of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had been in the land of the Philistines for seven months,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">They replied, "If you are going to send the ark of the God of Israel back, don't send it away empty. Be sure to return it with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why his hand is not removed from you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They inquired, "What is the guilt offering that we should send to him?"They replied, "The Philistine leaders number five. So send five gold sores and five gold mice, for it is the same plague that has afflicted both you and your leaders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You should make images of the sores and images of the mice that are destroying the land. You should honor the God of Israel. Perhaps he will release his grip on you, your gods, and your land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Why harden your hearts like the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When God treated them harshly, didn't the Egyptians send the Israelites on their way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So now go and make a new cart. Get two cows that have calves and that have never had a yoke placed on them. Harness the cows to the cart and take their calves from them back to their stalls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then take the ark of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and place it on the cart, and put in a chest beside it the gold objects you are sending to him as a guilt offering. You should then send it on its way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But keep an eye on it. If it should go up by the way of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then he has brought this great calamity on us. But if that is not the case, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us; rather, it just happened to us by accident."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the men did as instructed. They took two cows that had calves and harnessed them to a cart; they also removed their calves to their stalls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They put the ark of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> on the cart, along with the chest, the gold mice, and the images of the sores.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the cows went directly on the road to Beth Shemesh. They went along, mooing as they went; they turned neither to the right nor to the left. The leaders of the Philistines were walking along behind them all the way to the border of Beth Shemesh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">But the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> struck down some of the people of Beth Shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>; he struck down 50,070 of the men.

      <VERS vnumber="20">The residents of Beth Shemesh asked, "Who is able to stand before the Lord, this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?"</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the people of Kiriath Jearim came and took the ark of the Lord; they brought it to the house of Abinadab located on the hill. They consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It was quite a long time - some twenty years in all - that the ark stayed at Kiriath Jearim. All the people of Israel longed for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">So the Israelites removed the Baals and images of Ashtoreth. They served only the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> on your behalf."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. They fasted on that day, and they confessed there, "We have sinned against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>." So Samuel led the people of Israel at Mizpah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the leaders of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the Israelites heard about this, they were afraid of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Israelites said to Samuel, "Keep crying out to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God so that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. Samuel cried out to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> on Israel's behalf, and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> answered him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As Samuel was offering burnt offerings, the Philistines approached to do battle with Israel. But on that day the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> thundered loudly against the Philistines. He caused them to panic, and they were defeated by Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Samuel took a stone and placed it between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, "Up to here the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has helped us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So the Philistines were defeated; they did not invade Israel again. The hand of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The cities that the Philistines had captured from Israel were returned to Israel, from Ekron to Gath. Israel also delivered their territory from the control of the Philistines. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Year after year he used to travel the circuit of Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; he used to judge Israel in all of these places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he would return to Ramah, because his home was there. He also judged Israel there and built an altar to the LORD there.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">So all the elders of Israel gathered together and approached Samuel at Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They said to him, "Look, you are old, and your sons don't follow your ways. So now appoint over us a king to lead us, just like all the other nations have."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But this request displeased Samuel, for they said, "Give us a king to lead us." So Samuel prayed to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Samuel, "Do everything the people request of you. For it is not you that they have rejected, but it is me that they have rejected as their king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Just as they have done from the day that I brought them up from Egypt until this very day, they have rejected me and have served other gods. This is what they are also doing to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So now do as they say. But seriously warn them and make them aware of the policies of the king who will rule over them."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">He said, "Here are the policies of the king who will rule over you: He will conscript your sons and put them in his chariot forces and in his cavalry; they will run in front of his chariot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He will appoint for himself leaders of thousands and leaders of fifties, as well as those who plow his ground, reap his harvest, and make his weapons of war and his chariot equipment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He will take your daughters to be ointment makers, cooks, and bakers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He will take your best fields and vineyards and give them to his own servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He will demand a tenth of your seed and of the produce of your vineyards and give it to his administrators and his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He will take your male and female servants, as well as your best cattle and your donkeys, and assign them for his own use.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He will demand a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will be his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In that day you will cry out because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> won't answer you in that day."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But the people refused to heed Samuel's warning. Instead they said, "No! There will be a king over us!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We will be like all the other nations. Our king will judge us and lead us and fight our battles."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So Samuel listened to everything the people said and then reported it to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The LORD said to Samuel, "Do as they say and install a king over them." Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, "Each of you go back to his own city."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a Benjaminite man named Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin. He was a prominent person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He had a son named Saul, a handsome young man. There was no one among the Israelites more handsome than he was; he stood head and shoulders above all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The donkeys of Saul's father Kish wandered off, so Kish said to his son Saul, "Take one of the servants with you and go look for the donkeys."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So Saul crossed through the hill country of Ephraim, passing through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find them. So they crossed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then he crossed through the land of Benjamin, and still they did not find them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, "Come on, let's head back before my father quits worrying about the donkeys and becomes anxious about us!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the servant said to him, "Look, there is a man of God in this town. He is highly respected. Everything that he says really happens. Now let's go there. Perhaps he will tell us where we should go from here."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Saul said to his servant, "All right, we can go. But what can we bring the man, since the food in our bags is used up? We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The servant went on to answer Saul, "Look, I happen to have in my hand a quarter shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God and he will tell us where we should go."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">(Now it used to be in Israel that whenever someone went to inquire of God he would say, "Come on, let's go to the seer." For today's prophet used to be called a seer.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So Saul said to his servant, "That's a good idea! Come on. Let's go." So they went to the town where the man of God was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As they were going up the ascent to the town, they met some girls coming out to draw water. They said to them, "Is this where the seer is?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They replied, "Yes, straight ahead! But hurry now, for he came to the town today, and the people are making a sacrifice at the high place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When you enter the town, you can find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people won't eat until he arrives, for he must bless the sacrifice. Once that happens, those who have been invited will eat. Now go on up, for this is the time when you can find him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So they went up to the town. As they were heading for the middle of the town, Samuel was coming in their direction to go up to the high place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now the day before Saul arrived, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had told Samuel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"At this time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin. You must consecrate him as a leader over my people Israel. He will save my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have looked with favor on my people. Their cry has reached me!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When Samuel saw Saul, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "Here is the man that I told you about! He will rule over my people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate, he said, "Please tell me where the seer's house is."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Samuel replied to Saul, "I am the seer! Go up in front of me to the high place! Today you will eat with me and in the morning I will send you away. I will tell you everything that you are thinking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Don't be concerned about the donkeys that you lost three days ago, for they have been found. Whom does all Israel desire? Is it not you, and all your father's family?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Saul replied, "Am I not a Benjaminite, from the smallest of Israel's tribes, and is not my family clan the smallest of all the tribes of Benjamin? Why do you speak to me in this way?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the room and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited. There were about thirty people present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Samuel said to the cook, "Give me the portion of meat that I gave to you - the one I asked you to keep with you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So the cook picked up the leg and brought it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, "What was kept is now set before you! Eat, for it has been kept for you for this meeting time, from the time I said, 'I have invited the people.'" So Saul ate with Samuel that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They got up at dawn and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get up, so I can send you on your way." So Saul got up and the two of them - he and Samuel - went outside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">While they were going down to the edge of town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead of us." So he did. Samuel then said, "You remain here awhile, so I can inform you of God's message."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Samuel took a small container of olive oil and poured it on Saul's head. Samuel kissed him and said, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has chosen you  to lead his people Israel! You will rule over the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s people and you will deliver them from the power of the enemies who surround them. This will be your sign that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has chosen you as leader over his inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When you leave me today, you will find two men near Rachel's tomb at Zelzah on Benjamin's border. They will say to you, 'The donkeys you have gone looking for have been found. Your father is no longer concerned about the donkeys but has become anxious about you two! He is asking, "What should I do about my son?"'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"As you continue on from there, you will come to the tall tree of Tabor. At that point three men who are going up to God at Bethel will meet you. One of them will be carrying three young goats, one of them will be carrying three round loaves of bread, and one of them will be carrying a container of wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They will ask you how you're doing and will give you two loaves of bread. You will accept them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Afterward you will go to Gibeah of God, where there are Philistine officials. When you enter the town, you will meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place. They will have harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres, and they will be prophesying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the spirit of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will rush upon you and you will prophesy with them. You will be changed into a different person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"When these signs have taken place, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God will be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You will go down to Gilgal before me. I am going to join you there to offer burnt offerings and to make peace offerings. You should wait for seven days, until I arrive and tell you what to do."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed his inmost person. All these signs happened on that very day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a company of prophets was coming out to meet him. Then the spirit of God rushed upon Saul and he prophesied among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When everyone who had known him previously saw him prophesying with the prophets, the people all asked one another, "What on earth has happened to the son of Kish? Does even Saul belong with the prophets?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A man who was from there replied, "And who is their father?" Therefore this became a proverb: "Is even Saul among the prophets?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Saul had finished prophesying, he went to the high place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, "Where did you go?" Saul replied, "To look for the donkeys. But when we realized they were lost, we went to Samuel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Saul's uncle said, "Tell me what Samuel said to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Saul said to his uncle, "He assured us that the donkeys had been found." But Saul did not tell him what Samuel had said about the matter of kingship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Samuel called the people together before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> at Mizpah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said to the Israelites, "This is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel says, 'I brought Israel up from Egypt and I delivered you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But today you have rejected your God who saves you from all your trouble and distress. You have said, "No! Appoint a king over us." Now take your positions before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> by your tribes and by your clans.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen by lot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the family of Matri was chosen by lot. At last Saul son of Kish was chosen by lot. But when they looked for him, he was nowhere to be found.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So they inquired again of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "Has the man arrived here yet?" The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "He has hidden himself among the equipment."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So they ran and brought him from there. When he took his position among the people, he stood head and shoulders above them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see the one whom the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has chosen? Indeed, there is no one like him among all the people!" All the people shouted out, "Long live the king!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Samuel talked to the people about how the kingship would work. He wrote it all down on a scroll and set it before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. Then Samuel sent all the people away to their homes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Even Saul went to his home in Gibeah. With him went some brave men whose hearts God had touched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But some wicked men said, "How can this man save us?" They despised him and did not even bring him a gift. But Saul said nothing about it.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Nahash the Ammonite marched against Jabesh Gilead. All the men of Jabesh Gilead said to Nahash, "Make a treaty with us and we will serve you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, "The only way I will make a treaty with you is if you let me gouge out the right eye of every one of you and in so doing humiliate all Israel!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The elders of Jabesh said to him, "Leave us alone for seven days so that we can send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. If there is no one who can deliver us, we will come out voluntarily to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the messengers went to Gibeah (where Saul lived) and informed the people of these matters, all the people wept loudly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Saul was walking behind the oxen as he came from the field. Saul asked, "What has happened to the people? Why are they weeping?" So they told him about the men of Jabesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and he became very angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He took a pair of oxen and cut them up. Then he sent the pieces throughout the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, who said, "Whoever does not go out after Saul and after Samuel should expect this to be done to his oxen!" Then the terror of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> fell on the people, and they went out as one army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Saul counted them at Bezek, the Israelites were 300,000 strong and the men of Judah numbered 30,000.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They said to the messengers who had come, "Here's what you should say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: 'Tomorrow deliverance will come to you when the sun is fully up.'" When the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh Gilead, they were happy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The men of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will come out to you and you can do with us whatever you wish."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The next day Saul placed the people in three groups. They went to the Ammonite camp during the morning watch and struck them down until the hottest part of the day. The survivors scattered; no two of them remained together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the people said to Samuel, "Who were the ones asking, 'Will Saul reign over us?' Hand over those men so we may execute them!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Saul said, "No one will be killed on this day. For today the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has given Israel a victory!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Samuel said to the people, "Come on! Let's go to Gilgal and renew the kingship there."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Saul was [thirty] years old when he began to reign; he ruled over Israel for [forty] years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Saul selected for himself three thousand men from Israel. Two thousand of these were with Saul at Micmash and in the hill country of Bethel; the remaining thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin. He sent all the rest of the people back home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost that was at Geba and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul alerted all the land saying, "Let the Hebrews pay attention!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">All Israel heard this message, "Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel is repulsive to the Philistines!" So the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For the battle with Israel the Philistines had amassed 3,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen, and an army as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The men of Israel realized they had a problem because their army was hard pressed. So the army hid in caves, thickets, cliffs, strongholds, and cisterns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan River to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul stayed at Gilgal; the entire army that was with him was terrified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He waited for seven days, the time period indicated by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the army began to abandon Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Saul said, "Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings." Then he offered a burnt offering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Just when he had finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel appeared on the scene. Saul went out to meet him and to greet him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Samuel said, "What have you done?" Saul replied, "When I saw that the army had started to abandon me and that you didn't come at the appointed time and that the Philistines had assembled at Micmash,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I thought, 'Now the Philistines will come down on me at Gilgal and I have not sought the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s favor.' So I felt obligated to offer the burnt offering."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Samuel said to Saul, "You have made a foolish choice! You have not obeyed the commandment that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God gave you.

      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Samuel set out and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin. Saul mustered the army that remained with him; there were about six hundred men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">A blacksmith could not be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, "This will prevent the Hebrews from making swords and spears."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Jonathan replied, "All right! We'll go over to these men and fight them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If they say to us, 'Stay put until we approach you,' we will stay right there and not go up to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if they say, 'Come up against us,' we will go up. For in that case the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has given them into our hand - it will be a sign to us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When they made themselves known to the Philistine garrison, the Philistines said, "Look! The Hebrews are coming out of the holes in which they hid themselves."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the men of the garrison said to Jonathan and his armor bearer, "Come on up to us so we can teach you a thing or two!" Then Jonathan said to his armor bearer, "Come up behind me, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has given them into the hand of Israel!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jonathan crawled up on his hands and feet, with his armor bearer following behind him. Jonathan struck down the Philistines, while his armor bearer came along behind him and killed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In this initial skirmish Jonathan and his armor bearer struck down about twenty men in an area that measured half an acre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then fear overwhelmed those who were in the camp, those who were in the field, all the army in the garrison, and the raiding bands. They trembled and the ground shook. This fear was caused by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Saul's watchmen at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin looked on as the crowd of soldiers seemed to melt away first in one direction and then in another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So Saul said to the army that was with him, "Muster the troops and see who is no longer with us." When they mustered the troops, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring near the ephod," for he was at that time wearing the ephod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">While Saul spoke to the priest, the panic in the Philistines' camp was becoming greater and greater. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Saul and all the army that was with him assembled and marched into battle, where they found the Philistines in total panic killing one another with their swords.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The Hebrews who had earlier gone over to the Philistine side joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When all the Israelites who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, they too pursued them in battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> delivered Israel that day, and the battle shifted over to Beth Aven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now the men of Israel were hard pressed that day, for Saul had made the army agree to this oath: "Cursed be the man who eats food before evening! I will get my vengeance on my enemies!" So no one in the army ate anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now the whole army entered the forest and there was honey on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the army entered the forest, they saw the honey flowing, but no one ate any of it, for the army was afraid of the oath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Jonathan had not heard about the oath his father had made the army take. He extended the end of his staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb. When he ate it, his eyes gleamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then someone from the army informed him, "Your father put the army under a strict oath saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats food today!' That is why the army is tired."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Jonathan said, "My father has caused trouble for the land. See how my eyes gleamed when I tasted just a little of this honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Certainly if the army had eaten some of the enemies' provisions that they came across today, would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">On that day the army struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon, and they became very tired.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So the army rushed greedily on the plunder, confiscating sheep, cattle, and calves. They slaughtered them right on the ground, and the army ate them blood and all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now it was reported to Saul, "Look, the army is sinning against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> by eating even the blood." He said, "All of you have broken the covenant! Roll a large stone over here to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Saul said, "Scatter out among the army and say to them, 'Each of you bring to me your ox and sheep and slaughter them in this spot and eat. But don't sin against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> by eating the blood." So that night each one brought his ox and slaughtered it there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then Saul built an altar for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>; it was the first time he had built an altar for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Saul said, "Let's go down after the Philistines at night; we will rout them until the break of day. We won't leave any of them alive!" They replied, "Do whatever seems best to you." But the priest said, "Let's approach God here."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So Saul asked God, "Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?" But he did not answer him that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then Saul said, "All you leaders of the army come here. Find out how this sin occurred today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For as surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, the deliverer of Israel, lives, even if it turns out to be my own son Jonathan, he will certainly die!" But no one from the army said anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then he said to all Israel, "You will be on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other side." The army replied to Saul, "Do whatever you think is best."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then Saul said, "O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel! If this sin has been committed by me or by my son Jonathan, then, O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel, respond with Urim. But if this sin has been committed by your people Israel, respond with Thummim." Then Jonathan and Saul were indicated by lot, while the army was exonerated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Then Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan!" Jonathan was indicated by lot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">So Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." Jonathan told him, "I used the end of the staff that was in my hand to taste a little honey. I must die!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Saul said, "God will punish me severely if Jonathan doesn't die!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But the army said to Saul, "Should Jonathan, who won this great victory in Israel, die? May it never be! As surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives, not a single hair of his head will fall to the ground! For it is with the help of God that he has acted today." So the army rescued Jonathan from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then Saul stopped chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines went back home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">After Saul had secured his royal position over Israel, he fought against all their enemies on all sides - the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. In every direction that he turned he was victorious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He fought bravely, striking down the Amalekites and delivering Israel from the hand of its enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua. He had two daughters; the older one was named Merab and the younger Michal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the general in command of his army was Abner son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">There was fierce war with the Philistines all the days of Saul. So whenever Saul saw anyone who was a warrior or a brave individual, he would conscript him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Samuel said to Saul, "I was the one the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> sent to anoint you as king over his people Israel. Now listen to what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Here is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> of hosts says: 'I carefully observed how the Amalekites opposed Israel along the way when Israel came up from Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So go now and strike down the Amalekites. Destroy everything that they have. Don't spare them. Put them to death - man, woman, child, infant, ox, sheep, camel, and donkey alike.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So Saul assembled the army and mustered them at Telaim. There were 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Saul proceeded to the city of Amalek, where he set an ambush in the wadi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Saul said to the Kenites, "Go on and leave! Go down from among the Amalekites! Otherwise I will sweep you away with them! After all, you were kind to all the Israelites when they came up from Egypt." So the Kenites withdrew from among the Amalekites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Saul struck down the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, which is next to Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He captured King Agag of the Amalekites alive, but he executed all Agag's people with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">However, Saul and the army spared Agag, along with the best of the flock, the cattle, the fatlings, and the lambs, as well as everything else that was of value. They were not willing to slaughter them. But they did slaughter everything that was despised and worthless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the word of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> came to Samuel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from me and has not done what I told him to do." Samuel became angry and he cried out to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> all that night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Samuel got up early to meet Saul the next morning. But Samuel was informed, "Saul has gone to Carmel where he is setting up a monument for himself. Then Samuel left and went down to Gilgal."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Samuel came to him, Saul said to him, "May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> bless you! I have done what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Samuel replied, "If that is the case, then what is this sound of sheep in my ears and the sound of cattle that I hear?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Saul said, "They were brought from the Amalekites; the army spared the best of the flocks and cattle to sacrifice to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God. But everything else we slaughtered."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Samuel said to Saul, "Wait a minute! Let me tell you what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to me last night." Saul said to him, "Tell me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Samuel said, "Is it not true that when you were insignificant in your own eyes, you became head of the tribes of Israel? The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> chose you as king over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> sent you on a campaign saying, 'Go and exterminate those sinful Amalekites! Fight against them until you have destroyed them.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Why haven't you obeyed the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>? Instead you have greedily rushed upon the plunder! You have done what is wrong in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s estimation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Saul said to Samuel, "But I have obeyed the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>! I went on the campaign the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> sent me on. I brought back King Agag of the Amalekites after exterminating the Amalekites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But the army took from the plunder some of the sheep and cattle - the best of what was to be slaughtered - to sacrifice to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God in Gilgal."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Samuel said,"Does the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> take pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as he does in obedience? Certainly, obedience is better than sacrifice; paying attention is better than the fat of rams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and presumption is like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, he has rejected you as king."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned, for I have disobeyed what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> commanded and what you said as well. For I was afraid of the army, and I followed their wishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now please forgive my sin! Go back with me so I can worship the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Samuel said to Saul, "I will not go back with you, for you have rejected the word of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has rejected you from being king over Israel!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When Samuel turned to leave, Saul grabbed the edge of his robe and it tore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Samuel said to him, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to one of your colleagues who is better than you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The Preeminent One of Israel does not go back on his word or change his mind, for he is not a human being who changes his mind."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Saul again replied, "I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel. Go back with me so I may worship the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So Samuel followed Saul back, and Saul worshiped the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then Samuel said, "Bring me King Agag of the Amalekites." So Agag came to him trembling, thinking to himself, "Surely death is bitter!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Samuel said, "Just as your sword left women childless, so your mother will be the most bereaved among women!" Then Samuel hacked Agag to pieces there in Gilgal before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Samuel went to Ramah, while Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Until the day he died Samuel did not see Saul again. Samuel did, however, mourn for Saul, but the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Samuel, "How long do you intend to mourn for Saul? I have rejected him as king over Israel. Fill your horn with olive oil and go! I am sending you to Jesse in Bethlehem,  for I have selected a king for myself from among his sons."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Samuel replied, "How can I go? Saul will hear about it and kill me!" But the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "Take a heifer with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you should do. You will anoint for me the one I point out to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Samuel did what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> told him. When he arrived in Bethlehem, the elders of the city were afraid to meet him. They said, "Do you come in peace?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He replied, "Yes, in peace. I have come to sacrifice to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice." So he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they arrived, Samuel noticed Eliab and said to himself, "Surely, here before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> stands his chosen king!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Samuel, "Don't be impressed by his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. God does not view things the way men do. People look on the outward appearance, but the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> looks at the heart."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel. But Samuel said, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has not chosen this one, either."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesse presented Shammah. But Samuel said, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has not chosen this one either."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesse presented seven of his sons to Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has not chosen any of these."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Samuel said to Jesse, "Is that all of the young men?" Jesse replied, "There is still the youngest one, but he's taking care of the flock." Samuel said to Jesse, "Send and get him, for we cannot turn our attention to other things until he comes here."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Jesse had him brought in. Now he was ruddy, with attractive eyes and a handsome appearance. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "Go and anoint him. This is the one!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Samuel took the horn full of olive oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers. The Spirit of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> rushed upon David from that day onward. Then Samuel got up and went to Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the Spirit of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had turned away from Saul, and an evil spirit from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> tormented him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Saul's servants said to him, "Look, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let our lord instruct his servants who are here before you to look for a man who knows how to play the lyre. Then whenever the evil spirit from God comes upon you, he can play the lyre and you will feel better."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So Saul said to his servants, "Find me a man who plays well and bring him to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">One of his attendants replied, "I have seen a son of Jesse in Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is a brave warrior and is articulate and handsome, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is with him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me your son David, who is out with the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a container of wine, and a young goat and sent them to Saul with his son David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">David came to Saul and stood before him. Saul liked him a great deal, and he became his armor bearer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Saul sent word to Jesse saying, "Let David be my servant, for I really like him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So whenever the spirit from God would come upon Saul, David would take his lyre and play it. This would bring relief to Saul and make him feel better. Then the evil spirit would leave him alone.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Philistines gathered their troops for battle. They assembled at Socoh in Judah. They camped in Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Saul and the Israelite army assembled and camped in the valley of Elah, where they arranged their battle lines to fight against the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The Philistines were standing on one hill, and the Israelites on another hill, with the valley between them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then a champion came out from the camp of the Philistines. His name was Goliath; he was from Gath. He was close to seven feet tall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He had a bronze helmet on his head and was wearing scale body armor. The weight of his bronze body armor was five thousand shekels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He had bronze shin guards on his legs, and a bronze javelin was slung over his shoulders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the iron point of his spear weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer was walking before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Goliath stood and called to Israel's troops, "Why do you come out to prepare for battle? Am I not the Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose for yourselves a man so he may come down to me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If he is able to fight with me and strike me down, we will become your servants. But if I prevail against him and strike him down, you will become our servants and will serve us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the Philistine said, "I defy Israel's troops this day! Give me a man so we can fight each other!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When Saul and all the Israelites heard these words of the Philistine, they were upset and very afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now David was the son of this Ephrathite named Jesse from Bethlehem in Judah. He had eight sons, and in Saul's days he was old and well advanced in years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to war. The names of the three sons who went to war were Eliab, his firstborn, Abinadab, the second oldest, and Shammah, the third oldest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now David was the youngest. While the three oldest sons followed Saul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">David was going back and forth from Saul in order to care for his father's sheep in Bethlehem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Meanwhile for forty days the Philistine approached every morning and evening and took his position.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesse said to his son David, "Take your brothers this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread; go quickly to the camp to your brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Also take these ten portions of cheese to their commanding officer. Find out how your brothers are doing and bring back their pledge that they received the goods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They are with Saul and the whole Israelite army in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So David got up early in the morning and entrusted the flock to someone else who would watch over it. After loading up, he went just as Jesse had instructed him. He arrived at the camp as the army was going out to the battle lines shouting its battle cry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Israel and the Philistines drew up their battle lines opposite one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After David had entrusted his cargo to the care of the supply officer, he ran to the battlefront. When he arrived, he asked his brothers how they were doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As he was speaking with them, the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, was coming up from the battle lines of the Philistines. He spoke the way he usually did, and David heard it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When all the men of Israel saw this man, they retreated from his presence and were very afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The men of Israel said, "Have you seen this man who is coming up? He does so to defy Israel. But the king will make the man who can strike him down very wealthy! He will give him his daughter in marriage, and he will make his father's house exempt from tax obligations in Israel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">David asked the men who were standing near him, "What will be done for the man who strikes down this Philistine and frees Israel from this humiliation? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he defies the armies of the living God?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The soldiers told him what had been promised, saying, "This is what will be done for the man who can strike him down."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When David's oldest brother Eliab heard him speaking to the men, he became angry with David and said, "Why have you come down here? To whom did you entrust those few sheep in the desert? I am familiar with your pride and deceit! You have come down here to watch the battle!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">David replied, "What have I done now? Can't I say anything?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then he turned from those who were nearby to someone else and asked the same question, but they gave him the same answer as before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When David's words were overheard and reported to Saul, he called for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">David said to Saul, "Don't let anyone be discouraged. Your servant will go and fight this Philistine!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But Saul replied to David, "You aren't able to go against this Philistine and fight him! You're just a boy! He has been a warrior from his youth!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">David replied to Saul, "Your servant has been a shepherd for his father's flock. Whenever a lion or bear would come and carry off a sheep from the flock,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I would go out after it, strike it down, and rescue the sheep from its mouth. If it rose up against me, I would grab it by its jaw, strike it, and kill it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Your servant has struck down both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine will be just like one of them. For he has defied the armies of the living God!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">David went on to say, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who delivered me from the lion and the bear will also deliver me from the hand of this Philistine!" Then Saul said to David, "Go! The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will be with you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then Saul clothed David with his own fighting attire and put a bronze helmet on his head. He also put body armor on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">David strapped on his sword over his fighting attire and tried to walk around, but he was not used to them. David said to Saul, "I can't walk in these things, for I'm not used to them." So David removed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He took his staff in his hand, picked out five smooth stones from the stream, placed them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag, took his sling in hand, and approached the Philistine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Philistine kept coming closer to David, with his shield bearer walking in front of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">When the Philistine looked carefully at David, he despised him, for he was only a ruddy and handsome boy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog, that you are coming after me with sticks?" Then the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The Philistine said to David, "Come here to me, so I can give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the field!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But David replied to the Philistine, "You are coming against me with sword and spear and javelin. But I am coming against you in the name of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> of hosts, the God of Israel's armies, whom you have defied!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">This very day the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will deliver you into my hand! I will strike you down and cut off your head. This day I will give the corpses of the Philistine army to the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the land. Then all the land will realize that Israel has a God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">and all this assembly will know that it is not by sword or spear that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> saves! For the battle is the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s, and he will deliver you into our hand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">The Philistine drew steadily closer to David to attack him, while David quickly ran toward the battle line to attack the Philistine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">David reached his hand into the bag and took out a stone. He slung it, striking the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank deeply into his forehead, and he fell down with his face to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">David prevailed over the Philistine with just the sling and the stone. He struck down the Philistine and killed him. David did not even have a sword in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">David ran and stood over the Philistine. He grabbed Goliath's sword, drew it from its sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they ran away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then the men of Israel and Judah charged forward, shouting a battle cry. They chased the Philistines to the valley and to the very gates of Ekron. The Philistine corpses lay fallen along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">When the Israelites returned from their hot pursuit of the Philistines, they looted their camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put Goliath's weapons in his tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Now as Saul watched David going out to fight the Philistine, he asked Abner, the general in command of the army, "Whose son is this young man, Abner?" Abner replied, "As surely as you live, O king, I don't know."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">The king said, "Find out whose son this boy is!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">So when David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. He still had the head of the Philistine in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Saul said to him, "Whose son are you, young man?" David replied, "I am the son of your servant Jesse in Bethlehem."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan and David became bound together in close friendship. Jonathan loved David as much as he did his own life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Saul retained David on that day and did not allow him to return to his father's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jonathan made a covenant with David, for he loved him as much as he did his own life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with the rest of his gear, including his sword, his bow, and even his belt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">On every mission on which Saul sent him, David achieved success. So Saul appointed him over the men of war. This pleased not only all the army, but also Saul's servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the men arrived after David returned from striking down the Philistine, the women from all the cities of Israel came out singing and dancing to meet King Saul. They were happy as they played their tambourines and three-stringed instruments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The women who were playing the music sang,"Saul has struck down his thousands, but David his tens of thousands!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This made Saul very angry. The statement displeased him and he thought, "They have attributed to David tens of thousands, but to me they have attributed only thousands. What does he lack, except the kingdom?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Saul was keeping an eye on David from that day onward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The next day an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul and he prophesied within his house. Now David was playing the lyre that day. There was a spear in Saul's hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and Saul threw the spear, thinking, "I'll nail David to the wall!" But David escaped from him on two different occasions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Saul feared David, because the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was with him but had departed from Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Saul removed David from his presence and made him a commanding officer. David led the army out to battle and back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now David achieved success in all he did, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When Saul saw how very successful he was, he was afraid of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he was the one leading them out to battle and back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Saul said to David, "Here's my oldest daughter, Merab. I want to give her to you in marriage. Only be a brave warrior for me and fight the battles of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>." For Saul thought, "There's no need for me to raise my hand against him. Let it be the hand of the Philistines!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">David said to Saul, "Who am I? Who are my relatives or the clan of my father in Israel that I should become the king's son-in-law?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she instead was given in marriage to Adriel, who was from Meholah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David. When they told Saul about this, it pleased him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Saul said, "I will give her to him so that she may become a snare to him and the hand of the Philistines may be against him." So Saul said to David, "Today is the second time for you to become my son-in-law."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Saul instructed his servants, "Tell David secretly, 'The king is pleased with you, and all his servants like you. So now become the king's son-in-law."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So Saul's servants spoke these words privately to David. David replied, "Is becoming the king's son-in-law something insignificant to you? I'm just a poor and lightly-esteemed man!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When Saul's servants reported what David had said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Saul replied, "Here is what you should say to David: 'There is nothing that the king wants as a price for the bride except a hundred Philistine foreskins, so that he can be avenged of his enemies.'" (Now Saul was thinking that he could kill David by the hand of the Philistines.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So his servants told David these things and David agreed to become the king's son-in-law. Now the specified time had not yet expired</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">when David, along with his men, went out and struck down two hundred Philistine men. David brought their foreskins and presented all of them to the king so he could become the king's son-in-law. Saul then gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When Saul realized that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Saul became even more afraid of him. Saul continued to be at odds with David from then on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the leaders of the Philistines would march out, and as often as they did so, David achieved more success than all of Saul's servants. His name was held in high esteem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Saul told his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David. But Saul's son Jonathan liked David very much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So Jonathan told David, "My father Saul is trying to kill you. So be careful tomorrow morning. Find a hiding place and stay in seclusion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are. I will speak about you to my father. When I find out what the problem is, I will let you know."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So Jonathan spoke on David's behalf to his father Saul. He said to him, "The king should not sin against his servant David, for he has not sinned against you. On the contrary, his actions have been very beneficial for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He risked his life when he struck down the Philistine and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> gave all Israel a great victory. When you saw it, you were happy. So why would you sin against innocent blood by putting David to death for no reason?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Saul accepted Jonathan's advice and took an oath, "As surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives, he will not be put to death."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Jonathan called David and told him all these things. Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he served him as he had done formerly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now once again there was war. So David went out to fight the Philistines. He defeated them thoroughly and they ran away from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then an evil spirit from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> came upon Saul. He was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, while David was playing the lyre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Saul tried to nail David to the wall with the spear, but he escaped from Saul's presence and the spear drove into the wall. David escaped quickly that night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Saul sent messengers to David's house to guard it and to kill him in the morning. Then David's wife Michal told him, "If you do not save yourself tonight, tomorrow you will be dead!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Michal lowered David through the window, and he ran away and escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Michal took a household idol and put it on the bed. She put a quilt made of goat's hair over its head and then covered the idol with a garment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When Saul sent messengers to arrest David, she said, "He's sick."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Saul sent the messengers back to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me on his bed so I can kill him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When the messengers came, they found only the idol on the bed and the quilt made of goat's hair at its head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Saul said to Michal, "Why have you deceived me this way by sending my enemy away? Now he has escaped!" Michal replied to Saul, "He said to me, 'Help me get away or else I will kill you!'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now David had run away and escaped. He went to Samuel in Ramah and told him everything that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed at Naioth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It was reported to Saul saying, "David is at Naioth in Ramah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So Saul sent messengers to capture David. When they saw a company of prophets prophesying with Samuel standing there as their leader, the spirit of God came upon Saul's messengers, and they also prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When it was reported to Saul, he sent more messengers, but they prophesied too. So Saul sent messengers a third time, but they also prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Finally Saul himself went to Ramah. When he arrived at the large cistern that is in Secu, he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" They said, "At Naioth in Ramah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So Saul went to Naioth in Ramah. The Spirit of God came upon him as well, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He even stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel. He lay there naked all that day and night. (For that reason it is asked, "Is Saul also among the prophets?")</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came to Jonathan and asked, "What have I done? What is my offense? How have I sinned before your father? For he is seeking my life!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jonathan said to him, "By no means are you going to die! My father does nothing large or small without making me aware of it. Why would my father hide this matter from me? It just won't happen!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Taking an oath, David again said, "Your father is very much aware of the fact that I have found favor with you, and he has thought, 'Don't let Jonathan know about this, or he will be upset.' But as surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives and you live, there is about one step between me and death!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jonathan replied to David, "Tell me what I can do for you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David said to Jonathan, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and I am certainly expected to join the king for a meal. You must send me away so I can hide in the field until the third evening from now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If your father happens to miss me, you should say, 'David urgently requested me to let him go to his city Bethlehem, for there is an annual sacrifice there for his entire family.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If he should then say, 'That's fine,' then your servant is safe. But if he becomes very angry, be assured that he has decided to harm me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You must be loyal to your servant, for you have made a covenant with your servant in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s name. If I am guilty, you yourself kill me! Why bother taking me to your father?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jonathan said, "Far be it from you to suggest this! If I were at all aware that my father had decided to harm you, wouldn't I tell you about it?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">David said to Jonathan, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jonathan said to David, "Come on. Let's go out to the field."When the two of them had gone out into the field,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jonathan said to David, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel is my witness. I will feel out my father about this time the day after tomorrow. If he is favorably inclined toward David, will I not then send word to you and let you know?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But if my father intends to do you harm, may the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> do all this and more to Jonathan, if I don't let you know and send word to you so you can go safely on your way. May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> be with you, as he was with my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">While I am still alive, extend to me the loyalty of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, or else I will die!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Don't ever cut off your loyalty to my family, not even when the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and called David's enemies to account." So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jonathan once again took an oath with David, because he loved him. In fact Jonathan loved him as much as he did his own life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, for your seat will be empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">On the third day you should go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself the day this all started. Stay near the stone Ezel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I will shoot three arrows near it, as though I were shooting at a target.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When I send a boy after them, I will say, "Go and find the arrows." If I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you; get them,' then come back. For as surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives, you will be safe and there will no problem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But if I say to the boy, "Look, the arrows are on the other side of you,' get away. For in that case the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has sent you away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">With regard to the matter that you and I discussed, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is the witness between us forever!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So David hid in the field. When the new moon came, the king sat down to eat his meal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The king sat down in his usual place by the wall, with Jonathan opposite him and Abner at his side. But David's place was vacant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">However, Saul said nothing about it that day, for he thought, "Something has happened to make him ceremonially unclean. Yes, he must be unclean."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But the next morning, the second day of the new moon, David's place was still vacant. So Saul said to his son Jonathan, "Why has Jesse's son not come to the meal yesterday or today?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Jonathan replied to Saul, "David urgently requested that he be allowed to go to Bethlehem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He said, 'Permit me to go, for we are having a family sacrifice in the city, and my brother urged me to be there. So now, if I have found favor with you, let me go to see my brothers.' For that reason he has not come to the king's table."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Saul became angry with Jonathan and said to him, "You stupid traitor! Don't I realize that to your own disgrace and to the disgrace of your mother's nakedness you have chosen this son of Jesse?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For as long as this son of Jesse is alive on the earth, you and your kingdom will not be established. Now, send some men and bring him to me. For he is as good as dead!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jonathan responded to his father Saul, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan in order to strike him down. So Jonathan was convinced that his father had decided to kill David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jonathan got up from the table enraged. He did not eat any food on that second day of the new moon, for he was upset that his father had humiliated David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The next morning Jonathan, along with a young servant, went out to the field to meet David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He said to his servant, "Run, find the arrows that I am about to shoot." As the servant ran, Jonathan shot the arrow beyond him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">When the servant came to the place where Jonathan had shot the arrow, Jonathan called out to the servant, "Isn't the arrow further beyond you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jonathan called out to the servant, "Hurry! Go faster! Don't delay!" Jonathan's servant retrieved the arrow and came back to his master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">(Now the servant did not understand any of this. Only Jonathan and David knew what was going on.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the servant who was with him. He said to him, "Go, take these things back to the city."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">When the servant had left, David got up from beside the mound, knelt with his face to the ground, and bowed three times. Then they kissed each other and they both wept, especially David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, for the two of us have sworn together in the name of the LORD saying, 'The LORD will be between me and you and between my descendants and your descendants forever.'"  Then David got up and left, while Jonathan went back to the city.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">David went to Ahimelech the priest in Nob. Ahimelech was shaking with fear when he met David, and said to him, "Why are you by yourself with no one accompanying you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">David replied to Ahimelech the priest, "The king instructed me to do something, but he said to me, 'Don't let anyone know the reason I am sending you or the instructions I have given you.' I have told my soldiers to wait at a certain place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now what do you have at your disposal? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The priest replied to David, "I don't have any ordinary bread at my disposal. Only holy bread is available, and then only if your soldiers have abstained from sexual relations with women."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David said to the priest, "Certainly women have been kept away from us, just as on previous occasions when I have set out. The soldiers' equipment is holy, even on an ordinary journey. How much more so will they be holy today, along with their equipment!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there other than the bread of the Presence. It had been removed from before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> in order to replace it with hot bread on the day it had been taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">(One of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. His name was Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul's shepherds.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David said to Ahimelech, "Is there no sword or spear here at your disposal? I don't have my own sword or equipment in hand due to the urgency of the king's instructions."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The priest replied, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the valley of Elah, is wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If you wish, take it for yourself. Other than that, there's nothing here." David said, "There's nothing like it! Give it to me!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So on that day David arose and fled from Saul. He went to King Achish of Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David, the king of the land? Isn't he the one that they sing about when they dance, saying,'Saul struck down his thousands, But David his tens of thousands'?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">David thought about what they said and was very afraid of King Achish of Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He altered his behavior in their presence. Since he was in their power, he pretended to be insane, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting his saliva run down his beard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Achish said to his servants, "Look at this madman! Why did you bring him to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Do I have a shortage of fools, that you have brought me this man to display his insanity in front of me? Should this man enter my house?"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So David left there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and the rest of his father's family learned about it, they went down there to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">All those who were in trouble or owed someone money or were discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. He had about four hundred men with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then David went from there to Mizpah in Moab, where he said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God is going to do for me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So he had them stay with the king of Moab; they stayed with him the whole time that David was in the stronghold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Gad the prophet said to David, "Don't stay in the stronghold. Go to the land of Judah." So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Saul found out the whereabouts of David and the men who were with him. Now Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree at an elevated location with his spear in hand and all his servants stationed around him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Saul said to his servants who were stationed around him, "Listen up, you Benjaminites! Is Jesse's son giving fields and vineyards to all of you? Or is he making all of you commanders and officers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For all of you have conspired against me! No one informs me when my own son makes an agreement with this son of Jesse! Not one of you feels sorry for me or informs me that my own son has commissioned my own servant to hide in ambush against me, as is the case today!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Doeg the Edomite, who had stationed himself with the servants of Saul, replied, "I saw this son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He inquired of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> for him and gave him provisions. He also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the king arranged for a meeting with the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and all the priests of his father's house who were at Nob. They all came to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Saul said, "Listen, son of Ahitub." He replied, "Here I am, my lord."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Saul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and this son of Jesse? You gave him bread and a sword and inquired of God on his behalf, so that he opposes me and waits in ambush, as is the case today!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Ahimelech replied to the king, "Who among all your servants is faithful like David? He is the king's son-in-law, the leader of your bodyguard, and honored in your house!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Was it just today that I began to inquire of God on his behalf? Far be it from me! The king should not accuse his servant or any of my father's house. For your servant is not aware of all this - not in whole or in part!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But the king said, "You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's house!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then the king said to the messengers who were stationed beside him, "Turn and kill the priests of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, for they too have sided with David! They knew he was fleeing, but they did not inform me." But the king's servants refused to harm the priests of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king said to Doeg, "You turn and strike down the priests!" So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests. He killed on that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">As for Nob, the city of the priests, he struck down with the sword men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep - all with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub escaped and fled to David. His name was Abiathar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then David said to Abiathar, "I knew that day when Doeg the Edomite was there that he would certainly tell Saul! I am guilty of all the deaths in your father's house!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Stay with me. Don't be afraid! Whoever seeks my life is seeking your life as well. You are secure with me."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">They told David, "The Philistines are fighting in Keilah and are looting the threshing floors."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So David asked the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "Should I go and strike down these Philistines?" The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to David, "Go, strike down the Philistines and deliver Keilah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But David's men said to him, "We are afraid while we are still here in Judah! What will it be like if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So David asked the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> once again. But again the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> replied, "Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will give the Philistines into your hand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines. He took away their cattle and thoroughly defeated them. David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when Abiathar son of Ahimelech had fled to David at Keilah, he had brought with him an ephod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When Saul was told that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, "God has delivered him into my hand, for he has boxed himself into a corner by entering a city with two barred gates."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Saul mustered all his army to go down to Keilah and besiege David and his men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When David realized that Saul was planning to harm him, he told Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then David said, "O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel, your servant has clearly heard that Saul is planning to come to Keilah to destroy the city because of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Will the leaders of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel, please inform your servant!"Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "He will come down."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">David asked, "Will the leaders of Keilah deliver me and my men into Saul's hand?" The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, "They will deliver you over."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So David and his men, who numbered about six hundred, set out and left Keilah; they moved around from one place to another. When told that David had escaped from Keilah, Saul called a halt to his expedition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">David stayed in the strongholds that were in the desert and in the hill country of the desert of Ziph. Saul looked for him all the time, but God did not deliver David into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">David realized that Saul had come out to seek his life; at that time David was in Horesh in the desert of Ziph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Jonathan son of Saul left and went to David at Horesh. He encouraged him through God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He said to him, "Don't be afraid! For the hand of my father Saul cannot find you. You will rule over Israel, and I will be your second in command. Even my father Saul realizes this."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When the two of them had made a covenant before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, David stayed on at Horesh, but Jonathan went to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Isn't David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now at your own discretion, O king, come down. Delivering him into the king's hand will be our responsibility."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Saul replied, "May you be blessed by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, for you have had compassion on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Go and make further arrangements. Determine precisely where he is and who has seen him there, for I am told that he is extremely cunning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Locate precisely all the places where he hides and return to me with dependable information. Then I will go with you. If he is in the land, I will find him among all the thousands of Judah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So they left and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the desert of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Saul and his men went to look for him. But David was informed and went down to the rock and stayed in the desert of Maon. When Saul heard about it, he pursued David in the desert of Maon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Saul went on one side of the mountain, while David and his men went on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, but Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men so they could capture them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But a messenger came to Saul saying, "Come quickly, for the Philistines have raided the land!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Saul stopped pursuing David and went to confront the Philistines. Therefore that place is called Sela Hammahlekoth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of En Gedi.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, they told him, "Look, David is in the desert of En Gedi."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So Saul took three thousand select men from all Israel and went to find David and his men in the region of the rocks of the mountain goats.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He came to the sheepfolds by the road, where there was a cave. Saul went into it to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the recesses of the cave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David's men said to him, "This is the day about which the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to you, 'I will give your enemy into your hand, and you can do to him whatever seems appropriate to you.'" So David got up and quietly cut off an edge of Saul's robe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Afterward David's conscience bothered him because he had cut off an edge of Saul's robe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He said to his men, "May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> keep me far away from doing such a thing to my lord, who is the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s chosen one, by extending my hand against him. After all, he is the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s chosen one."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">David restrained his men with these words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and started down the road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Afterward David got up and went out of the cave. He called out after Saul, "My lord, O king!" When Saul looked behind him, David kneeled down and bowed with his face to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">David said to Saul, "Why do you pay attention when men say, 'David is seeking to do you harm'?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Today your own eyes see how the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> delivered you - this very day - into my hands in the cave. Some told me to kill you, but I had pity on you and said, 'I will not extend my hand against my lord, for he is the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s chosen one.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Look, my father, and see the edge of your robe in my hand! When I cut off the edge of your robe, I didn't kill you. So realize and understand that I am not planning evil or rebellion. Even though I have not sinned against you, you are waiting in ambush to take my life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> judge between the two of us, and may the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> vindicate me over you, but my hand will not be against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">It's like the old proverb says: 'From evil people evil proceeds.' But my hand will not be against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Who has the king of Israel come out after? Who is it that you are pursuing? A dead dog? A single flea?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> be our judge and arbiter. May he see and arbitrate my case and deliver me from your hands!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When David finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, "Is that your voice, my son David?" Then Saul wept loudly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He said to David, "You are more innocent than I, for you have treated me well, even though I have tried to harm you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">You have explained today how you have treated me well. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> delivered me into your hand, but you did not kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now if a man finds his enemy, does he send him on his way in good shape? May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> repay you with good this day for what you have done to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now look, I realize that you will in fact be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So now swear to me in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s name that you will not kill my descendants after me or destroy my name from the house of my father."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">David promised Saul this on oath. Then Saul went to his house, and David and his men went up to the stronghold.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned him. They buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David left and went down to the desert of Paran.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. This man was very wealthy; he owned three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. At that time he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail. She was both wise and beautiful, but the man was harsh and his deeds were evil. He was a Calebite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When David heard in the desert that Nabal was shearing his sheep,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">he sent ten servants, saying to them, "Go up to Carmel to see Nabal and give him greetings in my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then you will say to my brother, "Peace to you and your house! Peace to all that is yours!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now I hear that they are shearing sheep for you. When your shepherds were with us, we neither insulted them nor harmed them the whole time they were in Carmel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Ask your own servants; they can tell you! May my servants find favor in your sight, for we have come at the time of a holiday. Please provide us - your servants and your son David - with whatever you can spare."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So David's servants went and spoke all these words to Nabal in David's name. Then they paused.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Nabal responded to David's servants, "Who is David, and who is this son of Jesse? This is a time when many servants are breaking away from their masters!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers and give them to these men? I don't even know where they came from!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So David's servants went on their way. When they had returned, they came and told David all these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then David instructed his men, "Each of you strap on your sword!" So each one strapped on his sword, and David also strapped on his sword. About four hundred men followed David up, while two hundred stayed behind with the equipment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But one of the servants told Nabal's wife Abigail, "David sent messengers from the desert to greet our lord, but he screamed at them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">These men were very good to us. They did not insult us, nor did we sustain any loss during the entire time we were together in the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Both night and day they were a protective wall for us the entire time we were with them, while we were tending our flocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now be aware of this, and see what you can do. For disaster has been planned for our lord and his entire household. He is such a wicked person that no one tells him anything!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So Abigail quickly took two hundred loaves of bread, two containers of wine, five prepared sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred bunches of raisins, and two hundred lumps of pressed figs. She loaded them on donkeys</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and said to her servants, "Go on ahead of me. I will come after you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Riding on her donkey, she went down under cover of the mountain. David and his men were coming down to meet her, and she encountered them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now David had been thinking, "In vain I guarded everything that belonged to this man in the desert. I didn't take anything from him. But he has repaid my good with evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">God will severely punish David, if I leave alive until morning even one male from all those who belong to him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When Abigail saw David, she got down quickly from the donkey, threw herself down before David, and bowed to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Falling at his feet, she said, "My lord, I accept all the guilt! But please let your female servant speak with my lord! Please listen to the words of your servant!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">My lord should not pay attention to this wicked man Nabal. He simply lives up to his name! His name means 'fool,' and he is indeed foolish! But I, your servant, did not see the servants my lord sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">"Now, my lord, as surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives and as surely as you live, it is the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who has kept you from shedding blood and taking matters into your own hands. Now may your enemies and those who seek to harm my lord be like Nabal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now let this present that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the servants who follow my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Please forgive the sin of your servant, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will certainly establish the house of my lord, because my lord fights the battles of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. May no evil be found in you all your days!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When someone sets out to chase you and to take your life, the life of my lord will be wrapped securely in the bag of the living by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God. But he will sling away the lives of your enemies from the sling's pocket!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will do for my lord everything that he promised you, and he will make you a leader over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Your conscience will not be overwhelmed with guilt for having poured out innocent blood and for having taken matters into your own hands. When the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has granted my lord success, please remember your servant."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then David said to Abigail, "Praised be the Lord, the God of Israel, who has sent you this day to meet me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Praised be your good judgment! May you yourself be rewarded for having prevented me this day from shedding blood and taking matters into my own hands!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Otherwise, as surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, the God of Israel, lives - he who has prevented me from harming you - if you had not come so quickly to meet me, by morning's light not even one male belonging to Nabal would have remained alive!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then David took from her hand what she had brought to him. He said to her, "Go back to your home in peace. Be assured that I have listened to you and responded favorably."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">When Abigail went back to Nabal, he was holding a banquet in his house like that of the king. Nabal was having a good time and was very intoxicated. She told him absolutely nothing until morning's light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">In the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him about these matters. He had a stroke and was paralyzed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">After about ten days the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> struck Nabal down and he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, "Praised be the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who has vindicated me and avenged the insult that I suffered from Nabal! The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has kept his servant from doing evil, and he has repaid Nabal for his evil deeds." Then David sent word to Abigail and asked her to become his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So the servants of David went to Abigail at Carmel and said to her, "David has sent us to you to bring you back to be his wife."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">She arose, bowed her face toward the ground, and said, "Your female servant, like a lowly servant, will wash the feet of the servants of my lord."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Then Abigail quickly went and mounted her donkey, with five of her female servants accompanying her. She followed David's messengers and became his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">David had also married Ahinoam from Jezreel; the two of them became his wives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">(Now Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.)</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Isn't David hiding on the hill of Hakilah near Jeshimon?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So Saul arose andwent down to the desert of Ziph, accompanied by three thousand select men of Israel, to look for David in the desert of Ziph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Saul camped by the road on the hill of Hakilah near Jeshimon, but David was staying in the desert. When he realized that Saul had come to the desert to find him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David sent scouts and verified that Saul had indeed arrived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So David set out and went to the place where Saul was camped. David saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general in command of his army, were sleeping. Now Saul was lying in the entrenchment, and the army was camped all around him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, "Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?" Abishai replied, "I will go down with you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So David and Abishai approached the army at night and found Saul lying asleep in the entrenchment with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. Abner and the army were lying all around him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Abishai said to David, "Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me drive the spear right through him into the ground with one swift jab! A second jab won't be necessary!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But David said to Abishai, "Don't kill him! Who can extend his hand against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s chosen one and remain guiltless?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">David went on to say, "As the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> himself will strike him down. Either his day will come and he will die, or he will go down into battle and be swept away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But may the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> prevent me from extending my hand against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s chosen one! Now take the spear by Saul's head and the jug of water, and let's get out of here!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So David took the spear and the jug of water by Saul's head, and they got out of there. No one saw them or was aware of their presence or woke up. All of them were asleep, for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had caused a deep sleep to fall on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then David crossed to the other side and stood on the top of the hill some distance away; there was a considerable distance between them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">David called to the army and to Abner son of Ner, "Won't you answer, Abner?" Abner replied, "Who are you, that you have called to the king?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">David said to Abner, "Aren't you a man? After all, who is like you in Israel? Why then haven't you protected your lord the king? One of the soldiers came to kill your lord the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This failure on your part isn't good! As surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives, you people who have not protected your lord, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s chosen one, are as good as dead! Now look where the king's spear and the jug of water that was by his head are!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When Saul recognized David's voice, he said, "Is that your voice, my son David?" David replied, "Yes, it's my voice, my lord the king."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He went on to say, "Why is my lord chasing his servant? What have I done? What wrong have I done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So let my lord the king now listen to the words of his servant. If the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has incited you against me, may he take delight in an offering. But if men have instigated this, may they be cursed before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>! For they have driven me away this day from being united with the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s inheritance, saying, 'Go on, serve other gods!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now don't let my blood fall to the ground away from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s presence, for the king of Israel has gone out to look for a flea the way one looks for a partridge in the hill country."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Saul replied, "I have sinned. Come back, my son David. I won't harm you, for you treated my life with value this day. I have behaved foolishly and have made a very terrible mistake!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">David replied, "Here is the king's spear! Let one of your servants cross over and get it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> rewards each man for his integrity and loyalty.

      <VERS vnumber="24">In the same way that I valued your life this day, may the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> value my life and deliver me from all danger."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Saul replied to David, "May you be rewarded, my son David! You will without question be successful!" So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">David thought to himself, "One of these days I'm going to be swept away by the hand of Saul! There is nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of searching for me through all the territory of Israel and I will escape from his hand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So David left and crossed over to King Achish son of Maoch of Gath accompanied by his six hundred men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">David settled with Achish in Gath, along with his men and their families. David had with him his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal's widow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When Saul learned that David had fled to Gath, he did not mount a new search for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David said to Achish, "If I have found favor with you, let me be given a place in one of the country towns so that I can live there. Why should your servant settle in the royal city with you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day. (For that reason Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until this very day.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The length of time that David lived in the Philistine countryside was a year and four months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. (They had been living in that land for a long time, from the approach to Shur as far as the land of Egypt.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When David would attack a district, he would leave neither man nor woman alive. He would take sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing and would then go back to Achish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Achish would ask, "Where did you raid today?" David would say, "The Negev of Judah" or "The Negev of Jeharmeel" or "The Negev of the Kenites."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Neither man nor woman would David leave alive so as to bring them back to Gath. He was thinking, "This way they can't tell on us, saying, 'This is what David did.'" Such was his practice the entire time that he lived in the country of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Achish trusted David, thinking to himself, "He is really hated among his own people in Israel! From now on he will be my servant."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days the Philistines gathered their troops for war in order to fight Israel. Achish said to David, "You should fully understand that you and your men must go with me into the battle."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">David replied to Achish, "That being the case, you will come to know what your servant can do!" Achish said to David, "Then I will make you my bodyguard from now on."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had lamented over him and had buried him in Ramah, his hometown. In the meantime Saul had removed the mediums and magicians  from the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The Philistines assembled; they came and camped at Shunem. Saul mustered all Israel and camped at Gilboa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was absolutely terrified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Saul inquired of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, but the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> did not answer him - not by dreams nor by Urim nor by the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Saul instructed his servants, "Find me a woman who is a medium, so that I may go to her and inquire of her." His servants replied to him, "There is a woman who is a medium in Endor."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothing and left, accompanied by two of his men. They came to the woman at night and said, "Use your ritual pit to conjure up for me the one I tell you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But the woman said to him, "Look, you are aware of what Saul has done; he has removed the mediums and magicians from the land! Why are you trapping me so you can put me to death?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Saul swore an oath to her by the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, "As surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives, you will not incur guilt in this matter!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The woman replied, "Who is it that I should bring up for you?" He said, "Bring up for me Samuel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out loudly. The woman said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The king said to her, "Don't be afraid! What have you seen?" The woman replied to Saul, "I have seen one like a god coming up from the ground!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said to her, "What about his appearance?" She said, "An old man is coming up! He is wrapped in a robe!"Then Saul realized it was Samuel, and he bowed his face toward the ground and kneeled down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" Saul replied, "I am terribly troubled! The Philistines are fighting against me and God has turned away from me. He does not answer me - not by the prophets nor by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what I should do."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Samuel said, "Why are you asking me, now that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has turned away from you and has become your enemy?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has done exactly as I prophesied! The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has torn the kingdom from your hand and has given it to your neighbor David!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Since you did not obey the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and did not carry out his fierce anger against the Amalekites, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has done this thing to you today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will hand you and Israel over to the Philistines! Tomorrow both you and your sons will be with me. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will also hand the army of Israel over to the Philistines!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Saul quickly fell full length on the ground and was very afraid because of Samuel's words. He was completely drained of energy, not having eaten anything all that day and night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When the woman came to Saul and saw how terrified he was, she said to him, "Your servant has done what you asked. I took my life into my own hands and did what you told me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now it's your turn to listen to your servant! Let me set before you a bit of bread so that you can eat. When you regain your strength, you can go on your way."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he refused, saying, "I won't eat!" Both his servants and the woman urged him to eat, so he gave in. He got up from the ground and sat down on the bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now the woman had a well-fed calf at her home that she quickly slaughtered. Taking some flour, she kneaded bread and baked it without leaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">She brought it to Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they arose and left that same night.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="29">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Philistines assembled all their troops at Aphek, while Israel camped at the spring that is in Jezreel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When the leaders of the Philistines were passing in review at the head of their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men were passing in review in the rear with Achish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The leaders of the Philistines asked, "What about these Hebrews?" Achish said to the leaders of the Philistines, "Isn't this David, the servant of King Saul of Israel, who has been with me for quite some time? I have found no fault with him from the day of his defection until the present time!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the leaders of the Philistines became angry with him and said to him, "Send the man back! Let him return to the place that you assigned him! Don't let him go down with us into the battle, for he might become our adversary in the battle. What better way to please his lord than with the heads of these men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Isn't this David, of whom they sang as they danced, 'Saul has struck down his thousands, but David his tens of thousands'?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Achish summoned David and said to him, "As surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives, you are an honest man, and I am glad to have you serving with me in the army. I have found no fault with you from the day that you first came to me until the present time. But in the opinion of the leaders, you are not reliable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So turn and leave in peace. You must not do anything that the leaders of the Philistines consider improper!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But David said to Achish, "What have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day that I first came into your presence until the present time, that I shouldn't go and fight the enemies of my lord the king?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Achish replied to David, "I am convinced that you are as reliable as the angel of God! However, the leaders of the Philistines have said, 'He must not go up with us in the battle.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So get up early in the morning along with the servants of your lord who have come with you. When you get up early in the morning, as soon as it is light enough to see, leave."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So David and his men got up early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines, but the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="30">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On the third day David and his men came to Ziklag. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They attacked Ziklag and burned it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They took captive the women who were in it, from the youngest to the oldest, but they did not kill anyone. They simply carried them off and went on their way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned. Their wives, sons, and daughters had been taken captive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then David and the men who were with him wept loudly until they could weep no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David's two wives had been taken captive - Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal's widow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">David was very upset, for the men were thinking of stoning him; each man grieved bitterly over his sons and daughters. But David drew strength from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then David said to the priest Abiathar son of Ahimelech, "Bring me the ephod." So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David inquired of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, saying, "Should I pursue this raiding band? Will I overtake them?" He said to him, "Pursue, for you will certainly overtake them and carry out a rescue!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So David went, accompanied by his six hundred men. When he came to the Wadi Besor, those who were in the rear stayed there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">David and four hundred men continued the pursuit, but two hundred men who were too exhausted to cross the Wadi Besor stayed there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David. They gave him bread to eat and water to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They gave him a slice of pressed figs and two bunches of raisins to eat. This greatly refreshed him, for he had not eaten food or drunk water for three days and three nights.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">David said to him, "To whom do you belong, and where are you from?" The young man said, "I am an Egyptian, the servant of an Amalekite man. My master abandoned me when I was ill for three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We conducted a raid on the Negev of the Kerethites, on the area of Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb. We burned Ziklag."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">David said to him, "Can you take us down to this raiding party?" He said, "Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to this raiding party."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So he took David down, and they found them spread out over the land. They were eating and drinking and enjoying themselves because of all the loot they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But David struck them down from twilight until the following evening. None of them escaped, with the exception of four hundred young men who got away on camels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">David retrieved everything the Amalekites had taken; he also rescued his two wives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">There was nothing missing, whether small or great. He retrieved sons and daughters, the plunder, and everything else they had taken. David brought everything back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">David took all the flocks and herds and drove them in front of the rest of the animals. People were saying, "This is David's plunder!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then David approached the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to go with him, those whom they had left at the Wadi Besor. They went out to meet David and the people who were with him. When David approached the people, he asked how they were doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But all the evil and worthless men among those who had gone with David said, "Since they didn't go with us, we won't give them any of the loot we retrieved! They may take only their wives and children. Let them lead them away and be gone!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But David said, "No! You shouldn't do this, my brothers. Look at what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has given us! He has protected us and has delivered into our hands the raiding party that came against us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Who will listen to you in this matter? The portion of the one who went down into the battle will be the same as the portion of the one who remained with the equipment! Let their portions be the same!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">From that time onward it was a binding ordinance for Israel, right up to the present time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah who were his friends, saying, "Here's a gift for you from the looting of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s enemies!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The gift was for those in the following locations: for those in Bethel, Ramoth Negev, and Jattir;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and Racal; for those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites and Kenites;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">for those in Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athach,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and Hebron; and for those in whatever other places David and his men had traveled.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="31">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel. The men of Israel fled from the Philistines and many of them fell dead on Mount Gilboa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Philistines stayed right on the heels of Saul and his sons. They struck down Saul's sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki-Shua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Saul himself was in the thick of the battle; the archers spotted him and wounded him severely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Saul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and stab me with it! Otherwise these uncircumcised people will come, stab me, and torture me." But his armor bearer refused to do it, because he was very afraid. So Saul took his sword and fell on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his own sword and died with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Saul, his three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men died together that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When the men of Israel who were in the valley and across the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled. The Philistines came and occupied them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The next day, when the Philistines came to strip loot from the corpses, they discovered Saul and his three sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They cut off Saul's head and stripped him of his armor. They sent messengers to announce the news in the temple of their idols and among their people throughout the surrounding land of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They placed Saul's armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and hung his corpse on the city wall of Beth Shan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When the residents of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">all their warriors set out and traveled throughout the night. They took Saul's corpse and the corpses of his sons from the city wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh, where they burned them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They took the bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh; then they fasted for seven days.</VERS>
