    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">to receive the instruction of wisdom, righteousness and judgment, and equity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He that is wise will hear, and will increase learning; and the intelligent will gain wise counsels:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">to understand a proverb and an allegory, the words of the wise and their enigmas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge: fools despise wisdom and instruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">for they shall be a garland of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">we shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">cast in thy lot among us; we will all have one purse:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">my son, walk not in the way with them, keep back thy foot from their path;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For in vain the net is spread in the sight of anything which hath wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And these lay wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So are the paths of every one that is greedy of gain: it taketh away the life of its possessors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wisdom crieth without; she raiseth her voice in the broadways;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">she calleth in the chief [place] of concourse, in the entry of the gates; in the city she uttereth her words:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">How long, simple ones, will ye love simpleness, and scorners take pleasure in their scorning, and the foolish hate knowledge?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour forth my spirit unto you, I will make known to you my words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one regarded;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and ye have rejected all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I also will laugh in your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">when your fear cometh as sudden destruction, and your calamity cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me early, and shall not find me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of Jehovah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">they would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way, and be filled with their own devices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of the foolish shall cause them to perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be at rest from fear of evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, if thou receivest my words, and layest up my commandments with thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom [and] thou apply thy heart to understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">yea, if thou criest after discernment [and] liftest up thy voice to understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hidden treasures:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, and find the knowledge of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For Jehovah giveth wisdom; out of his mouth [come] knowledge and understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; [he] is a shield to them that walk in integrity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">guarding the paths of just judgment and keeping the way of his godly ones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity: every good path.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When wisdom entereth into thy heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">discretion shall keep thee, understanding shall preserve thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the man that speaketh froward things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">[from those] who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">who rejoice to do evil, [and] delight in the frowardness of evil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">whose paths are crooked, and who are perverted in their course:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, from the stranger who flattereth with her words;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">none that go unto her return again, neither do they attain to the paths of life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">that thou mayest walk in the way of the good, and keep the paths of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">but the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful shall be plucked up out of it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, forget not my teaching, and let thy heart observe my commandments;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">for length of days, and years of life, and peace shall they add to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let not loving-kindness and truth forsake thee; bind them about thy neck, write them upon the tablet of thy heart:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and thou shalt find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Confide in Jehovah with all thy heart, and lean not unto thine own intelligence;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will make plain thy paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">it shall be health for thy navel, and moisture for thy bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Honour Jehovah with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy vats shall overflow with new wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My son, despise not the instruction of Jehovah, neither be weary of his chastisement;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">for whom Jehovah loveth he chasteneth, even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the gain thereof is better than the gain of silver, and her revenue than fine gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are not equal unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand riches and honour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is he that retaineth her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">By his knowledge the deeps were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">so shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace unto thy neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, and thy foot shall not stumble;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">when thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid, but thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the destruction of the wicked, when it cometh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for Jehovah shall be thy confidence, and he will keep thy foot from being taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give, when thou hast it by thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Envy not the man of violence, and choose none of his ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; but his secret is with the upright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; but he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He indeed scorneth the scorners; but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The wise shall inherit glory; but shame shall be the promotion of the foolish.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know intelligence;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">for I give you good doctrine: forsake ye not my law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he taught me, and said unto me, Let thy heart retain my words; keep my commandments and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Get wisdom, get intelligence: forget [it] not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee; love her, and she shall preserve thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The beginning of wisdom [is], Get wisdom; and with all thy getting get intelligence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Exalt her, and she shall promote thee; she shall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">She shall give to thy head a garland of grace; a crown of glory will she bestow upon thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, and the years of thy life shall be multiplied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I will teach thee in the way of wisdom, I will lead thee in paths of uprightness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Take fast hold of instruction, let [her] not go: keep her, for she is thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil [men]:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">avoid it, pass not by it; turn from it, and pass away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For they sleep not except they have done mischief, and their sleep is taken away unless they have caused [some] to fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the path of the righteous is as the shining light, going on and brightening until the day be fully come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Keep thy heart more than anything that is guarded; for out of it are the issues of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Put away from thee perverseness of mouth, and corrupt lips put far from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, attend unto my wisdom, incline thine ear to my understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that thou mayest keep reflection, and that thy lips may preserve knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the lips of the strange woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on Sheol.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah, and he pondereth all his paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He shall die for want of discipline; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, if thou hast become surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand for a stranger,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, since thou hast come into the hand of thy friend: go, humble thyself, and be urgent with thy friend.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">deliver thyself as a gazelle from the hand [of the hunter], and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">provideth her bread in the summer, [and] gathereth her food in the harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">How long, sluggard, wilt thou lie down? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So shall thy poverty come as a roving plunderer, and thy penury as an armed man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A man of Belial, a wicked person, is he that goeth about with a perverse mouth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">he winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">deceits are in his heart; he deviseth mischief at all times, he soweth discords.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly: in a moment shall he be broken, and without remedy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">These six [things] doth Jehovah hate, yea, seven are an abomination unto him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">a heart that deviseth wicked imaginations; feet that are swift in running to mischief;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">a false witness that uttereth lies, and he that soweth discords among brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My son, observe thy father's commandment, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">bind them continually upon thy heart, tie them about thy neck:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">when thou walkest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and [when] thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching a light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Lust not after her beauty in thy heart, neither let her take thee with her eyelids;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for by means of a whorish woman [a man is brought] to a loaf of bread, and another's wife doth hunt for the precious soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his garments not be burned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife: whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Whoso committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">A wound and contempt shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For jealousy is the rage of a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">he will not regard any ransom, neither will he rest content though thou multipliest [thy] gifts.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">that they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger who flattereth with her words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For at the window of my house, I looked forth through my lattice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the sons, a young man void of understanding,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And behold, there met him a woman in the attire of a harlot, and subtle of heart.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">now without, now in the broadways, and she lieth in wait at every corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And she caught him and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have peace-offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">therefore came I forth to meet thee, to seek earnestly thy face, and I have found thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I have decked my bed with tapestry coverlets of variegated linen from Egypt;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I have perfumed my couch with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Come, let us revel in love until the morning, let us delight ourselves with loves.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">he hath taken the money-bag with him, he will come home on the day of the full moon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">With her much enticement she beguiled him; with the smoothness of her lips she constrained him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He went after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, and as stocks [serve] for the correction of the fool;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">till an arrow strike through his liver: as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for its life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And now, ye sons, hearken unto me, and attend to the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let not thy heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for she hath cast down many wounded, and all slain by her were strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense to serve other gods which they knew not, they, [nor] ye, nor your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing which I hate!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are become a waste, a desolation, as at this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And now thus saith Jehovah the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Wherefore commit ye great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you no remnant;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">provoking me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are come to sojourn, that ye should be cut off, and that ye should be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They are not humbled unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes which I set before you and before your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to enter into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed: in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword [and] by the famine, from the least even unto the greatest; they shall die by the sword and by the famine, and they shall be an execration, an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and none of the remnant of Judah, that have come into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, so as to return into the land of Judah, whither they have a desire to return to dwell there; for none shall return but such as shall escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assemblage, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">[As for] the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of Jehovah, we will not hearken unto thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">but we will certainly do every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and we had plenty of bread, and were well, and saw no evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But since we left off burning incense to the queen of the heavens, and pouring out drink-offerings to her, we have wanted everything, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when we burned incense to the queen of the heavens and poured out drink-offerings to her, did we make for her cakes to portray her, and pour out drink-offerings to her, without our husbands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people that had given him that answer, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Is it not the incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes and the people of the land, that Jehovah remembered, and that came into his mind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Jehovah could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, [and] because of the abominations that ye had committed; and your land is become a waste, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as at this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not hearkened unto the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil hath come upon you, as at this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hands, saying, We will certainly perform our vows which we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her. Ye will certainly establish your vows, and entirely perform your vows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith Jehovah, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, [As] the Lord Jehovah liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, a very small company; and all the remnant of Judah, that have come into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine or theirs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And this shall be the sign unto you, saith Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall certainly stand against you for evil:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will give Pharaoh-Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">How doth the city sit solitary [that] was full of people! She that was great among the nations is become as a widow; the princess among the provinces is become tributary!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; among all her lovers she hath no comforter; all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude; she dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest: all her pursuers have overtaken her within the straits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly: all her gates are desolate; her priests sigh, her virgins are in grief; and as for her, she is in bitterness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her adversaries have become the head, her enemies prosper; for Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the adversary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And from the daughter of Zion all her splendour is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture; and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the days of her affliction and of her wanderings, since her people fell into the hand of an adversary, and none did help her, Jerusalem remembereth all her precious things which she had in the days of old: the adversaries have seen her, they mock at her ruin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore is she removed as an impurity: all that honoured her despise her because they have seen her nakedness; and she sigheth, and turneth backward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her impurity was in her skirts, she remembered not her latter end; and she came down wonderfully: she hath no comforter. Jehovah, behold my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her precious things; for she hath seen the nations enter into her sanctuary, concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their precious things for food to revive [their] soul. See, Jehovah, and consider, for I am become vile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, whom Jehovah hath afflicted in the day of his fierce anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them; he hath spread a net for my feet; he hath turned me back; he hath made me desolate [and] faint all the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fail; the Lord hath delivered me into hands out of which I am not able to rise up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Lord hath cast down all my mighty men in the midst of me; he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men; the Lord hath trodden as a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water: for the comforter that should revive my soul is far from me; my children are desolate, for the enemy hath prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort her; Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, [that] his adversaries [should be] round about him; Jerusalem is as an impurity among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment. Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow. My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I called for my lovers, they have deceived me; my priests and mine elders have expired in the city, while they sought them food to revive their soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">See, Jehovah, for I am in distress, my bowels are troubled; my heart is turned within me, for I have grievously rebelled: without, the sword hath bereaved [me], within, it is as death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They have heard that I sigh: I have no comforter: all mine enemies have heard of my calamity; they are glad that thou hast done it. Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">How hath the Lord in his anger covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud! He hath cast down from the heavens unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Lord hath swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob, and hath not spared; he hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah: he hath brought [them] down to the ground; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath withdrawn his right hand from before the enemy; and he burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, devouring round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He hath bent his bow like an enemy; he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and hath slain all that was pleasant to the eye: in the tent of the daughter of Zion, he hath poured out his fury like fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The Lord is become as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel; he hath swallowed up all her palaces; he hath destroyed his strongholds, and hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he hath violently cast down his enclosure as a garden; he hath destroyed his place of assembly: Jehovah hath caused set feast and sabbath to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger king and priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath rejected his sanctuary; he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces: they have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as on the day of a set feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out the line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying; and he hath made the rampart and the wall to lament: they languish together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her princes are among the nations: the law is no [more]; her prophets also find no vision from Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, they keep silence; they have cast dust upon their heads, they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their head to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Mine eyes are consumed with tears, my bowels are troubled; my liver is poured upon the earth, because of the ruin of the daughter of my people; because infant and suckling swoon in the streets of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city; when they pour out their soul into their mothers' bosom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">What shall I take to witness for thee? what shall I liken unto thee, daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, virgin daughter of Zion? For thy ruin is great as the sea: who will heal thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Thy prophets have seen vanity and folly for thee; and they have not revealed thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee burdens of falsehood and causes of expulsion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">All that pass by clap [their] hands at thee; they hiss and shake their head at the daughter of Jerusalem: Is this the city which they called, The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">All thine enemies open their mouth against thee, they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed [her] up; this is forsooth the day that we looked for: we have found, we have seen [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jehovah hath done what he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word which he had commanded from the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not spared, and he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Their heart cried unto the Lord. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a torrent day and night: give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Arise, cry out in the night, in the beginning of the watches; pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, who faint from hunger at the top of all the streets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">See, Jehovah, and consider to whom thou hast done this! Shall the women eat their fruit, the infants that they nursed? Shall priest and prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The child and the old man lie on the ground in the streets; my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: thou hast slain [them] in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, thou hast not spared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Thou hast called up, as on the day of a set feast, my terrors on every side; and in the day of Jehovah's anger there was none that escaped or remained: those that I have nursed and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And I looked, and behold, in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he spoke unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Come in between the wheels, under the cherub, and fill the hollow of thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub, [and came] over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah's glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim, then he went in, and stood beside the wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took and put it into the hands of him [that was] clothed with linen; who took [it], and went out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was as the look of a chrysolite stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel were in the midst of a wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it: they turned not as they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes round about, in them four [and] their wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, Galgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the cherubim mounted up. This was the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the glory of Jehovah departed from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight, when they went out; and the wheels were beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovah's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Each one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I had seen by the river Chebar their appearance and themselves: they went every one straight before them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Jehovah's house, which looketh eastward; and behold, at the door of the gate were five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and give wicked counsel in this city:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">who say, It is not the time to build houses: this is the cauldron, and we are the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the Spirit of Jehovah fell on me, and said unto me, Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; and the things that come into your mind, I know them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and it is the cauldron; but you will I bring forth out of the midst of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Ye have feared the sword, and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and give you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. And I fell down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Although I have removed them far off among the nations, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries whither they are come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye are scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my baggage by day, as a captive's baggage, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, [and] bore it upon [my] shoulder, in their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And in the morning the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, and a part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar, to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz the chief of his eunuchs, that he should bring of the children of Israel, both of the royal seed and of the nobles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">youths in whom was no blemish, and of goodly countenance, and skilful in all wisdom, and acquainted with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king appointed unto them a daily provision of the king's delicate food, and of the wine that he drank, to nourish them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the prince of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel he gave [the name] Belteshazzar, and to Hananiah, Shadrach, and to Mishael, Meshach, and to Azariah, Abed-nego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not pollute himself with the king's delicate food, nor with the wine which he drank; and he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not have to pollute himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And God granted Daniel favour and mercy before the prince of the eunuchs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king who hath appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces worse liking than the youths who are of your age? and ye would endanger my head with the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Daniel said to the steward, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king's delicate food: and as thou shalt see, deal with thy servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and were fatter in flesh than all the youths that ate of the king's delicate food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So the steward took away their delicate food, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the king spoke with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: and they stood before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And in all matters of judicious wisdom, as to which the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the scribes [and] magicians that were in all his realm.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the king commanded to call the scribes, and the magicians, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to shew the king his dreams; and they came and stood before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, O king, live for ever! tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The command is gone forth from me: If ye do not make known unto me the dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if ye shew the dream and its interpretation, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour; therefore shew me the dream and its interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would gain time, because ye see the word is gone forth from me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">but if ye do not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me its interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Chaldeans answered before the king and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter; therefore there is no king, however great and powerful, that hath asked such a thing of any scribe, or magician, or Chaldean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the thing that the king demandeth is extraordinary, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For this cause the king was irritated and very wroth, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the decree went forth that the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to slay them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Daniel answered with counsel and prudence to Arioch the chief of the king's bodyguard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">he answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so rigorous from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Daniel went in, and requested of the king that he would give him time, that he might shew the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that they would desire mercies of the God of the heavens concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; For wisdom and might are his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And it is he that changeth times and seasons; He deposeth kings, and setteth up kings; He giveth wisdom to the wise, And knowledge to them that know understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">It is he that revealeth the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I thank thee, and I praise thee, O God of my fathers, Who hast given me wisdom and might, And hast made known unto me already what we desired of thee; For thou hast made known unto us the king's matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him: I have found a man of the sons of the captivity of Judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king answered and said unto Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream that I have seen, and its interpretation?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said, The secret that the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the magicians, the scribes, the astrologers, shew unto the king;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">but there is a God in the heavens, who revealeth secrets, and maketh known to king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be at the end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">as for thee, O king, thy thoughts arose upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And as for me, this secret is revealed to me, not by [any] wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation should be made known to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Thou, O king, sawest, and behold, a great image. This image was mighty and its brightness excellent; it stood before thee, and its appearance was terrible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This image's head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands; and it smote the image upon its feet of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken in pieces together, and they became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them. And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Thou, O king, art a king of kings, unto whom the God of the heavens hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and wheresoever the children of men, the beasts of the field, and the fowl of the heavens dwell, he hath given them into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all: thou art this head of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; then another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth everything, and as iron that breaketh all these, so shall it break in pieces and bruise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And [as] the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay, the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And in the days of these kings shall the God of the heavens set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the sovereignty thereof shall not be left to another people: it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, but itself shall stand for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. And the dream is certain, and the interpretation of it sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The king answered Daniel and said, Of a truth it is that your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, because thou wast able to reveal this secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon. And Daniel was in the gate of the king.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">and [that] whosoever doth not fall down and worship, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: these men, O king, regard thee not; they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image that thou hast set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then were these men brought before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them, Is it of purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image that I have set up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now if ye be ready at the time that ye hear the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, [well]: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast that same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace: and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If it be [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver [us] out of thy hand, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image that thou hast set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. He spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their cloaks, and their garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Forasmuch as the king's commandment was rigorous, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that had taken up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste; he spoke and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the opening of the burning fiery furnace; he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come [hither]. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth from the midst of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had had no power, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and who changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore I make a decree, that in every people, nation, and language, he who shall speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and his house shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that is able to deliver after this sort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then came in the scribes, the magicians, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and before him I told the dream:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">O Belteshazzar, master of the scribes, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret is too hard for thee, tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen, and the interpretation of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached unto the heavens, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Its leaves were beautiful, and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the heavens;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">he cried aloud, and said thus: Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the beasts get away from under it, and the birds from its branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be bathed with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the decision by the word of the holy ones: that the living may know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, nor its interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and its interpretation to thine enemies!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The tree that thou sawest, which grew and was strong, whose height reached unto the heavens, and the sight of it to all the earth;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the heavens, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be bathed with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which cometh upon my lord the king:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">At the end of twelve months he was walking upon the royal palace of Babylon:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from the heavens: King Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">The same hour was the word fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen; and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, till his hair grew like eagles' [feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto the heavens, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the army of the heavens, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his nobles, and drank wine before the thousand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream; he told the sum of the matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of the heavens broke forth upon the great sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till its wings were plucked; and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And behold, another beast, a second, like unto a bear, and it raised up itself on one side; and [it had] three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and they said thus unto it: Arise, devour much flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird upon its back; and the beast had four heads; and dominion was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceeding strong; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another, a little horn, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I beheld till thrones were set, and the Ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was flames of fire, [and] its wheels burning fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I beheld therefore, because of the voice of the great words that the horn spoke; I beheld till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given up to be burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of heaven [one] like a son of man, and he came up even to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As for me Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the certainty of all this. And he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, [that] shall arise out of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the saints of the most high [places] shall receive the kingdom, and they shall possess the kingdom for ever, even to the ages of ages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then I desired to know the certainty concerning the fourth beast, which was different from them all, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Jehovah that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The beginning of the word of Jehovah through Hosea. And Jehovah said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms; for the land is entirely given up to whoredom, away from Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived and bore him a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jehovah said unto him, Call his name Jizreel; for yet a little, and I will visit the blood of Jizreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jizreel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And he said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, so that I should pardon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by Jehovah their God; and I will not save them by bow, or by sword, or by battle, [or] by horses, or by horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And she weaned Lo-ruhamah; and she conceived and bore a son;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and he said, Call his name Lo-ammi; for ye are not my people, and I will not be for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured or numbered; and it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said unto them, Sons of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up out of the land: for great is the day of Jizreel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Say unto your brethren Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her as a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they are the children of whoredoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For their mother hath played the harlot; she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give [me] my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns; and I will fence [her] in with a wall, that she shall not find her paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And she shall pursue after her lovers, and shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, and shall not find them: and she shall say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then was it better with me than now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And she did not know that I had given her the corn and the new wine and the oil, and had multiplied to her the silver and gold, which they employed for Baal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my new wine in its season, and will withdraw my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And now will I discover her impiety in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I will cause all her mirth to cease: her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths! and all her solemnities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I will make desolate her vine and her fig-tree, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards which my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I will visit upon her the days of the Baals, wherein she burned incense to them, and decked herself with her rings and jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it shall be in that day, saith Jehovah, [that] thou shalt call me, My husband, and shalt call me no more, Baali;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I will make a covenant for them in that day with the beasts of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground; and I will break bow and sword and battle out of the land; and I will make them to lie down safely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; and I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith Jehovah, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and the earth shall hear the corn, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jizreel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And I will sow her unto me in the land; and I will have mercy upon Lo-ruhamah; and I will say to Lo-ammi, Thou art my people; and they shall say, My God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehovah said unto me, Go again, love a woman beloved of a friend, and an adulteress, according to the love of Jehovah for the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love raisin-cakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So I bought her to me for fifteen silver [pieces], and for a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be [another] man's, and I will also be for thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without statue, and without ephod and teraphim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Afterwards shall the children of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their God, and David their king; and shall turn with fear toward Jehovah and toward his goodness, at the end of the days.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hear the word of Jehovah, ye children of Israel; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land; for there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out; and blood toucheth blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens, yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yet let no man strive, and let no man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And thou shalt stumble by day; and the prophet also shall stumble with thee by night: and I will destroy thy mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; for thou hast rejected knowledge, and I will reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me; seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They eat the sin of my people, and their soul longeth for their iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it shall be as the people so the priest; and I will visit their ways upon them, and recompense to them their doings;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: for they have left off taking heed to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Fornication, and wine, and new wine take away the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">My people ask counsel of their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of whoredoms causeth [them] to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oak and poplar and terebinth, because the shade thereof is good; therefore your daughters play the harlot and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your daughters-in-law for their committing adultery; for they themselves go aside with harlots, and they sacrifice with prostitutes: and the people that doth not understand shall come to ruin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, let not Judah trespass; and come ye not unto Gilgal, neither go up to Beth-aven, nor swear [As] Jehovah liveth!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For Israel is refractory as an untractable heifer; now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a wide [pasture].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Ephraim is joined to idols: leave him alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Their drink is sour; they give themselves up to whoredom; her great men passionately love [their] shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hear this, ye priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ear, O house of the king: for this judgment is for you; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they have plunged themselves in the corruption of apostasy, but I will be a chastiser of them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, Ephraim, thou hast committed whoredom; Israel is defiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Their doings do not allow them to return unto their God; for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they know not Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Israel's pride doth testify to his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall fall by their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find [him]: he hath withdrawn himself from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have begotten strange children: now shall the new moon devour them, with their allotted possessions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Blow the horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah; cry aloud [at] Beth-aven: behind thee, O Benjamin!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Ephraim shall be a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which is sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The princes of Judah are become like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, because in selfwill he walked after the commandment [of man].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I will be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his sore, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb; but he was unable to heal you, nor hath he removed your sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah. I, I will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I will go away, I will return to my place, till they acknowledge their trespass, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Come and let us return unto Jehovah: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">and we shall know, we shall follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is assured as the morning dawn; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain which watereth the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">What shall I do unto thee, Ephraim? What shall I do unto thee, Judah? For your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that early passeth away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore have I hewed [them] by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and my judgment goeth forth as the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For I delight in loving-kindness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is tracked with blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And as troops of robbers lie in wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way of Shechem; yea, they commit lewdness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In the house of Israel have I seen a horrible thing: the whoredom of Ephraim is there; Israel is defiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Also, for thee, Judah, is a harvest appointed, when I shall turn again the captivity of my people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When I would heal Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim is discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they practise falsehood; and the thief entereth in, [and] the troop of robbers assaileth without.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they say not in their hearts [that] I remember all their wickedness: now do their own doings encompass them; they are before my face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They all practise adultery, as an oven heated by the baker: he ceaseth from stirring [the fire] after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine: he stretched out his hand to scorners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For they have applied their heart like an oven to their lying in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth like a flaming fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Ephraim, he mixeth himself with the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth [it] not; yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth [it] not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face; and they do not return to Jehovah their God, nor seek him for all this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Ephraim is become like a silly dove without understanding: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When they go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowl of the heavens; I will chastise them, according as their assembly hath heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have transgressed against me. And I would redeem them; but they speak lies against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they cried not unto me in their heart, when they howled upon their beds; they assemble themselves for corn and new wine; they have turned aside from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I have indeed trained, I have strengthened their arms, but they imagine mischief against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They return, [but] not to the [Most] High: they are like a deceitful bow. Their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Set the trumpet to thy mouth. [He cometh] as an eagle against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed my covenant, and rebelled against my law.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Israel hath cast off good: the enemy shall pursue him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not; of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast [thee] off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will they be incapable of purity?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For from Israel is this also: a workman made it, and it is no God: for the calf of Samaria shall be [broken in] pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk; should it sprout, it would yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Israel is swallowed up: now are they become among the nations as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they are gone up [to] Assyria [as] a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Although they hire among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall begin to be straitened under the burden of the king of princes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I have prescribed unto him the manifold things of my law: they are counted [as] a strange thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They sacrifice flesh [for] the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; Jehovah hath no delight in them. Now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Rejoice not, Israel, exultingly, as the peoples; for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved harlot's hire upon every corn-floor.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">They shall not dwell in Jehovah's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and in Assyria shall they eat that which is unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They shall pour out no [offerings of] wine to Jehovah, neither shall their sacrifices be pleasing unto him: they shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be defiled: for their bread shall be for themselves; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">What will ye do in the day of assembly, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But Herod the king having heard [of it], was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and, assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea; for thus it is written through the prophet:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And *thou* Bethlehem, land of Juda, art in no wise the least among the governors of Juda; for out of thee shall go forth a leader who shall shepherd my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod, having secretly called the magi, inquired of them accurately the time of the star that was appearing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and having sent them to Bethlehem, said, Go, search out accurately concerning the child, and when ye shall have found [him] bring me back word, so that *I* also may come and do him homage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they having heard the king went their way; and lo, the star, which they had seen in the east, went before them until it came and stood over the place where the little child was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And having come into the house they saw the little child with Mary his mother, and falling down did him homage. And having opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And being divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now, they having departed, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise, take to [thee] the little child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I shall tell thee; for Herod will seek the little child to destroy it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And, having arisen, he took to [him] the little child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he was there until the death of Herod, that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [the] Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Herod, seeing that he had been mocked by the magi, was greatly enraged; and sent and slew all the boys which [were] in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time which he had accurately inquired from the magi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">A voice has been heard in Rama, weeping, and great lamentation: Rachel weeping [for] her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Herod having died, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Arise, take to [thee] the little child and its mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they who sought the life of the little child are dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he arose and took to [him] the little child and its mother, and came into the land of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">but having heard that 'Archelaus reigns over Judaea, instead of Herod his father,' he was afraid to go there; and having been divinely instructed in a dream, he went away into the parts of Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and came and dwelt in a town called Nazareth; so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, He shall be called a Nazaraean.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And that [same] day Jesus went out from the house and sat down by the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And great crowds were gathered together to him, so that going on board ship himself he sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and as he sowed, some [grains] fell along the way, and the birds came and devoured them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and others fell upon the rocky places where they had not much earth, and immediately they sprang up out of [the ground] because of not having [any] depth of earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but when the sun rose they were burned up, and because of not having [any] root were dried up;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and others fell upon the good ground, and produced fruit, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He that has ears, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the disciples came up and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he answering said to them, Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not given;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">for whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall be caused to be in abundance; but he who has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For this cause I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor understand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and in them is filled up the prophecy of Esaias, which says, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and beholding ye shall behold and not see;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">for the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes as asleep, lest they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But blessed are *your* eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous [men] have desired to see the things which ye behold and did not see [them], and to hear the things which ye hear and did not hear [them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">*Ye*, therefore, hear the parable of the sower.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">From every one who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand [it], the wicked one comes and catches away what was sown in his heart: this is he that is sown by the wayside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But he that is sown on the rocky places this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but has no root in himself, but is for a time only; and when tribulation or persecution happens on account of the word, he is immediately offended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he that is sown among the thorns this is he who hears the word, and the anxious care of this life, and the deceit of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he that is sown upon the good ground this is he who hears and understands the word, who bears fruit also, and produces, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel amongst the wheat, and went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But when the blade shot up and produced fruit, then appeared the darnel also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the bondmen of the householder came up and said to him, Sir, hast thou not sown good seed in thy field? whence then has it darnel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he said to them, A man [that is] an enemy has done this. And the bondmen said to him, Wilt thou then that we should go and gather it [up]?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he said, No; lest [in] gathering the darnel ye should root up the wheat with it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Suffer both to grow together unto the harvest, and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvestmen, Gather first the darnel, and bind it into bundles to burn it; but the wheat bring together into my granary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard [seed] which a man took and sowed in his field;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">which is less indeed than all seeds, but when it is grown is greater than herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it had been all leavened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from [the] world's foundation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he answering said, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil [one];</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil; and the harvest is [the] completion of [the] age, and the harvestmen are angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">As then the darnel is gathered and is burned in the fire, thus it shall be in the completion of the age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all offences, and those that practise lawlessness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and they shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field, which a man having found has hid, and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">and having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a seine which has been cast into the sea, and which has gathered together of every kind,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">which, when it has been filled, having drawn up on the shore and sat down, they gathered the good into vessels and cast the worthless out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Thus shall it be in the completion of the age: the angels shall go forth and sever the wicked from the midst of the just,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yea, [Lord].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And he said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man [that is] a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables he withdrew thence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And having come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence has this [man] this wisdom and these works of power?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then has this [man] all these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And they were offended in him. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, unless in his country and in his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And he did not there many works of power, because of their unbelief.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For Herod had seized John, and had bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And [while] desiring to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they held him for a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Herod's birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And Jesus, having heard it, went away thence by ship to a desert place apart. And the crowds having heard [of it] followed him on foot from the cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And going out he saw a great crowd, and was moved with compassion about them, and healed their infirm.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go: give *ye* them to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But they say to him, We have not here save five loaves and two fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said, Bring them here to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And having commanded the crowds to recline upon the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed: and having broken the loaves, he gave [them] to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">But in the fourth watch of the night he went off to them, walking on the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the disciples, seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition. And they cried out through fear.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">And having taken [the] cup and given thanks, he gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For this is my blood, that of the [new] covenant, that shed for many for remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But I say to you, that I will not at all drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then saith Jesus to them, All *ye* shall be offended in me during this night. For it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But after that I shall be risen, I will go before you to Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Peter answering said to him, If all shall be offended in thee, *I* will never be offended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, that during this night, before [the] cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter says to him, If I should needs die with thee, I will in no wise deny thee. Likewise said all the disciples also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and says to the disciples, Sit here until I go away and pray yonder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And taking with [him] Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then he says to them, My soul is very sorrowful even unto death; remain here and watch with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And going forward a little he fell upon his face, praying and saying, My Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me; but not as *I* will, but as *thou* [wilt].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Thus ye have not been able to watch one hour with me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] ready, but the flesh weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Again going away a second time he prayed saying, My Father, if this cannot pass [from me] unless I drink it, thy will be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And coming he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And leaving them, he went away again and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he comes to the disciples and says to them, Sleep on now and take your rest; behold, the hour has drawn nigh, and the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up has drawn nigh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and elders of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is: seize him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And immediately coming up to Jesus he said, Hail, Rabbi, and covered him with kisses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But Jesus said to him, [My] friend, for what purpose art thou come? Then coming up they laid hands upon Jesus and seized him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and smiting the bondman of the high priest took off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then saith Jesus to him, Return thy sword to its place; for all who take the sword shall perish by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Or thinkest thou that I cannot now call upon my Father, and he will furnish me more than twelve legions of angels?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks to take me? I sat daily [with you] teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But all this is come to pass that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Now they that had seized Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And Peter followed him at a distance, even to the palace of the high priest, and entering in sat with the officers to see the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And the chief priests and the elders and the whole sanhedrim sought false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. But at the last two false witnesses came forward</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">and said, *He* said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and in three days build it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And the high priest standing up said to him, Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus was silent. And the high priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us if *thou* art the Christ the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Jesus says to him, *Thou* hast said. Moreover, I say to you, From henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has blasphemed: what need have we any more of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">What think ye? And they answering said, He is liable to the penalty of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him, and some struck him with the palms of their hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">saying, Prophesy to us, Christ, Who is it who struck thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">But Peter sat without in the palace-court; and a maid came to him, saying, And *thou* wast with Jesus the Galilaean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But he denied before all, saying, I do not know what thou sayest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And when he had gone out into the entrance, another [maid] saw him, and says to those there, This [man] also was with Jesus the Nazaraean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">And again he denied with an oath: I do not know the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">And after a little, those who stood [there], coming to [him], said to Peter, Truly *thou* too art of them, for also thy speech makes thee manifest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately [the] cock crew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said [to him], Before [the] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went forth without, and wept bitterly.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when it was morning all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus so that they might put him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And having bound him they led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Judas, who delivered him up, seeing that he had been condemned, filled with remorse, returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">saying, I have sinned [in] having delivered up guiltless blood. But they said, What is that to us? see *thou* [to that].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And having cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, he left the place, and went away and hanged himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, It is not lawful to cast them into the Corban, since it is [the] price of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And having taken counsel, they bought with them the field of the potter for a burying-ground for strangers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore that field has been called Blood-field unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet, saying, And I took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was set a price on, whom [they who were] of the sons of Israel had set a price on,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he was accused of the chief priests and the elders, he answered nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then says Pilate to him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he answered him not so much as one word, so that the governor wondered exceedingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now at [the] feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd, whom they would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they had then a notable prisoner, named Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he knew that they had delivered him up through envy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But, as he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous [man]; for I have suffered to-day many things in a dream because of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should beg for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the governor answering said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate says to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the governor said, What evil then has he done? But they cried more than ever, saying, Let him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Pilate, seeing that it availed nothing, but that rather a tumult was arising, having taken water, washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am guiltless of the blood of this righteous one: see *ye* [to it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all the people answering said, His blood [be] on us and on our children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he released to them Barabbas; but Jesus, having scourged [him], he delivered up that he might be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus with [them] to the praetorium, gathered against him the whole band,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and having taken off his garment, put on him a scarlet cloak;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and having woven a crown out of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and, bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And having spit upon him, they took the reed and beat [him] on his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had mocked him, they took the cloak off him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And as they went forth they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; him they compelled to go [with them] that he might bear his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And having come to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a skull,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">they gave to him to drink vinegar mingled with gall; and having tasted [it], he would not drink.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">And sitting down, they kept guard over him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they set up over his head his accusation written: This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then are crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But the passers-by reviled him, shaking their heads</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou art Son of God, descend from the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">[And] in like manner the chief priests also, mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusted upon God; let him save him now if he will [have] him. For he said, I am Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the robbers also who had been crucified with him cast the same reproaches on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now from [the] sixth hour there was darkness over the whole land until [the] ninth hour;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">but about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And some of those who stood there, when they heard [it], said, This [man] calls for Elias.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="49">But the rest said, Let be; let us see if Elias comes to save him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus, having again cried with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And lo, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were rent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="62">Now on the morrow, which is after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="64">Command therefore that the sepulchre be secured until the third day, lest his disciples should come and steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Why does this [man] thus speak? he blasphemes. Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And straightway Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they are reasoning thus within themselves, said to them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, [Thy] sins are forgiven [thee]; or to say, Arise, and take up thy couch and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, he says to the paralytic,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch and go to thine house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass that he went on the sabbath through the cornfields; and his disciples began to walk on, plucking the ears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath what is not lawful?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And *he* said to them, Have ye never read what David did when he had need and hungered, *he* and those with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">how he entered into the house of God, in [the section of] Abiathar [the] high priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful unless for the priests to eat, and gave even to those that were with him?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">But seeing Jesus from afar off, he ran and did him homage,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and crying with a loud voice he says, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For he said to him, Come forth, unclean spirit, out of the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he asked him, What is thy name? And he says to him, Legion is my name, because we are many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now there was there just at the mountain a great herd of swine feeding;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Forasmuch as many have undertaken to draw up a relation concerning the matters fully believed among us,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">it has seemed good to *me* also, accurately acquainted from the origin with all things, to write to thee with method, most excellent Theophilus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">that thou mightest know the certainty of those things in which thou hast been instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Abia, and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, as he fulfilled his priestly service before God in the order of his course,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">it fell to him by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And all the multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And an angel of [the] Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the altar of incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Zacharias was troubled, seeing [him], and fear fell upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias, because thy supplication has been heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he shall be to thee joy and rejoicing, and many shall rejoice at his birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he shall be great before [the] Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with [the] Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to [the] Lord their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And *he* shall go before him in [the] spirit and power of Elias, to turn hearts of fathers to children, and disobedient ones to [the] thoughts of just [men], to make ready for [the] Lord a prepared people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this, for *I* am an old man, and my wife advanced in years?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the angel answering, said to him, *I* am Gabriel, who stand before God, and I have been sent to speak to thee, and to bring these glad tidings to thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, till the day in which these things shall take place, because thou hast not believed my words, the which shall be fulfilled in their time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the people were awaiting Zacharias, and they wondered at his delaying in the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when he came out he could not speak to them, and they recognised that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he was making signs to them, and continued dumb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass, when the days of his service were completed, he departed to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now after these days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thus has [the] Lord done to me in [these] days in which he looked upon [me] to take away my reproach among men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent of God to a city of Galilee, of which [the] name [was] Nazareth,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">But she, [seeing] [the angel], was troubled at his word, and reasoned in her mind what this salutation might be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and behold, thou shalt conceive in the womb and bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">*He* shall be great, and shall be called Son of [the] Highest; and [the] Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">But Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I know not a man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the angel answering said to her, [The] Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and power of [the] Highest overshadow thee, wherefore the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And behold, Elizabeth, thy kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her that was called barren:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">And it came to pass, as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with [the] Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and cried out with a loud voice and said, Blessed [art] *thou* amongst women, and blessed the fruit of thy womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And whence [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For behold, as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped with joy in my womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And blessed [is] she that has believed, for there shall be a fulfilment of the things spoken to her from [the] Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">For he has looked upon the low estate of his bondmaid; for behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">For the Mighty One has done to me great things, and holy [is] his name;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and his mercy [is] to generations and generations to them that fear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He has wrought strength with his arm; he has scattered haughty [ones] in the thought of their heart.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass afterwards that *he* went through [the country] city by city, and village by village, preaching and announcing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; and the twelve [were] with him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And a great crowd coming together, and those who were coming to him out of each city, he spoke by parable:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell along the way, and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it up;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and other fell upon the rock, and having sprung up, it was dried up because it had not moisture;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and other fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns having sprung up with [it] choked it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and other fell into the good ground, and having sprung up bore fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And his disciples asked him [saying], What may this parable be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, in order that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But those by the wayside are those who hear; then comes the devil and takes away the word from their heart that they may not believe and be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But those upon the rock, those who when they hear receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a time, and in time of trial fall away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But that that fell where the thorns were, these are they who having heard go away and are choked under cares and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But that in the good ground, these are they who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And no one having lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a couch, but sets it on a lamp-stand, that they who enter in may see the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For there is nothing hid which shall not become manifest, nor secret which shall not be known and come to light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Take heed therefore how ye hear; for whosoever has, to him shall be given, and whosoever has not, even what he seems to have shall be taken from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And his mother and his brethren came to him, and could not get to him because of the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it was told him [saying], Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, wishing to see thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And it came to pass on one of the days, that *he* entered into a ship, himself and his disciples; and he said to them, Let us pass over to the other side of the lake; and they set off from shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as they sailed, he fell asleep; and a sudden squall of wind came down on the lake, and they were filled [with water], and were in danger;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and coming to [him] they woke him up, saying, Master, master, we perish. But he, rising up, rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said to them, Where is your faith? And, being afraid, they were astonished, saying to one another, Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they arrived in the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as he got out [of the ship] on the land, a certain man out of the city met him, who had demons a long time, and put on no clothes, and did not abide in a house, but in the tombs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But seeing Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee torment me not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For he had commanded the unclean spirit to go out from the man. For very often it had seized him; and he had been bound, kept with chains and fetters; and breaking the bonds he was driven by the demon into the deserts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Jesus asked him saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: for many demons had entered into him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they besought him that he would not command them to go away into the bottomless pit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain, and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into those; and he suffered them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the demons, going out from the man, entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the precipice into the lake, and were choked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But they that fed [them], seeing what had happened, fled, and told [it] to the city and to the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting, clothed and sensible, at the feet of Jesus. And they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And they also who had seen it told them how the possessed man had been healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And all the multitude of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were possessed with great fear; and *he*, entering into the ship, returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But the man out of whom the demons had gone besought him that he might be with him. But he sent him away, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Return to thine house and relate how great things God has done for thee. And he went away through the whole city, publishing how great things Jesus had done for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And it came to pass when Jesus returned, the crowd received him gladly, for they were all expecting him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And behold, a man came, whose name was Jairus, and he was [a] ruler of the synagogue, and falling at the feet of Jesus besought him to come to his house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. And as he went the crowds thronged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And a woman who had a flux of blood since twelve years, who, having spent all her living on physicians, could not be cured by any one,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">coming up behind, touched the hem of his garment, and immediately her flux of blood stopped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And Jesus said, Who has touched me? But all denying, Peter and those with him said, Master, the crowds close thee in and press upon thee, and sayest thou, Who has touched me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Jesus said, Some one has touched me, for *I* have known that power has gone out from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And the woman, seeing that she was not hid, came trembling, and falling down before him declared before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was immediately healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he said to her, [Be of good courage,] daughter; thy faith has healed thee; go in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">While he was yet speaking, comes some one from the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; do not trouble the teacher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But Jesus, hearing it, answered him saying, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And when he came to the house he suffered no one to go in but Peter and John and James and the father of the child and the mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And all were weeping and lamenting her. But he said, Do not weep, for she has not died, but sleeps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And they derided him, knowing that she had died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But *he*, having turned them all out and taking hold of her hand, cried saying, Child, arise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And her spirit returned, and immediately she rose up; and he commanded [something] to eat to be given to her.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things which were done [by him], and was in perplexity, because it was said by some that John was risen from among [the] dead,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">But the day began to decline, and the twelve came and said to him, Send away the crowd that they may go into the villages around, and [into] the fields, and lodge and find victuals, for here we are in a desert place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he said to them, Give *ye them to eat. And they said, We have not more than five loaves and two fishes, unless *we* should go and buy food for all this people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">for they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down in companies by fifties.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they did so, and made them all sit down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven he blessed them, and broke and gave to the disciples to set before the crowd.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">But they answering said, John the baptist; but others, Elias; and others, that one of the old prophets has risen again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said to them, But *ye*, who do ye say that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But, earnestly charging them, he enjoined [them] to say this to no man,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said to [them] all, If any one will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">for whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, *he* shall save it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And it came to pass after these words, about eight days, that taking Peter and John and James he went up into a mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And as he prayed the fashion of his countenance became different and his raiment white [and] effulgent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And lo, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elias,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">who, appearing in glory, spoke of his departure which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">And as the voice was [heard] Jesus was found alone: and *they* kept silence, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And it came to pass on the following day, when they came down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And lo, a man from the crowd cried out saying, Teacher, I beseech thee look upon my son, for he is mine only child:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it tears him with foaming, and with difficulty departs from him after crushing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And I besought thy disciples that they might cast him out, and they could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring hither thy son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But as he was yet coming, the demon tore him and dragged him all together. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child and gave him back to his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And all were astonished at the glorious greatness of God. And as all wondered at all the things which [Jesus] did, he said to his disciples,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">The Pharisee, standing, prayed thus to himself: God, I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I fast twice in the week, I tithe everything I gain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the tax-gatherer, standing afar off, would not lift up even his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, O God, have compassion on me, the sinner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I say unto you, This [man] went down to his house justified rather than that [other]. For every one who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they brought to him also infants that he might touch them, but the disciples when they saw [it] rebuked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Jesus calling them to [him] said, Suffer little children to come to me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And a certain ruler asked him saying, Good teacher, having done what, shall I inherit eternal life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said, All these things have I kept from my youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when Jesus had heard this, he said to him, One thing is lacking to thee yet: Sell all that thou hast and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in the heavens, and come, follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But when he heard this he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, he said, How difficultly shall those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">for it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And those who heard it said, And who can be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But he said, The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Peter said, Behold, *we* have left all things and have followed thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he said to them, Verily I say to you, There is no one who has left home, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">who shall not receive manifold more at this time, and in the coming age life eternal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he took the twelve to [him] and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written of the Son of man by the prophets shall be accomplished;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they have scourged [him] they will kill him; and on the third day he will rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they understood nothing of these things. And this word was hidden from them, and they did not know what was said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And it came to pass when he came into the neighbourhood of Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And when he heard the crowd passing, he inquired what this might be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they told him that Jesus the Nazaraean was passing by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he called out saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And those [who were] going before rebuked him that he might be silent; but *he* cried out so much the more, Son of David, have mercy on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be led to him. And when he drew nigh he asked him [saying],</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I may see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Jesus said to him, See: thy faith has healed thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people when they saw [it] gave praise to God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he entered and passed through Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And behold, [there was] a man by name called Zacchaeus, and he was chief tax-gatherer, and he was rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he sought to see Jesus who he was: and he could not for the crowd, because he was little in stature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And running on before, he got up into a sycamore that he might see him, for he was going to pass that [way].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when he came up to the place, Jesus looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for to-day I must remain in thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he made haste and came down, and received him with joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And all murmured when they saw [it], saying, He has turned in to lodge with a sinful man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I return [him] fourfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jesus said to him, To-day salvation is come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But as they were listening to these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was about to be immediately manifested.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said therefore, A certain high-born man went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And having called his own ten bondmen, he gave to them ten minas, and said to them, Trade while I am coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not that this [man] should reign over us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass on his arrival back again, having received the kingdom, that he desired these bondmen to whom he gave the money to be called to him, in order that he might know what every one had gained by trading.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the first came up, saying, [My] Lord, thy mina has produced ten minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to him, Well [done], thou good bondman; because thou hast been faithful in that which is least, be thou in authority over ten cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the second came, saying, [My] Lord, thy mina has made five minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said also to this one, And *thou*, be over five cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And another came, saying, [My] Lord, lo, [there is] thy mina, which I have kept laid up in a towel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For I feared thee because thou art a harsh man: thou takest up what thou hast not laid down, and thou reapest what thou hast not sowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He says to him, Out of thy mouth will I judge thee, wicked bondman: thou knewest that *I* am a harsh man, taking up what I have not laid down and reaping what I have not sowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And why didst thou not give my money to [the] bank; and *I* should have received it, at my coming, with interest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he said to those that stood by, Take from him the mina and give [it] to him who has the ten minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For I say unto you, that to every one that has shall be given; but from him that has not, that even which he has shall be taken from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Moreover those mine enemies, who would not [have] me to reign over them, bring them here and slay [them] before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And having said these things, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it came to pass as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the mountain called [the mount] of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">saying, Go into the village over against [you], in which ye will find, on entering it, a colt tied up, on which no [child] of man ever sat at any time: loose it and lead it [here].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose [it]? thus shall ye say to him, Because the Lord has need of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they that were sent, having gone their way, found as he had said to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And as they were loosing the colt, its masters said to them, Why loose ye the colt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they said, Because the Lord has need of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they led it to Jesus; and having cast their own garments on the colt, they put Jesus on [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as he went, they strewed their clothes in the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And as he drew near, already at the descent of the mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began, rejoicing, to praise God with a loud voice for all the works of power which they had seen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">saying, Blessed the King that comes in the name of [the] Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he answering said to them, I say unto you, If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And as he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, even at least in this thy day, the things that are for thy peace: but now they are hid from thine eyes;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">for days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall make a palisaded mound about thee, and shall close thee around, and keep thee in on every side,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children in thee; and shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou knewest not the season of thy visitation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And entering into the temple, he began to cast out those that sold and bought in it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">saying to them, It is written, My house is a house of prayer, but *ye* have made it a den of robbers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And he was teaching day by day in the temple: and the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">and did not find what they could do, for all the people hung on him to hear.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and announcing the glad tidings, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and spoke to him saying, Tell us by what authority thou doest these things, or who is it who has given thee this authority?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he answering said to them, *I* also will ask you [one] thing, and tell me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The baptism of John, was it of heaven or of men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we should say, Of heaven, he will say, Why have ye not believed him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but if we should say, Of men, the whole people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they answered, they did not know whence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jesus said to them, Neither do *I* tell you by what authority I do these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he began to speak to the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen, and left the country for a long time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And in the season he sent to the husbandmen a bondman, that they might give to him of the fruit of the vineyard; but the husbandmen, having beaten him, sent [him] away empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And again he sent another bondman; but they, having beaten him also, and cast insult upon him, sent [him] away empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And again he sent a third; and they, having wounded him also, cast [him] out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: perhaps when they see him they will respect [him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; [come,] let us kill him, that the inheritance may become ours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And having cast him forth out of the vineyard, they killed [him]. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do to them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it they said, May it never be!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But he looking at them said, What then is this that is written, The stone which they that builded rejected, this has become the corner-stone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Every one falling on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the chief priests and the scribes sought the same hour to lay hands on him, and they feared the people; for they knew that he had spoken this parable of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And having watched [him], they sent out suborned persons, pretending to be just men, that they might take hold of him in [his] language, so that they might deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him saying, Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest no [man's] person, but teachest with truth the way of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But perceiving their deceit he said to them, Why do ye tempt me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Shew me a denarius. Whose image and superscription has it? And answering they said, Caesar's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said to them, Pay therefore what is Caesar's to Caesar, and what is God's to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they were not able to take hold of him in [his] expressions before the people, and, wondering at his answer, they were silent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection, coming up [to him],</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">demanded of him saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any one's brother, who has a wife, die, and he die childless, his brother shall take the wife and raise up seed to his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">There were then seven brethren: and the first, having taken a wife, died childless;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and the second [took the woman, and *he* died childless];</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and the third took her: and in like manner also the seven left no children and died;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">and last of all the woman also died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">In the resurrection therefore of which of them does she become wife, for the seven had her as wife?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus said to them, The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">but they who are counted worthy to have part in that world, and the resurrection from among [the] dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">for neither can they die any more, for they are equal to angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But that the dead rise, even Moses shewed in [the section of] the bush, when he called [the] Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">but he is not God of [the] dead but of [the] living; for all live for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And some of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For they did not dare any more to ask him anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he said to them, How do they say that the Christ is David's son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">until I put thine enemies [as] footstool of thy feet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And, as all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and who love salutations in the market-places, and first seats in the synagogues, and first places at suppers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">who devour the houses of widows, and as a pretext make long prayers. These shall receive a severer judgment.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he looked up and saw the rich casting their gifts into the treasury;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but he saw also a certain poor widow casting therein two mites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said, Verily I say unto you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for all these out of their abundance have cast into the gifts [of God]; but she out of her need has cast in all the living which she had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as some spoke of the temple, that it was adorned with goodly stones and consecrated offerings, he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">[As to] these things which ye are beholding, days are coming in which there shall not be left stone upon stone which shall not be thrown down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they asked him saying, Teacher, when then shall these things be; and what [is] the sign when these things are going to take place?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said, See that ye be not led astray, for many shall come in my name, saying, *I* am [he], and the time is drawn nigh: go ye not [therefore] after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when ye shall hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified, for these things must first take place, but the end is not immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then he said to them, Nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">there shall be both great earthquakes in different places, and famines and pestilences; and there shall be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And *they* began to question together among themselves who then it could be of them who was about to do this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And there was also a strife among them which of them should be held to be [the] greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said to them, The kings of the nations rule over them, and they that exercise authority over them are called benefactors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But *ye* [shall] not [be] thus; but let the greater among you be as the younger, and the leader as he that serves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For which [is] greater, he that is at table or he that serves? [Is] not he that is at table? But *I* am in the midst of you as the one that serves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But *ye* are they who have persevered with me in my temptations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And *I* appoint unto you, as my Father has appointed unto me, a kingdom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to have you, to sift [you] as wheat;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">but *I* have besought for thee that thy faith fail not; and *thou*, when once thou hast been restored, confirm thy brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he said to him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he said, I tell thee, Peter, [the] cock shall not crow to-day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he said to them, When I sent you without purse and scrip and sandals, did ye lack anything? And they said, Nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He said therefore to them, But now he that has a purse let him take [it], in like manner also a scrip, and he that has none let him sell his garment and buy a sword;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">for I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned with [the] lawless: for also the things concerning me have an end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And they said, Lord, behold here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And going forth he went according to his custom to the mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he was at the place he said to them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and having knelt down he prayed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">saying, Father, if thou wilt remove this cup from me: but then, not my will, but thine be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And an angel appeared to him from heaven strengthening him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And being in conflict he prayed more intently. And his sweat became as great drops of blood, falling down upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And rising up from his prayer, coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping from grief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And he said to them, Why sleep ye? rise up and pray that ye enter not into temptation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">As he was yet speaking, behold, a crowd, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went on before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And Jesus said to him, Judas, deliverest thou up the Son of man with a kiss?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And they who were around him, seeing what was going to follow, said [to him], Lord, shall we smite with [the] sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And a certain one from among them smote the bondman of the high priest and took off his right ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And Jesus answering said, Suffer thus far; and having touched his ear, he healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders, who were come against him, Have ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">When I was day by day with you in the temple ye did not stretch out your hands against me; but this is your hour and the power of darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And having laid hold on him, they led him [away], and they led [him] into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed afar off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And they having lit a fire in the midst of the court and sat down together, Peter sat among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And a certain maid, having seen him sitting by the light, and having fixed her eyes upon him, said, And this [man] was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">But he denied [him], saying, Woman, I do not know him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And after a short time another seeing him said, And *thou* art of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And after the lapse of about one hour another stoutly maintained it, saying, In truth this [man] also was with him, for also he is a Galilaean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, [the] cock crew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And the Lord, turning round, looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, Before [the] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And Peter, going forth without, wept bitterly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">And the men who held him mocked him, beating [him];</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">and covering him up, asked him saying, Prophesy, who is it that struck thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And they said many other injurious things to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">And when it was day, the elderhood of the people, both [the] chief priests and scribes, were gathered together, and led him into their council, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">If *thou* art the Christ, tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not at all believe;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">and if I should ask [you], ye would not answer me at all, nor let me go;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">but henceforth shall the Son of man be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">And they all said, *Thou* then art the Son of God? And he said to them, *Ye* say that I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And they said, What need have we any more of witness, for we have heard ourselves out of his mouth?</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the whole multitude of them, rising up, led him to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they began to accuse him, saying, We have found this [man] perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Pilate demanded of him saying, Art *thou* the king of the Jews? And he answering him said, Thou sayest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, I find no guilt in this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they insisted, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee even on to here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Pilate, having heard Galilee [named], demanded if the man were a Galilaean;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and having learned that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, remitted him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in those days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Herod saw Jesus he greatly rejoiced, for he had been a long while desirous of seeing him, because of hearing many things concerning him, and he hoped to see some sign done by him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and he questioned him in many words, but *he* answered him nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the chief priests and the scribes stood and accused him violently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Herod with his troops having set him at nought and mocked him, having put a splendid robe upon him, sent him back to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Pilate and Herod became friends with one another the same day, for they had been at enmity before between themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Pilate, having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">said to them, Ye have brought to me this man as turning away the people [to rebellion], and behold, I, having examined him before you, have found nothing criminal in this man as to the things of which ye accuse him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">nor Herod either, for I remitted you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Having chastised him therefore, I will release him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">( Now he was obliged to release one for them at the feast.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But they cried out in a mass saying, Away with this [man] and release Barabbas to us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who was one who, for a certain tumult which had taken place in the city, and [for] murder, had been cast into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Pilate therefore, desirous to release Jesus, again addressed [them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But they cried out in reply saying, Crucify, crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said the third time to them, What evil then has this [man] done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will chastise him therefore and release him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But they were urgent with loud voices, begging that he might be crucified. And their voices [and those of the chief priests] prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Pilate adjudged that what they begged should take place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he released him who, for tumult and murder, had been cast into prison, whom they begged for, and Jesus he delivered up to their will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And as they led him away, they laid hold on a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, and put the cross upon him to bear it behind Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And a great multitude of the people, and of women who wailed and lamented him, followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Jesus turning round to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over me, but weep over yourselves and over your children;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">for behold, days are coming in which they will say, Blessed [are] the barren, and wombs that have not borne, and breasts that have not given suck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us; and to the hills, Cover us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">for if these things are done in the green tree, what shall take place in the dry?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now two others also, malefactors, were led with him to be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they came to the place which is called Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, the other on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And, parting out his garments, they cast lots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the people stood beholding, and the rulers also [with them] sneered, saying, He has saved others; let him save himself if this is the Christ, the chosen one of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the soldiers also made game of him, coming up offering him vinegar,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">and saying, If *thou* be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And there was also an inscription [written] over him in Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew letters: This is the King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now one of the malefactors who had been hanged spoke insultingly to him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost *thou* too not fear God, thou that art under the same judgment?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">and *we* indeed justly, for we receive the just recompense of what we have done; but this [man] has done nothing amiss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he said to Jesus, Remember me, [Lord,] when thou comest in thy kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And it was about [the] sixth hour, and there came darkness over the whole land until [the] ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple rent in the midst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Jesus, having cried with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. And having said this, he expired.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Now the centurion, seeing what took place, glorified God, saying, In very deed this man was just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And all the crowds who had come together to that sight, having seen the things that took place, returned, beating [their] breasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And all those who knew him stood afar off, the women also who had followed him from Galilee, beholding these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good man and a just</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">(this [man] had not assented to their counsel and deed), of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who also waited, [himself also,] for the kingdom of God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">he having gone to Pilate begged the body of Jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and having taken it down, wrapped it in fine linen and placed him in a tomb hewn in the rock, where no one had ever been laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And it was preparation day, and [the] sabbath twilight was coming on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And women, who had come along with him out of Galilee, having followed, saw the sepulchre and how his body was placed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And having returned they prepared aromatic spices and ointments, and remained quiet on the sabbath, according to the commandment.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But on the morrow of the sabbath, very early indeed in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the aromatic spices which they had prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when they had entered they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass as they were in perplexity about it, that behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living one among the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you, being yet in Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">saying, The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and rise the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they remembered his words;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and, returning from the sepulchre, related all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now it was Mary of Magdala, and Johanna, and Mary the [mother] of James, and the others with them, who told these things to the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And their words appeared in their eyes as an idle tale, and they disbelieved them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Peter, rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping down he sees the linen clothes lying there alone, and went away home, wondering at what had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And behold, two of them were going on the same day to a village distant sixty stadia from Jerusalem, called Emmaus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and they conversed with one another about all these things which had taken place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass as they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus himself drawing nigh, went with them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">but their eyes were holden so as not to know him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to them, What discourses are these which pass between you as ye walk, and are downcast?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And one [of them], named Cleopas, answering said to him, Thou sojournest alone in Jerusalem, and dost not know what has taken place in it in these days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazaraean, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to [the] judgment of death and crucified him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But *we* had hoped that *he* was [the one] who is about to redeem Israel. But then, besides all these things, it is now, to-day, the third day since these things took place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And withal, certain women from amongst us astonished us, having been very early at the sepulchre,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and, not having found his body, came, saying that they also had seen a vision of angels, who say that he is living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And some of those with us went to the sepulchre, and found it so, as the women also had said, but him they saw not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And *he* said to them, O senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they drew near to the village where they were going, and *he* made as though he would go farther.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And they constrained him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is declining. And he entered in to stay with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it came to pass as he was at table with them, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken it, gave it to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And their eyes were opened, and they recognised him. And he disappeared from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in us as he spoke to us on the way, [and] as he opened the scriptures to us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">saying, The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they related what [had happened] on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst, and says to them, Peace [be] unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But they, being confounded and being frightened, supposed they beheld a spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why are thoughts rising in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">behold my hands and my feet, that it is *I* myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And having said this he shewed them his hands and his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But while they yet did not believe for joy, and were wondering, he said to them, Have ye anything here to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">and he took it and ate before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he said to them, These [are] the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And *ye* are witnesses of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And he led them out as far as Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he blessed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And it came to pass as he was blessing them, he was separated from them and was carried up into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And *they*, having done him homage, returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In [the] beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">*He* was in the beginning with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All things received being through him, and without him not one [thing] received being which has received being.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There was a man sent from God, his name John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He came for witness, that he might witness concerning the light, that all might believe through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">*He* was not the light, but that he might witness concerning the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was in the world, and the world had [its] being through him, and the world knew him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came to his own, and his own received him not;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">(John bears witness of him, and he has cried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me;)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask him, Thou, who art thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he acknowledged and denied not, and acknowledged, I am not the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, I [am] [the] voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of [the] Lord, as said Esaias the prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they were sent from among the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they asked him and said to him, Why baptisest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered them saying, I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he *was* before me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and I knew him not; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with [the] Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Again, on the morrow, there stood John and two of his disciples.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">but how he now sees we do not know, or who has opened his eyes we do not know. *He* is of age: ask *him*; *he* will speak concerning himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one confessed him [to be the] Christ, he should be excommunicated from the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">On this account his parents said, He is of age: ask *him*.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They called therefore a second time the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered therefore, If he is sinful I know not. One thing I know, that, being blind [before], now I see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they said to him again, What did he do to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He answered them, I told you already and ye did not hear: why do ye desire to hear again? do ye also wish to become his disciples?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They railed at him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">We know that God spoke to Moses; but [as to] this [man], we know not whence he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The man answered and said to them, Now in this is a wonderful thing, that *ye* do not know whence he is, and he has opened mine eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">[But] we know that God does not hear sinners; but if any one be God-fearing and do his will, him he hears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Since time was, it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of one born blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">If this [man] were not of God he would be able to do nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They answered and said to him, Thou hast been wholly born in sins, and thou teachest us? And they cast him out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him, he said to him, Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Jesus said, For judgment am I come into this world, that they which see not may see, and they which see may become blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And [some] of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, Are we blind also?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus said to them, If ye were blind ye would not have sin; but now ye say, We see, your sin remains.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Now the feast of the dedication was celebrating at Jerusalem, and it was winter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus walked in the temple in the porch of Solomon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye do not believe. The works which I do in my Father's name, these bear witness concerning me:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a certain [man] sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It was [the] Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when Jesus heard [it], he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore he heard, He is sick, he remained two days then in the place where he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then after this he says to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The disciples say to him, Rabbi, [even but] now the Jews sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither again?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walk in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">These things said he; and after this he says to them, Lazarus, our friend, is fallen asleep, but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The disciples therefore said to him, Lord, if he be fallen asleep, he will get well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Jesus spoke of his death, but *they* thought that he spoke of the rest of sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus therefore then said to them plainly, Lazarus has died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I rejoice on your account that I was not there, in order that ye may believe. But let us go to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Thomas therefore, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let *us* also go, that we may die with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus therefore [on] arriving found him to have been four days already in the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia off,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus wept.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus therefore, again deeply moved in himself, comes to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus says, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead, says to him, Lord, he stinks already, for he is four days [there].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus says to her, Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifted up his eyes on high and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="44">And the dead came forth, bound feet and hands with graveclothes, and his face was bound round with a handkerchief. Jesus says to them, Loose him and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Many therefore of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what he had done, believed on him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many signs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">If we let him thus alone, all will believe on him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="51">But this he did not say of himself; but, being high priest that year, prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and not for the nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">From that day therefore they took counsel that they might kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went away thence into the country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he sojourned with the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But the passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">They sought therefore Jesus, and said among themselves, standing in the temple, What do ye think? that he will not come to the feast?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment that if any one knew where he was, he should make it known, that they might take him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was the dead [man] Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from among [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There therefore they made him a supper, and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those at table with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">One of his disciples therefore, Judas [son] of Simon, Iscariote, who was about to deliver him up, says,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the bag, and carried what was put into [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to have kept this for the day of my preparation for burial;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">for ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A great crowd therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not because of Jesus only, but also that they might see Lazarus whom he raised from among [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the chief priests took counsel that they might kill Lazarus also,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">because many of the Jews went away on his account and believed on Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">On the morrow a great crowd who came to the feast, having heard that Jesus is coming into Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">took branches of palms and went out to meet him, and cried, Hosanna, blessed [is] he that comes in the name of [the] Lord, the King of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon it; as it is written,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore also the crowd met him because they had heard that he had done this sign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The Pharisees therefore said to one another, Ye see that ye profit nothing: behold, the world is gone after him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns put it on his head, and put a purple robe on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and came to him and said, Hail, king of the Jews! and gave him blows on the face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Pilate went out again and says to them, Lo, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find in him no fault whatever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">(Jesus therefore went forth without, wearing the crown of thorn, and the purple robe.) And he says to them, Behold the man!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they cried out saying, Crucify, crucify [him]. Pilate says to them, Take him ye and crucify [him], for I find no fault in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to [our] law he ought to die, because he made himself Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Pilate therefore heard this word, he was the rather afraid,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and went into the praetorium again and says to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Pilate therefore says to him, Speakest thou not to *me*? Dost thou not know that I have authority to release thee and have authority to crucify thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered, Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above. On this account he that has delivered me up to thee has [the] greater sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">From this time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews cried out saying, If thou releasest this [man], thou art not a friend to Caesar. Every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Pilate therefore, having heard these words, led Jesus out and sat down upon [the] judgment-seat, at a place called Pavement, but in Hebrew Gabbatha;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">(now it was [the] preparation of the passover; it was about the sixth hour;) and he says to the Jews, Behold your king!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But they cried out, Take [him] away, take [him] away, crucify him. Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then therefore he delivered him up to them, that he might be crucified; and they took Jesus and led him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he went out, bearing his cross, to the place called [place] of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">where they crucified him, and with him two others, [one] on this side, and [one] on that, and Jesus in the middle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the cross. But there was written: Jesus the Nazaraean, the King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">This title therefore many of the Jews read, for the place of the city where Jesus was crucified was near; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, Latin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The king of the Jews, but that *he* said, I am king of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothes, and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and the body-coat; but the body-coat was seamless, woven through the whole from the top.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They said therefore to one another, Let us not rend it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled which says, They parted my garments among themselves, and on my vesture they cast lots. The soldiers therefore did these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and the sister of his mother, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus therefore, seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he says unto the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">There was a vessel therefore there full of vinegar, and having filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting hyssop round it, they put it up to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When therefore Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and having bowed his head, he delivered up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews therefore, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for it was [the] preparation, (for the day of that sabbath was a great [day],) demanded of Pilate that their legs might be broken and they taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first and of the other that had been crucified with him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">but coming to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he who saw it bears witness, and his witness is true, and he knows that he says true that ye also may believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shall be broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly through fear of the Jews, demanded of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus: and Pilate allowed it. He came therefore and took away the body of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Nicodemus also, who at first came to Jesus by night, came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds [weight].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They took therefore the body of Jesus and bound it up in linen with the spices, as it is the custom with the Jews to prepare for burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But there was in the place where he had been crucified a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">There therefore, on account of the preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And on the first [day] of the week Mary of Magdala comes in early morn to the tomb, while it was still dark, and sees the stone taken away from the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">She runs therefore and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, to whom Jesus was attached, and says to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and came to the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the two ran together, and the other disciple ran forward faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying; he did not however go in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Simon Peter therefore comes, following him, and entered into the tomb, and sees the linen cloths lying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and the handkerchief which was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a distinct place by itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then entered in therefore the other disciple also who came first to the tomb, and he saw and believed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">for they had not yet known the scripture, that he must rise from among [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The disciples therefore went away again to their own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Mary stood at the tomb weeping without. As therefore she wept, she stooped down into the tomb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and beholds two angels sitting in white [garments], one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they say to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Having said these things she turned backward and beholds Jesus standing [there], and knew not that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus says to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? Whom seekest thou? She, supposing that it was the gardener, says to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus says to her, Mary. She, turning round, says to him in Hebrew, Rabboni, which means Teacher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus says to her, Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and [to] my God and your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Mary of Magdala comes bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] he had said these things to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first [day] of the week, and the doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace [be] to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And having said this, he shewed to them his hands and his side. The disciples rejoiced therefore, having seen the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">[Jesus] said therefore again to them, Peace [be] to you: as the Father sent me forth, I also send you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And having said this, he breathed into [them], and says to them, Receive [the] Holy Spirit:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever [sins] ye retain, they are retained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And eight days after, his disciples were again within, and Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace [be] to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he says to Thomas, Bring thy finger here and see my hands; and bring thy hand and put it into my side; and be not unbelieving, but believing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus says to him, Because thou hast seen me thou hast believed: blessed they who have not seen and have believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Many other signs therefore also Jesus did before his disciples, which are not written in this book;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">but these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. And he manifested [himself] thus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael who was of Cana of Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter says to them, I go to fish. They say to him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and went on board, and that night took nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And early morn already breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; the disciples however did not know that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus therefore says to them, Children, have ye anything to eat? They answered him, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said to them, Cast the net at the right side of the ship and ye will find. They cast therefore, and they could no longer draw it, from the multitude of fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It is the Lord. Simon Peter therefore, having heard that it was the Lord, girded his overcoat [on him] (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and the other disciples came in the small boat, for they were not far from the land, but somewhere about two hundred cubits, dragging the net of fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When therefore they went out on the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus says to them, Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Simon Peter went up and drew the net to the land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there were so many, the net was not rent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus says to them, Come [and] dine. But none of the disciples dared inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them, and the fish in like manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to the disciples, being risen from among [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When therefore they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He says to him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. He says to him, Feed my lambs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He says to him again a second time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? He says to him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. He says to him, Shepherd my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He says to him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, art thou attached to me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Art thou attached to me? and said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But he said this signifying by what death he should glorify God. And having said this, he says to him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Peter, turning round, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned at supper on his breast, and said, Lord, who is it that delivers thee up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Peter, seeing him, says to Jesus, Lord, and what [of] this [man]?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus says to him, If I will that he abide until I come, what [is that] to thee? Follow thou me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">This word therefore went out among the brethren, That disciple does not die. And Jesus did not say to him, He does not die; but, If I will that he abide until I come, what [is that] to thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his witness is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I composed the first discourse, O Theophilus, concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">until that day in which, having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">to whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and, being assembled with [them], commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, which [said he] ye have heard of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For John indeed baptised with water, but *ye* shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They therefore, being come together, asked him saying, Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said to them, It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And having said these things he was taken up, they beholding [him], and a cloud received him out of their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And as they were gazing into heaven, as he was going, behold, also two men stood by them in white clothing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">who also said, Men of Galilee, why do ye stand looking into heaven? This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called [the mount] of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day's journey off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when they were come into [the city], they went up to the upper chamber, where were staying both Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James [son] of Alphaeus, and Simon the zealot, and Jude [the brother] of James.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with [several] women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And in those days Peter, standing up in the midst of the brethren, said, (the crowd of names [who were] together [was] about a hundred and twenty,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Brethren, it was necessary that the scripture should have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before, by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who became guide to those who took Jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for he was numbered amongst us, and had received a part in this service.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">(This [man] then indeed got a field with [the] reward of iniquity, and, having fallen down headlong, burst in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it was known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own dialect Aceldama; that is, field of blood.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For it is written in [the] book of Psalms, Let his homestead become desolate, and let there be no dweller in it; and, Let another take his overseership.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with us all [the] time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us, one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they appointed two, Joseph, who was called Barsabas, who had been surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they prayed, and said, Thou Lord, knower of the hearts of all, shew which one of these two thou hast chosen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">to receive the lot of this service and apostleship, from which Judas transgressing fell to go to his own place.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them, Men of Judaea, and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give heed to my words:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">for these are not full of wine, as *ye* suppose, for it is the third hour of the day;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">and a certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they placed every day at the gate of the temple called Beautiful, to ask alms of those who were going into the temple;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">who, seeing Peter and John about to enter into the temple, asked to receive alms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Peter, looking stedfastly upon him with John, said, Look on us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Peter said, Silver and gold I have not; but what I have, this give I to thee: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean rise up and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And having taken hold of him [by] the right hand he raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones were made strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And leaping up he stood and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And all the people saw him walking and praising God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and they recognised him, that it was *he* who sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico which is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Peter, seeing it, answered the people, Men of Israel, why are ye astonished at this? or why do ye gaze on us as if we had by our own power or piety made him to walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom *ye* delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when *he* had judged that he should be let go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But *ye* denied the holy and righteous one, and asked that a man [that was] a murderer should be granted to you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but the originator of life ye slew, whom God raised from among [the] dead, whereof *we* are witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And, by faith in his name, his name has made this [man] strong whom ye behold and know; and the faith which is by him has given him this complete soundness in the presence of you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And now, brethren, I know that ye did it in ignorance, as also your rulers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">but God has thus fulfilled what he had announced beforehand by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Repent therefore and be converted, for the blotting out of your sins, so that times of refreshing may come from [the] presence of the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and he may send Jesus Christ, who was foreordained for you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">whom heaven indeed must receive till [the] times of [the] restoring of all things, of which God has spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets since time began.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Moses indeed said, A prophet shall [the] Lord your God raise up to you out of your brethren like me: him shall ye hear in everything whatsoever he shall say to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it shall be that whatsoever soul shall not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And indeed all the prophets from Samuel and those in succession after [him], as many as have spoken, have announced also these days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">*Ye* are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God appointed to our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">To you first God, having raised up his servant, has sent him, blessing you in turning each one [of you] from your wickedness.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">being distressed on account of their teaching the people and preaching by Jesus the resurrection from among [the] dead;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and they laid hands on them, and put them in ward till the morrow; for it was already evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But many of those who had heard the word believed; and the number of the men had become [about] five thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together at Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of [the] high priestly family;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and having placed them in the midst they inquired, In what power or in what name have *ye* done this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Peter, filled with [the] Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders [of Israel],</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">if *we* this day are called upon to answer as to the good deed [done] to the infirm man, how *he* has been healed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean, whom *ye* have crucified, whom God has raised from among [the] dead, by *him* this [man] stands here before you sound [in body].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">*He* is the stone which has been set at nought by you the builders, which is become the corner stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And salvation is in none other, for neither is there another name under heaven which is given among men by which we must be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and perceiving that they were unlettered and uninstructed men, they wondered; and they recognised them that they were with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And beholding the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to reply;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but having commanded them to go out of the council they conferred with one another,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed an evident sign has come to pass through their means is manifest to all that inhabit Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But that it be not further spread among the people, let us threaten them severely no longer to speak to any man in this name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And having called them, they charged [them] not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Peter and John answering said to them, If it be righteous before God to listen to you rather than to God, judge ye;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">for as for us *we* cannot refrain from speaking of the things which we have seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But they, having further threatened them, let them go, finding no way how they might punish them, on account of the people, because all glorified God for what had taken place;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">for the man on whom this sign of healing had taken place was above forty years old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having been let go, they came to their own [company], and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they, having heard [it], lifted up [their] voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord, *thou* art the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">who hast said by the mouth of thy servant David, Why have [the] nations raged haughtily and [the] peoples meditated vain things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The kings of the earth were there, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with [the] nations, and peoples of Israel, have been gathered together in this city</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had determined before should come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and give to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">in that thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and that signs and wonders take place through the name of thy holy servant Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the heart and soul of the multitude of those that had believed were one, and not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own, but all things were common to them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">and with great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For neither was there any one in want among them; for as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them, brought the price of what was sold</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">and laid it at the feet of the apostles; and distribution was made to each according as any one might have need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Joseph, who had been surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is, being interpreted, Son of consolation), a Levite, Cyprian by birth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">being possessed of land, having sold [it], brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and put aside for himself part of the price, [his] wife also being privy to it; and having brought a certain part, laid it at the feet of the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit, and put aside for thyself a part of the price of the estate?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">While it remained did it not remain to *thee*? and sold, was [it not] in thine own power? Why is it that thou hast purposed this thing in thine heart? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and expired. And great fear came upon all who heard [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the young men, rising up, swathed him up for burial, and having carried him out, buried him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to pass about three hours afterwards, that his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Peter answered her, Tell me if ye gave the estate for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Peter said to her, Why [is it] that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of [the] Lord? Lo, the feet of those that have buried thy husband [are] at the door, and they shall carry thee out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And she fell down immediately at his feet and expired. And when the young men came in they found her dead; and, having carried her out, they buried her by her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders done among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">but of the rest durst no man join them, but the people magnified them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and believers were more than ever added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">so that they brought out the sick into the streets and put [them] on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter, when he came, might overshadow some one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the multitude also of the cities round about came together to Jerusalem, bringing sick persons and persons beset by unclean spirits, who were all healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the high priest rising up, and all they that were with him, which is the sect of the Sadducees, were filled with wrath,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and laid hands on the apostles and put them in the public prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But an angel of [the] Lord during the night opened the doors of the prison, and leading them out, said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Go ye and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when they heard it, they entered very early into the temple and taught. And when the high priest was come, and they that were with him, they called together the council and all the elderhood of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when the officers were come, they did not find them in the prison; and returned and reported</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">saying, We found the prison shut with all security, and the keepers standing at the doors; but when we had opened [them], within we found no one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they heard these words, both the priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests were in perplexity as to them, what this would come to.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And some one coming reported to them, Lo, the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then the captain, having gone with the officers, brought them, not with violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And they bring them and set them in the council. And the high priest asked them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">saying, We strictly enjoined you not to teach in this name: and lo, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and purpose to bring upon us the blood of this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But Peter answering, and the apostles, said, God must be obeyed rather than men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus, whom *ye* have slain, having hanged on a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Him has God exalted by his right hand as leader and saviour, to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And *we* are [his] witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit also, which God has given to those that obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But they, when they heard [these things], were cut to the heart, and took counsel to kill them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But a certain [man], a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, held in honour of all the people, rose up in the council, and commanded to put the men out for a short while,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">and said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as regards these men what ye are going to do;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">for before these days Theudas rose up, alleging himself to be somebody, to whom a number of men, about four hundred, were joined; who was slain, and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed and came to nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">After him rose Judas the Galilean in the days of the census, and drew away [a number of] people after him; and *he* perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And now I say to you, Withdraw from these men and let them alone, for if this counsel or this work have its origin from men, it will be destroyed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">but if it be from God, ye will not be able to put them down, lest ye be found also fighters against God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And they listened to his advice; and having called the apostles, they beat them, and enjoined them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and dismissed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They therefore went their way from [the] presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be dishonoured for the name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And every day, in the temple and in the houses, they ceased not teaching and announcing the glad tidings that Jesus [was] the Christ.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But in those days, the disciples multiplying in number, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews because their widows were overlooked in the daily ministration.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the twelve, having called the multitude of the disciples to [them], said, It is not right that we, leaving the word of God, should serve tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Look out therefore, brethren, from among yourselves seven men, well reported of, full of [the] [Holy] Spirit and wisdom, whom we will establish over this business:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but *we* will give ourselves up to prayer and the ministry of the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and [the] Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">whom they set before the apostles; and, having prayed, they laid their hands on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was very greatly multiplied, and a great crowd of the priests obeyed the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought wonders and great signs among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there arose up certain of those of the synagogue called of freedmen, and of Cyrenians, and of Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then they suborned men, saying, We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the high priest said, Are these things then so?</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Saul was consenting to his being killed. And on that day there arose a great persecution against the assembly which was in Jerusalem, and all were scattered into the countries of Judaea and Samaria except the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And pious men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into the houses one after another, and dragging off both men and women delivered them up to prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Those then that had been scattered went through [the countries] announcing the glad tidings of the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Philip, going down to a city of Samaria, preached the Christ to them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and the crowds with one accord gave heed to the things spoken by Philip, when they heard [him] and saw the signs which he wrought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For from many who had unclean spirits they went out, crying with a loud voice; and many that were paralysed and lame were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there was great joy in that city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But a certain man, by name Simon, had been before in the city, using magic arts, and astonishing the nation of Samaria, saying that himself was some great one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">To whom they had all given heed, from small to great, saying, This is the power of God which is called great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they gave heed to him, because that for a long time he had astonished them by his magic arts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when they believed Philip announcing the glad tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Simon also himself believed; and, having been baptised, continued constantly with Philip; and, beholding the signs and great works of power which took place, was astonished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the apostles who were in Jerusalem, having heard that Samaria had received the word of God, sent to them Peter and John;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">who, having come down, prayed for them that they might receive [the] Holy Spirit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">for he was not yet fallen upon any of them, only they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then they laid their hands upon them, and they received [the] Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But Simon, having seen that by the laying on of the hands of the apostles the [Holy] Spirit was given, offered them money,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">saying, Give to me also this power, in order that on whomsoever I may lay hands he may receive [the] Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Peter said to him, Thy money go with thee to destruction, because thou hast thought that the gift of God can be obtained by money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not upright before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and supplicate the Lord, if indeed the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">for I see thee to be in the gall of bitterness, and bond of unrighteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Simon answering said, Supplicate *ye* for me to the Lord, so that nothing may come upon me of the things of which ye have spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They therefore, having testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and announced the glad tidings to many villages of the Samaritans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But [the] angel of [the] Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go southward on the way which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza: the same is desert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he rose up and went. And lo, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a man in power under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to worship at Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">was returning and sitting in his chariot: and he was reading the prophet Esaias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Philip, running up, heard him reading the prophet Esaias, and said, Dost thou then know what thou art reading of?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he said, How should I then be able unless some one guide me? And he begged Philip to come up and sit with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the passage of the scripture which he read was this: He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb in presence of him that shears him, thus he opens not his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">In his humiliation his judgment has been taken away, and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the eunuch answering Philip said, I pray thee, concerning whom does the prophet say this? of himself or of some other?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Philip, opening his mouth and beginning from that scripture, announced the glad tidings of Jesus to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they went along the way, they came upon a certain water, and the eunuch says, Behold water; what hinders my being baptised?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Not available</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he commanded the chariot to stop. And they went down both to the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptised him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But when they came up out of the water [the] Spirit of [the] Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no longer, for he went on his way rejoicing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Philip was found at Azotus, and passing through he announced the glad tidings to all the cities till he came to Caesarea.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, came to the high priest</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he [said], *I* am Jesus, whom *thou* persecutest.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And Ananias went and entered into the house; and laying his hands upon him he said, Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me, Jesus that appeared to thee in the way in which thou camest, that thou mightest see, and be filled with [the] Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he saw, and rising up was baptised;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and, having received food, got strength. And he was with the disciples who [were] in Damascus certain days.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But a certain man in Caesarea, by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italic,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">pious, and fearing God with all his house, [both] giving much alms to the people, and supplicating God continually,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he, having fixed his eyes upon him, and become full of fear, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms have gone up for a memorial before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And now send men to Joppa and fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He lodges with a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when the angel who was speaking to him had departed, having called two of his household and a pious soldier of those who were constantly with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and related all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And on the morrow, as these were journeying and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the house to pray, about the sixth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he became hungry and desired to eat. But as they were making ready an ecstasy came upon him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and he beholds the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as a great sheet, [bound] by [the] four corners [and] let down to the earth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">in which were all the quadrupeds and creeping things of the earth, and the fowls of the heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there was a voice to him, Rise, Peter, slay and eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Peter said, In no wise, Lord; for I have never eaten anything common or unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And [there was] a voice again the second time to him, What God has cleansed, do not *thou* make common.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And this took place thrice, and the vessel was straightway taken up into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And as Peter doubted in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold also the men who were sent by Cornelius, having sought out the house of Simon, stood at the gate,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and having called [some one], they inquired if Simon who was surnamed Peter was lodged there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But as Peter continued pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but rise up, go down, and go with them, nothing doubting, because *I* have sent them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Peter going down to the men said, Behold, *I* am he whom ye seek: what is the cause for which ye come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man, and fearing God, and borne witness to by the whole nation of the Jews, has been divinely instructed by a holy angel to send for thee to his house, and hear words from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Having therefore invited them in, he lodged them. And on the morrow, rising up he went away with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa went with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And on the morrow they came to Caesarea. But Cornelius was looking for them, having called together his kinsmen and [his] intimate friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when Peter was now coming in, Cornelius met him, and falling down did [him] homage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But Peter made him rise, saying, Rise up: *I* myself also am a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he went in, talking with him, and found many gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he said to them, *Ye* know how it is unlawful for a Jew to be joined or come to one of a strange race, and to *me* God has shewn to call no man common or unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Wherefore also, having been sent for, I came without saying anything against it. I inquire therefore for what reason ye have sent for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Cornelius said, Four days ago I had been [fasting] unto this hour, and the ninth [I was] praying in my house, and lo, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and said, Cornelius, thy prayer has been heard, and thy alms have come in remembrance before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Send therefore to Joppa and fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodges in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea [who when he is come will speak to thee].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and *thou* hast well done in coming. Now therefore *we* are all present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Peter opening his mouth said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, (*he* is Lord of all things,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">*ye* know; the testimony which has spread through the whole of Judaea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus who [was] of Nazareth: how God anointed him with [the] Holy Spirit and with power; who went through [all quarters] doing good, and healing all that were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">*We* also [are] witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom they also slew, having hanged him on a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">This [man] God raised up the third day and gave him to be openly seen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">not of all the people, but of witnesses who were chosen before of God, *us* who have eaten and drunk with him after he arose from among [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that *he* it is who was determinately appointed of God [to be] judge of living and dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">To him all the prophets bear witness that every one that believes on him will receive through his name remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">While Peter was yet speaking these words the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And the faithful of the circumcision were astonished, as many as came with Peter, that upon the nations also the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">for they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Can any one forbid water that these should not be baptised, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also [did]?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord. Then they begged him to stay some days.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">But Peter began and set forth [the matter] to them in order, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in an ecstasy I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending like a great sheet, let down by four corners out of heaven, and it came even to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">on which having fixed mine eyes, I considered, and saw the quadrupeds of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of the heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I heard also a voice saying to me, Rise up, Peter, slay and eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I said, In no wise, Lord, for common or unclean has never entered into my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What God has cleansed, do not *thou* make common.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">They then who had been scattered abroad through the tribulation that took place on the occasion of Stephen, passed through [the country] to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one but to Jews alone.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And having found [him], he brought him to Antioch. And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd: and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now in these days prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and one from among them, by name Agabus, rose up and signified by the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine over all the inhabited earth, which also came to pass under Claudius.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">whom Jason has received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying, that there is another king, Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they troubled the crowd and the politarchs when they heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And having taken security of Jason and the rest, they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the brethren immediately sent away, in the night, Paul and Silas to Berea; who, being arrived, went away into the synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, receiving the word with all readiness of mind, daily searching the scriptures if these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore many from among them believed, and of Grecian women of the upper classes and men not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the word of God was announced in Berea also by Paul, they came there also, stirring up the crowds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as to the sea; but Silas and Timotheus abode there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and, having received a commandment to Silas and Timotheus, that they should come to him as quickly as possible, they departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But in Athens, while Paul was waiting for them, his spirit was painfully excited in him seeing the city given up to idolatry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He reasoned therefore in the synagogue with the Jews, and those who worshipped, and in the market-place every day with those he met with.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers attacked him. And some said, What would this chatterer say? and some, He seems to be an announcer of foreign demons, because he announced the glad tidings of Jesus and the resurrection [to them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And having taken hold on him they brought [him] to Areopagus, saying, Might we know what this new doctrine which is spoken by thee [is]?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears. We wish therefore to know what these things may mean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now all [the] Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else than to tell and to hear the news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Paul standing in the midst of Areopagus said, Athenians, in every way I see you given up to demon worship;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">for, passing through and beholding your shrines, I found also an altar on which was inscribed, To the unknown God. Whom therefore ye reverence, not knowing [him], him I announce to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The God who has made the world and all things which are in it, *he*, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">nor is served by men's hands as needing something, himself giving to all life and breath and all things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and has made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, having determined ordained times and the boundaries of their dwelling,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">that they may seek God; if indeed they might feel after him and find him, although he is not far from each one of us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for in him we live and move and exist; as also some of the poets amongst you have said, For we are also his offspring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Being therefore [the] offspring of God, we ought not to think that which is divine to be like gold or silver or stone, [the] graven form of man's art and imagination.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">God therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, now enjoins men that they shall all everywhere repent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">because he has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by [the] man whom he has appointed, giving the proof [of it] to all [in] having raised him from among [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And when they heard [of the] resurrection of the dead, some mocked, and some said, We will hear thee again also concerning this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Thus Paul went out of their midst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But some men joining themselves to him believed; among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after these things, having left Athens, he came to Corinth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and finding a certain Jew by name Aquila, of Pontus by race, just come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, (because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome,) came to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and because they were of the same trade abode with them, and wrought. For they were tent-makers by trade.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in respect of the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But as they opposed and spoke injuriously, he shook his clothes, and said to them, Your blood be upon your own head: *I* [am] pure; from henceforth I will go to the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And departing thence he came to the house of a certain [man], by name Justus, who worshipped God, whose house adjoined the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Lord said by vision in [the] night to Paul, Fear not, but speak and be not silent;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">because *I* am with thee, and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he remained [there] a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one consent rose against Paul and led him to the judgment-seat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">saying, This [man] persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But as Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed it was some wrong or wicked criminality, O Jews, of reason I should have borne with you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but if it be questions about words, and names, and the law that ye have, see to it yourselves; [for] *I* do not intend to be judge of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he drove them from the judgment-seat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And having all laid hold on Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, they beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio troubled himself about none of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Paul, having yet stayed [there] many days, took leave of the brethren and sailed thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and he arrived at Ephesus, and left them there. But entering himself into the synagogue he reasoned with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when they asked him that he would remain for a longer time [with them] he did not accede,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but bade them farewell, saying, [I must by all means keep the coming feast at Jerusalem]; I will return to you again, if God will: and he sailed away from Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And landing at Caesarea, and having gone up and saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having stayed [there] some time, he went forth, passing in order through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, establishing all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, who was mighty in the scriptures, arrived at Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in his spirit, he spoke and taught exactly the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And *he* began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to [them] and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when he purposed to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples engaging them to receive him, who, being come, contributed much to those who believed through grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he with great force convinced the Jews publicly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper districts, came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">he said to them, Did ye receive [the] Holy Spirit when ye had believed? And they [said] to him, We did not even hear if [the] Holy Spirit was [come].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said, To what then were ye baptised? And they said, To the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Paul said, John indeed baptised [with] the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on him that was coming after him, that is, on Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when they heard that, they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Paul having laid [his] hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And all the men were about twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly during three months, reasoning and persuading [the things] concerning the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when some were hardened and disbelieved, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, he left them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this took place for two years, so that all that inhabited Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God wrought no ordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so that even napkins or aprons were brought from his body [and put] upon the sick, and the diseases left them, and the wicked spirits went out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And certain of the Jewish exorcists also, who went about, took in hand to call upon those who had wicked spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preaches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there were certain [men], seven sons of Sceva, Jewish high priest, who were doing this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the wicked spirit answering said to them, Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; but *ye*, who are ye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the man in whom the wicked spirit was leaped upon them, and having mastered both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who inhabited Ephesus, and fear fell upon all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And many of those that believed came confessing and declaring their deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And many of those that practised curious arts brought their books [of charms] and burnt them before all. And they reckoned up the prices of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thus with might the word of the Lord increased and prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, After I have been there I must see Rome also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And having sent into Macedonia two of those ministering to him, Timotheus and Erastus, he remained himself awhile in Asia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there took place at that time no small disturbance about the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For a certain [man] by name Demetrius, a silver-beater, making silver temples of Artemis, brought no small gain to the artisans;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">whom having brought together, and those who wrought in such things, he said, Men, ye know that our well-living arises from this work,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and ye see and hear that this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great crowd, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, saying that they are no gods which are made with hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now not only there is danger for us that our business come into discredit, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be counted for nothing, and that her greatness should be destroyed whom the whole of Asia and the world reveres.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And having heard [this], and being filled with rage, they cried out, saying, Great [is] Artemis of the Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the [whole] city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord to the theatre, having seized and carried off with [them] Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, fellow-travellers of Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But Paul intending to go in to the people, the disciples suffered him not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and some of the Asiarchs also, who were his friends, sent to him and urged him not to throw himself into the theatre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Different persons therefore cried out some different thing; for the assembly was tumultuous, and the most did not know for what cause they had come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But from among the crowd they put forward Alexander, the Jews pushing him forward. And Alexander, beckoning with his hand, would have made a defence to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But, recognising that he was a Jew, there was one cry from all, shouting for about two hours, Great [is] Artemis of the Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the townclerk, having quieted the crowd, said, Ephesians, what man is there then who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of Artemis the great, and of the [image] which fell down from heaven?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">These things therefore being undeniable, it is necessary that ye should be calm and do nothing headlong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For ye have brought these men, [who are] neither temple-plunderers, nor speak injuriously of your goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">If therefore Demetrius and the artisans who [are] with him have a matter against any one, the courts are being held, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if ye inquire anything concerning other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For also we are in danger to be put in accusation for sedition for this [affair] of to-day, no cause existing in reference to which we shall be able to give a reason for this concourse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But after the tumult had ceased, Paul having called the disciples to [him] and embraced [them], went away to go to Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And having passed through those parts, and having exhorted them with much discourse, he came to Greece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And having spent three months [there], a treacherous plot against him having been set on foot by the Jews, as he was going to sail to Syria, [the] resolution was adopted of returning through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater [son] of Pyrrhus, a Berean; and of Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius and Timotheus of Derbe, and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">These going before waited for us in Troas;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and we came to them to Troas in five days, where we spent seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed to them, about to depart on the morrow. And he prolonged the discourse till midnight.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And a certain youth, by name Eutychus, sitting at the window-opening, overpowered by deep sleep, while Paul discoursed very much at length, having been overpowered by the sleep, fell from the third story down to the bottom, and was taken up dead.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">But as he was about to be led into the fortress, Paul says to the chiliarch, Is it allowed me to say something to thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Thou art not then that Egyptian who before these days raised a sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But Paul said, *I* am a Jew of Tarsus, citizen of no insignificant city of Cilicia, and I beseech of thee, allow me to speak to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he had allowed him, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people; and a great silence having been made, he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Brethren and fathers, hear my defence which I now make to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And hearing that he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more quiet; and he says,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">*I* am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, educated according to [the] exactness of the law of [our] fathers, being zealous for God, as *ye* are all this day;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who have persecuted this way unto death, binding and delivering up to prisons both men and women;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the elderhood: from whom also, having received letters to the brethren, I went to Damascus to bring those also who were there, bound, to Jerusalem, to be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, as I was journeying and drawing near to Damascus, that, about mid-day, there suddenly shone out of heaven a great light round about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And *I* answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, *I* am Jesus the Nazaraean, whom *thou* persecutest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But they that were with me beheld the light, [and were filled with fear], but heard not the voice of him that was speaking to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rise up, and go to Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all things which it is appointed thee to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as I could not see, through the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came to Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And a certain Ananias, a pious man according to the law, borne witness to by all the Jews who dwelt [there],</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">coming to me and standing by me, said to me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And *I*, in the same hour, received my sight and saw him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen thee beforehand to know his will, and to see the just one, and to hear a voice out of his mouth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">for thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And now why lingerest thou? Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away, calling on his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass when I had returned to Jerusalem, and as I was praying in the temple, that I became in ecstasy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and saw him saying to me, Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And *I* said, Lord, they themselves know that *I* was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue those that believe on thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and when the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed, I also myself was standing by and consenting, and kept the clothes of them who killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said to me, Go, for *I* will send thee to the nations afar off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they heard him until this word, and lifted up their voice, saying, Away with such a one as that from the earth, for it was not fit he should live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as they were crying, and throwing away their clothes, and casting dust into the air,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">the chiliarch commanded him to be brought into the fortress, saying that he should be examined by scourging, that he might ascertain for what cause they cried thus against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But as they stretched him forward with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood [by], Is it lawful for you to scourge a man [who is] a Roman and uncondemned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the centurion, having heard it, went and reported it to the chiliarch, saying, What art thou going to do? for this man is a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the chiliarch coming up said to him, Tell me, Art *thou* a Roman? And he said, Yes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the chiliarch answered, *I*, for a great sum, bought this citizenship. And Paul said, But *I* was also [free] born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Immediately therefore those who were going to examine him left him, and the chiliarch also was afraid when he ascertained that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And on the morrow, desirous to know the certainty [of the matter] why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and having brought Paul down set him before them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Paul, fixing his eyes on the council, said, Brethren, I have walked in all good conscience with God unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the high priest Ananias ordered those standing by him to smite his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Paul said to him, God will smite thee, whited wall. And *thou*, dost thou sit judging me according to the law, and breaking the law commandest me to be smitten?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And those that stood by said, Dost thou rail against the high priest of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Paul said, I was not conscious, brethren, that he was high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evilly of the ruler of thy people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Paul, knowing that the one part [of them] were of the Sadducees and the other of the Pharisees, cried out in the council, Brethren, *I* am a Pharisee, son of Pharisees: *I* am judged concerning the hope and resurrection of [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he had spoken this, there was a tumult of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For Sadducees say there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but Pharisees confess both of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there was a great clamour, and the scribes of the Pharisees' part rising up contended, saying, We find nothing evil in this man; and if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a great tumult having arisen, the chiliarch, fearing lest Paul should have been torn in pieces by them, commanded the troop to come down and take him by force from the midst of them, and to bring [him] into the fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the following night the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good courage; for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must bear witness at Rome also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when it was day, the Jews, having banded together, put themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they should kill Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they were more than forty who had joined together in this oath;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and they went to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have cursed ourselves with a curse to taste nothing until we kill Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore do ye with the council make a representation to the chiliarch so that he may bring him down to you, as about to determine more precisely what concerns him, and we, before he draws near, are ready to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Paul's sister's son, having heard of the lying in wait, came and entered into the fortress and reported [it] to Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Paul, having called one of the centurions, said, Take this youth to the chiliarch, for he has something to report to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He therefore, having taken him with [him], led him to the chiliarch, and says, The prisoner Paul called me to [him] and asked me to lead this youth to thee, who has something to say to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the chiliarch having taken him by the hand, and having gone apart in private, inquired, What is it that thou hast to report to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, The Jews have agreed together to make a request to thee, that thou mayest bring Paul down to-morrow into the council, as about to inquire something more precise concerning him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Do not thou then be persuaded by them, for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have put themselves under a curse neither to eat nor drink till they kill him; and now they are ready waiting the promise from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The chiliarch then dismissed the youth, commanding [him], Utter to no one that thou hast represented these things to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having called to [him] certain two of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers that they may go as far as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred light-armed footmen, for the third hour of the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And [he ordered them] to provide beasts, that they might set Paul on them and carry [him] safe through to Felix the governor,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix, greeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This man, having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them, I came up with the military and took out [of their hands], having learned that he was a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And desiring to know the charge on which they accused him, I brought him down to their council;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">whom I found to be accused of questions of their law, but to have no charge laid against him [making him] worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But having received information of a plot about to be put in execution against the man [by the Jews], I have immediately sent him to thee, commanding also his accusers to say before thee the things that are against him. [Farewell.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The soldiers therefore, according to what was ordered them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">and on the morrow, having left the horsemen to go with him, returned to the fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And these, having entered into Caesarea, and given up the letter to the governor, presented Paul also to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And having read [it], and asked of what eparchy he was, and learned that [he was] of Cilicia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">he said, I will hear thee fully when thine accusers also are arrived. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's praetorium.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after five days came down the high priest Ananias, with the elders, and a certain orator called Tertullus, and laid their informations against Paul before the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying, Seeing we enjoy great peace through thee, and that excellent measures are executed for this nation by thy forethought,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">we receive [it] always and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But that I may not too much intrude on thy time, I beseech thee to hear us briefly in thy kindness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Jews also joined in pressing the matter against [Paul], saying that these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Paul, the governor having beckoned to him to speak, answered, Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge to this nation, I answer readily as to the things which concern myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As thou mayest know that there are not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and neither in the temple did they find me discoursing to any one, or making any tumultuous gathering together of the crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">neither can they make good the things of which they now accuse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But this I avow to thee, that in the way which they call sect, so I serve my fathers' God, believing all things which are written throughout the law, and in the prophets;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">For this cause I also exercise [myself] to have in everything a conscience without offence towards God and men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And after a lapse of many years I arrived, bringing alms to my nation, and offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whereupon they found me purified in the temple, with neither crowd nor tumult. But it was certain Jews from Asia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who ought to appear before thee and accuse, if they have anything against me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">or let these themselves say what wrong they found in me when I stood before the council,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">And as he reasoned concerning righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment about to come, Felix, being filled with fear, answered, Go for the present, and when I get an opportunity I will send for thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">hoping at the same time that money would be given him by Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener and communed with him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Festus therefore, being come into the eparchy, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">asking as a grace against him that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying people in wait to kill him on the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Festus therefore answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to set out shortly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let therefore the persons of authority among you, says he, going down too, if there be anything in this man, accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And having remained among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day, having sat down on the judgment-seat, commanded Paul to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he was come, the Jews who were come down from Jerusalem stood round, bringing many and grievous charges which they were not able to prove:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Paul answering for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I offended [in] anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Festus, desirous of obliging the Jews, to acquire their favour, answering Paul, said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, there to be judged before me concerning these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Paul said, I am standing before the judgment-seat of Caesar, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews have I done no wrong, as *thou* also very well knowest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If then I have done any wrong and committed anything worthy of death, I do not deprecate dying; but if there is nothing of those things of which they accuse me, no man can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Festus, having conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed to Caesar. To Caesar shalt thou go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when certain days had elapsed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to salute Festus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they had spent many days there, Festus laid before the king the matters relating to Paul, saying, There is a certain man left prisoner by Felix,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">concerning whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid informations, requiring judgment against him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to whom I answered, It is not [the] custom of the Romans to give up any man before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and he have got opportunity of defence touching the charge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When therefore they had come together here, without putting it off, I sat the next day on the judgment-seat and commanded the man to be brought:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">concerning whom the accusers, standing up, brought no such accusation of guilt as *I* supposed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but had against him certain questions of their own system of worship, and concerning a certain Jesus who is dead, whom Paul affirmed to be living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And as I myself was at a loss as to an inquiry into these things, I said, Was he willing to go to Jerusalem and there to be judged concerning these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Paul having appealed to be kept for the cognisance of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I shall send him to Caesar.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">On the morrow therefore, Agrippa being come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and having entered into the hall of audience, with the chiliarchs and the men of distinction of the city, and Festus having given command, Paul was brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye see this person, concerning whom all the multitude of the Jews applied to me both in Jerusalem and here, crying out against [him] that he ought not to live any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I, having found that he had done nothing worthy of death, and this [man] himself having appealed to Augustus, I have decided to send him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">concerning whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord. Wherefore I have brought him before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, so that an examination having been gone into I may have something to write:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching out his hand answered in his defence:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Why should it be judged a thing incredible in your sight if God raises the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">*I* indeed myself thought that I ought to do much against the name of Jesus the Nazaraean.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">at mid-day, on the way, I saw, O king, a light above the brightness of the sun, shining from heaven round about me and those who were journeying with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And, when we were all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? [it is] hard for thee to kick against goads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, *I* am Jesus whom *thou* persecutest:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">but rise up and stand on thy feet; for, for this purpose have I appeared to thee, to appoint thee to be a servant and a witness both of what thou hast seen, and of what I shall appear to thee in,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">taking thee out from among the people, and the nations, to whom *I* send thee,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but have, first to those both in Damascus and Jerusalem, and to all the region of Judaea, and to the nations, announced that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">On account of these things the Jews, having seized me in the temple, attempted to lay hands on and destroy me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Having therefore met with [the] help which is from God, I have stood firm unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing else than those things which both the prophets and Moses have said should happen,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And as he answered for his defence with these things, Festus says with a loud voice, Thou art mad, Paul; much learning turns thee to madness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Paul said, I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but utter words of truth and soberness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for the king is informed about these things, to whom also I speak with all freedom. For I am persuaded that of these things nothing is hidden from him; for this was not done in a corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Agrippa [said] to Paul, In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But the centurion believed rather the helmsman and the shipowner than what was said by Paul.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And [the] south wind blowing gently, supposing that they had gained their object, having weighed anchor they sailed close in shore along Crete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But not long after there came down it a hurricane called Euroclydon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the ship being caught and driven, and not able to bring her head to the wind, letting her go we were driven [before it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But running under the lee of a certain island called Clauda, we were with difficulty able to make ourselves masters of the boat;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">which having hoisted up, they used helps, frapping the ship; and fearing lest they should run into Syrtis and run aground, and having lowered the gear they were so driven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the storm being extremely violent on us, on the next day they threw cargo overboard,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and on the third day with their own hands they cast away the ship furniture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and no small storm lying on us, in the end all hope of our being saved was taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when they had been a long while without taking food, Paul then standing up in the midst of them said, Ye ought, O men, to have hearkened to me, and not have made sail from Crete and have gained this disaster and loss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now I exhort you to be of good courage, for there shall be no loss at all of life of [any] of you, only of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For an angel of the God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood by me this night,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted to thee all those that sail with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Wherefore be of good courage, men, for I believe God that thus it shall be, as it has been said to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But we must be cast ashore on a certain island.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when the fourteenth night was come, we being driven about in Adria, towards the middle of the night the sailors supposed that some land neared them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and having sounded found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther and having again sounded they found fifteen fathoms;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and fearing lest we should be cast on rocky places, casting four anchors out of the stern, they wished that day were come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But the sailors wishing to flee out of the ship, and having let down the boat into the sea under pretext of being about to carry out anchors from the prow,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these abide in the ship *ye* cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and let her fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And while it was drawing on to daylight, Paul exhorted them all to partake of food, saying, Ye have passed the fourteenth day watching in expectation without taking food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Wherefore I exhort you to partake of food, for this has to do with your safety; for not a hair from the head of any one of you shall perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And, having said these things and taken a loaf, he gave thanks to God before all, and having broken it began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And all taking courage, themselves also took food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And we were in the ship, all the souls, two hundred and seventy-six.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And having satisfied themselves with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when it was day they did not recognise the land; but they perceived a certain bay having a strand, on which they were minded, if they should be able, to run the ship ashore;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and, having cast off the anchors, they left [them] in the sea, at the same time loosening the lashings of the rudders, and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the strand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground, and the prow having stuck itself fast remained unmoved, but the stern was broken by the force of the waves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And [the] counsel of the soldiers was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim off and escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the centurion, desirous of saving Paul, hindered them of their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim, casting themselves first [into the sea], to get out on land;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and the rest, some on boards, some on some of the things [that came] from the ship; and thus it came to pass that all got safe to land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when we got safe [to land] we then knew that the island was called Melita.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the barbarians shewed us no common kindness; for, having kindled a fire, they took us all in because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Paul having gathered a [certain] quantity of sticks together in a bundle and laid [it] on the fire, a viper coming out from the heat seized his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said to one another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom, [though] saved out of the sea, Nemesis has not allowed to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">*He* however, having shaken off the beast into the fire, felt no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But *they* expected that he would have swollen or fallen down suddenly dead. But when they had expected a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, changing their opinion, they said he was a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now in the country surrounding that place were the lands belonging to the chief man of the island, by name Publius, who received us and gave [us] hospitality three days in a very friendly way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it happened that the father of Publius lay ill of fever and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and having prayed and laid his hands on him cured him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But this having taken place, the rest also who had sicknesses in the island came and were healed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">who also honoured us with many honours, and on our leaving they made presents to us of what should minister to our wants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And after three months we sailed in a ship which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian, with [the] Dioscuri for its ensign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And having come to Syracuse we remained three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Whence, going in a circuitous course, we arrived at Rhegium; and after one day, the wind having changed to south, on the second day we came to Puteoli,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">where, having found brethren, we were begged to stay with them seven days. And thus we went to Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And thence the brethren, having heard about us, came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Tres Tabernae, whom when Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when we came to Rome, [the centurion delivered up the prisoners to the praetorian prefect, but] Paul was allowed to remain by himself with the soldier who kept him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass after three days, that he called together those who were the chief of the Jews; and when they had come together he said to them, Brethren, *I* having done nothing against the people or the customs of our forefathers, have been delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">who having examined me were minded to let me go, because there was nothing worthy of death in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But the Jews speaking against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not as having anything to accuse my nation of.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For this cause therefore I have called you to [me] to see and to speak to you; for on account of the hope of Israel I have this chain about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they said to him, For our part, we have neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor has any one of the brethren who has arrived reported or said anything evil concerning thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But we beg to hear of thee what thou thinkest, for as concerning this sect it is known to us that it is everywhere spoken against.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having appointed him a day many came to him to the lodging, to whom he expounded, testifying of the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from early morning to evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And some were persuaded of the things which were said, but some disbelieved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And being disagreed among themselves they left; Paul having spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Spirit through Esaias the prophet to our fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear and not understand, and seeing ye shall see and not perceive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the heart of this people has become fat, and they hear heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Be it known to you therefore, that this salvation of God has been sent to the nations; *they* also will hear [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">[And he having said this, the Jews went away, having great reasoning among themselves.]</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, bondman of Jesus Christ, [a] called apostle, separated to God's glad tidings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(which he had before promised by his prophets in holy writings,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">concerning his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">marked out Son of God in power, according to [the] Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of [the] dead) Jesus Christ our Lord;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">by whom we have received grace and apostleship in behalf of his name, for obedience of faith among all the nations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">among whom are *ye* also [the] called of Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and [our] Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">always beseeching at my prayers, if any way now at least I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I greatly desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to establish you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that is, to have mutual comfort among you, each by the faith [which is] in the other, both yours and mine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that I often proposed to come to you, (and have been hindered until the present time,) that I might have some fruit among you too, even as among the other nations also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am a debtor both to Greeks and barbarians, both to wise and unintelligent:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">so, as far as depends on me, am I ready to announce the glad tidings to you also who [are] in Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For I am not ashamed of the glad tidings; for it is God's power to salvation, to every one that believes, both to Jew first and to Greek:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for righteousness of God is revealed therein, on the principle of faith, to faith: according as it is written, But the just shall live by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there is revealed wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety, and unrighteousness of men holding the truth in unrighteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Because what is known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested [it] to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">for from [the] world's creation the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity, so as to render them inexcusable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Because, knowing God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but fell into folly in their thoughts, and their heart without understanding was darkened:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into [the] likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and quadrupeds and reptiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Wherefore God gave them up [also] in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies between themselves:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">who changed the truth of God into falsehood, and honoured and served the creature more than him who had created [it], who is blessed for ever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For this reason God gave them up to vile lusts; for both their females changed the natural use into that contrary to nature;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and in like manner the males also, leaving the natural use of the female, were inflamed in their lust towards one another; males with males working shame, and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was fit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And according as they did not think good to have God in [their] knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind to practise unseemly things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil dispositions; whisperers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">back-biters, hateful to God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">void of understanding, faithless, without natural affection, unmerciful;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">who knowing the righteous judgment of God, that they who do such things are worthy of death, not only practise them, but have fellow delight in those who do [them].</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, every one who judgest, for in that in which thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And thinkest thou this, O man, who judgest those that do such things, and practisest them [thyself], that *thou* shalt escape the judgment of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to repentance?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but, according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up to thyself wrath, in [the] day of wrath and revelation of [the] righteous judgment of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who shall render to each according to his works:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">to them who, in patient continuance of good works, seek for glory and honour and incorruptibility, life eternal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But to those that are contentious, and are disobedient to the truth, but obey unrighteousness, [there shall be] wrath and indignation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">tribulation and distress, on every soul of man that works evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">but glory and honour and peace to every one that works good, both to Jew first and to Greek:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">for there is no acceptance of persons with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For as many as have sinned without law shall perish also without law; and as many as have sinned under law shall be judged by law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">(for not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For when [those of the] nations, which have no law, practise by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law to themselves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or else excusing themselves between themselves;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">in [the] day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my glad tidings, by Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if *thou* art named a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast in God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and knowest the will, and discerningly approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and hast confidence that thou thyself art a leader of the blind, a light of those who [are] in darkness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">thou that sayest [man should] not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">thou who boastest in law, dost thou by transgression of the law dishonour God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For the name of God is blasphemed on your account among the nations, according as it is written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For circumcision indeed profits if thou keep [the] law; but if thou be a law-transgressor, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If therefore the uncircumcision keep the requirements of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and uncircumcision by nature, fulfilling the law, judge thee, who, with letter and circumcision, [art] a law-transgressor?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he is not a Jew who [is] one outwardly, neither that circumcision which is outward in flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">but he [is] a Jew [who is so] inwardly; and circumcision, of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What then [is] the superiority of the Jew? or what the profit of circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Much every way: and first, indeed, that to them were entrusted the oracles of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what? if some have not believed, shall their unbelief make the faith of God of none effect?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Far be the thought: but let God be true, and every man false; according as it is written, So that thou shouldest be justified in thy words, and shouldest overcome when thou art in judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if our unrighteousness commend God's righteousness, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak according to man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Far be the thought: since how shall God judge the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if the truth of God, in my lie, has more abounded to his glory, why yet am *I* also judged as a sinner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and not, according as we are injuriously charged, and according as some affirm that we say, Let us practise evil things, that good ones may come? whose judgment is just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What then? are we better? No, in no wise: for we have before charged both Jews and Greeks with being all under sin:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">according as it is written, There is not a righteous [man], not even one;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">there is not the [man] that understands, there is not one that seeks after God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All have gone out of the way, they have together become unprofitable; there is not one that practises goodness, there is not so much as one:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; asps' poison [is] under their lips:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">swift their feet to shed blood;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">ruin and misery [are] in their ways,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and way of peace they have not known:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">there is no fear of God before their eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now we know that whatever the things the law says, it speaks to those under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be under judgment to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wherefore by works of law no flesh shall be justified before him; for by law [is] knowledge of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But now without law righteousness of God is manifested, borne witness to by the law and the prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ towards all, and upon all those who believe: for there is no difference;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which [is] in Christ Jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood, for [the] shewing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for [the] shewing forth of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just, and justify him that is of [the] faith of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Where then [is] boasting? It has been excluded. By what law? of works? Nay, but by law of faith;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for we reckon that a man is justified by faith, without works of law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Is [God] the God of Jews only? is he not of [the] nations also? Yea, of nations also:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">since indeed [it is] one God who shall justify [the] circumcision on the principle of faith, and uncircumcision by faith.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">What shall we say then that Abraham our father according to flesh has found?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">for what does the scripture say? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now to him that works the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but of debt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but to him who does not work, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Even as David also declares the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness without works:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Blessed [they] whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">[Does] this blessedness then [rest] on the circumcision, or also on the uncircumcision? For we say that faith has been reckoned to Abraham as righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">How then has it been reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he received [the] sign of circumcision [as] seal of the righteousness of faith which [he had] being in uncircumcision, that he might be [the] father of all them that believe being in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned to them also;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For [it was] not by law that the promise was to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of [the] world, but by righteousness of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if they which [are] of law be heirs, faith is made vain, and the promise made of no effect.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore [it is] on the principle of faith, that [it might be] according to grace, in order to the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that only which [is] of the law, but to that also which [is] of Abraham's faith, who is father of us all,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">(according as it is written, I have made thee father of many nations,) before the God whom he believed, who quickens the dead, and calls the things which be not as being;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">who against hope believed in hope to his becoming father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body already become dead, being about a hundred years old, and the deadening of Sarah's womb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and hesitated not at the promise of God through unbelief; but found strength in faith, giving glory to God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and being fully persuaded that what he has promised he is able also to do;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">by whom we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And not only [that], but we also boast in tribulations, knowing that tribulation works endurance;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and endurance, experience; and experience, hope;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by [the] Holy Spirit which has been given to us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">for we being still without strength, in [the] due time Christ has died for [the] ungodly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For scarcely for [the] just [man] will one die, for perhaps for [the] good [man] some one might also dare to die;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but God commends *his* love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Much rather therefore, having been now justified in [the power of] his blood, we shall be saved by him from wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much rather, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in [the power of] his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And not only [that], but [we are] making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we have received the reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For this [cause], even as by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death; and thus death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">(for until law sin was in [the] world; but sin is not put to account when there is no law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but death reigned from Adam until Moses, even upon those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is [the] figure of him to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But [shall] not the act of favour [be] as the offence? For if by the offence of one the many have died, much rather has the grace of God, and the free gift in grace, which [is] by the one man Jesus Christ, abounded unto the many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And [shall] not as by one that has sinned [be] the gift? For the judgment [was] of one to condemnation, but the act of favour, of many offences unto justification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For if by the offence of the one death reigned by the one, much rather shall those who receive the abundance of grace, and of the free gift of righteousness, reign in life by the one Jesus Christ:)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">so then as [it was] by one offence towards all men to condemnation, so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But law came in, in order that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded grace has overabounded,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">in order that, even as sin has reigned in [the power of] death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What then shall we say? Should we continue in sin that grace may abound?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Far be the thought. We who have died to sin, how shall we still live in it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Are you ignorant that we, as many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus, have been baptised unto his death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among [the] dead by the glory of the Father, so *we* also should walk in newness of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For if we are become identified with [him] in the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of [his] resurrection;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For he that has died is justified from sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">knowing that Christ having been raised up from among [the] dead dies no more: death has dominion over him no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For in that he has died, he has died to sin once for all; but in that he lives, he lives to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So also *ye*, reckon yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body to obey its lusts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither yield your members instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but yield yourselves to God as alive from among [the] dead, and your members instruments of righteousness to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For sin shall not have dominion over *you*, for ye are not under law but under grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What then? should we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Far be the thought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves bondmen for obedience, ye are bondmen to him whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But thanks [be] to God, that ye were bondmen of sin, but have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now, having got your freedom from sin, ye have become bondmen to righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I speak humanly on account of the weakness of your flesh. For even as ye have yielded your members in bondage to uncleanness and to lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now yield your members in bondage to righteousness unto holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For when ye were bondmen of sin ye were free from righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">What fruit therefore had ye *then* in the things of which ye are *now* ashamed? for the end of *them* [is] death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But *now*, having got your freedom from sin, and having become bondmen to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the wages of sin [is] death; but the act of favour of God, eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Are ye ignorant, brethren, (for I speak to those knowing law,) that law rules over a man as long as he lives?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the married woman is bound by law to her husband so long as he is alive; but if the husband should die, she is clear from the law of the husband:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">so then, the husband being alive, she shall be called an adulteress if she be to another man; but if the husband should die, she is free from the law, so as not to be an adulteress, though she be to another man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So that, my brethren, *ye* also have been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ, to be to another, who has been raised up from among [the] dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins, which [were] by the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit to death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but now we are clear from the law, having died in that in which we were held, so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What shall we say then? [is] the law sin? Far be the thought. But I had not known sin, unless by law: for I had not had conscience also of lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not lust;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but sin, getting a point of attack by the commandment, wrought in me every lust; for without law sin [was] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But *I* was alive without law once; but the commandment having come, sin revived, but *I* died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the commandment, which [was] for life, was found, [as] to me, itself [to be] unto death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">for sin, getting a point of attack by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So that the law indeed [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Did then that which is good become death to me? Far be the thought. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death to me by that which is good; in order that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we know that the law is spiritual: but *I* am fleshly, sold under sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For that which I do, I do not own: for not what I will, this I do; but what I hate, this I practise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if what I do not will, this I practise, I consent to the law that [it is] right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now then [it is] no longer *I* [that] do it, but the sin that dwells in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell: for to will is there with me, but to do right [I find] not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I do not practise the good that I will; but the evil I do not will, that I do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But if what *I* do not will, this I practise, [it is] no longer *I* [that] do it, but the sin that dwells in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I find then the law upon *me* who will to practise what is right, that with *me* evil is there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but I see another law in my members, warring in opposition to the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which exists in my members.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">O wretched man that I [am]! who shall deliver me out of this body of death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then *I* *myself* with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">[There is] then now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">in order that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For they that are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh; and they that are according to Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the mind of the flesh [is] death; but the mind of the Spirit life and peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God; for neither indeed can it be:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and they that are in flesh cannot please God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But *ye* are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you; but if any one has not [the] Spirit of Christ *he* is not of him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">but if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among [the] dead dwell in you, he that has raised up Christ from among [the] dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">for if ye live according to flesh, ye are about to die; but if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">for as many as are led by [the] Spirit of God, *these* are sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ's joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with [him], that we may also be glorified with [him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory to be revealed to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">for the creature has been made subject to vanity, not of its will, but by reason of him who has subjected [the same], in hope</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">that the creature itself also shall be set free from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And not only [that], but even *we* ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, we also ourselves groan in ourselves, awaiting adoption, [that is] the redemption of our body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For we have been saved in hope; but hope seen is not hope; for what any one sees, why does he also hope?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But if what we see not we hope, we expect in patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And in like manner the Spirit joins also its help to our weakness; for we do not know what we should pray for as is fitting, but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But he who searches the hearts knows what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for saints according to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But we *do* know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Because whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be [the] firstborn among many brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But whom he has predestinated, these also he has called; and whom he has called, these also he has justified; but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">What shall we then say to these things? If God [be] for us, who against us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him grant us all things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect? [It is] God who justifies:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">who is he that condemns? [It is] Christ who has died, but rather has been [also] raised up; who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">According as it is written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which [is] in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I say [the] truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in [the] Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that I have great grief and uninterrupted pain in my heart,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">for I have wished, I myself, to be a curse from the Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who are Israelites; whose [is] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the law-giving, and the service, and the promises;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">whose [are] the fathers; and of whom, as according to flesh, [is] the Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Not however as though the word of God had failed; for not all [are] Israel which [are] of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">nor because they are seed of Abraham [are] all children: but, In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That is, [they that are] the children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned as seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For this word [is] of promise, According to this time I will come, and there shall be a son to Sarah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And not only [that], but Rebecca having conceived by one, Isaac our father,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">[the children] indeed being not yet born, or having done anything good or worthless (that the purpose of God according to election might abide, not of works, but of him that calls),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">it was said to her, The greater shall serve the less:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">according as it is written, I have loved Jacob, and I have hated Esau.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God? Far be the thought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he says to Moses, I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy, and I will feel compassion for whom I will feel compassion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So then [it is] not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shews mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very thing I have raised thee up from amongst [men], that I might thus shew in thee my power, and so that my name should be declared in all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So then, to whom he will he shews mercy, and whom he will he hardens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Thou wilt say to me then, Why does he yet find fault? for who resists his purpose?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Aye, but thou, O man, who art *thou* that answerest again to God? Shall the thing formed say to him that has formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honour, and another to dishonour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And if God, minded to shew his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">us, whom he has also called, not only from amongst [the] Jews, but also from amongst [the] nations?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">As he says also in Hosea, I will call not-my-people My people; and the-not-beloved Beloved.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">But Esaias cries concerning Israel, Should the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for [he] is bringing the matter to an end, and [cutting [it] short in righteousness; because] a cutting short of the matter will [the] Lord accomplish upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And according as Esaias said before, Unless [the] Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and made like even as Gomorrha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">What then shall we say? That [they of the] nations, who did not follow after righteousness, have attained righteousness, but [the] righteousness that is on the principle of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But Israel, pursuing after a law of righteousness, has not attained to [that] law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Wherefore? Because [it was] not on the principle of faith, but as of works. They have stumbled at the stumblingstone,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">according as it is written, Behold, I place in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence: and he that believes on him shall not be ashamed.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Brethren, the delight of my own heart and my supplication which [I address] to God for them is for salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I bear them witness that they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own [righteousness], have not submitted to the righteousness of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For Christ is [the] end of law for righteousness to every one that believes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For Moses lays down in writing the righteousness which is of the law, The man who has practised those things shall live by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the righteousness of faith speaks thus: Do not say in thine heart, Who shall ascend to the heavens? that is, to bring Christ down;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">or, Who shall descend into the abyss? that is, to bring up Christ from among [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But what says it? The word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from among [the] dead, thou shalt be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For with [the] heart is believed to righteousness; and with [the] mouth confession made to salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the scripture says, No one believing on him shall be ashamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For there is no difference of Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all [is] rich towards all that call upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For every one whosoever, who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">How then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without one who preaches?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and how shall they preach unless they have been sent? according as it is written, How beautiful the feet of them that announce glad tidings of peace, of them that announce glad tidings of good things!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But they have not all obeyed the glad tidings. For Esaias says, Lord, who has believed our report?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So faith then [is] by a report, but the report by God's word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But I say, Have they not heard? Yea, surely, Their voice has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the extremities of the habitable world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I say, Has not Israel known? First, Moses says, *I* will provoke you to jealousy through [them that are] not a nation: through a nation without understanding I will anger you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Esaias is very bold, and says, I have been found by those not seeking me; I have become manifest to those not inquiring after me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But unto Israel he says, All the day long I have stretched out my hands unto a people disobeying and opposing.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I say then, Has God cast away his people? Far be the thought. For *I* also am an Israelite, of [the] seed of Abraham, of [the] tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God has not cast away his people whom he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture says in [the history of] Elias, how he pleads with God against Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have dug down thine altars; and *I* have been left alone, and they seek my life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But what says the divine answer to him? I have left to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed knee to Baal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Thus, then, in the present time also there has been a remnant according to election of grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if by grace, no longer of works: since [otherwise] grace is no more grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What [is it] then? What Israel seeks for, that he has not obtained; but the election has obtained, and the rest have been blinded,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">according as it is written, God has given to them a spirit of slumber, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear, unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David says, Let their table be for a snare, and for a gin, and for a fall-trap, and for a recompense to them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">let their eyes be darkened not to see, and bow down their back alway.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I say then, Have they stumbled in order that they might fall? Far be the thought: but by their fall [there is] salvation to the nations to provoke them to jealousy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But if their fall [be the] world's wealth, and their loss [the] wealth of [the] nations, how much rather their fulness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I speak to you, the nations, inasmuch as *I* am apostle of nations, I glorify my ministry;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">if by any means I shall provoke to jealousy [them which are] my flesh, and shall save some from among them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, as to our tribulation which happened [to us] in Asia, that we were excessively pressed beyond [our] power, so as to despair even of living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">For out of much tribulation and distress of heart I wrote to you, with many tears; not that ye may be grieved, but that ye may know the love which I have very abundantly towards you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if any one has grieved, he has grieved, not me, but in part (that I may not overcharge [you]) all of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sufficient to such a one [is] this rebuke which [has been inflicted] by the many;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">to the one an odour from death unto death, but to the others an odour from life unto life; and who [is] sufficient for these things?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">who has also made us competent, [as] ministers of [the] new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">For if the ministry of condemnation [be] glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">For all things [are] for your sakes, that the grace abounding through the many may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Wherefore we faint not; but if indeed our outward man is consumed, yet the inward is renewed day by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For our momentary [and] light affliction works for us in surpassing measure an eternal weight of glory;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">while we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen [are] for a time, but those that are not seen eternal.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">I do not speak as commanding [it], but through the zeal of others, and proving the genuineness of your love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sakes he, being rich, became poor, in order that *ye* by *his* poverty might be enriched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I give [my] opinion in this, for this is profitable for you who began before, not only to do, but also to be willing, a year ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But now also complete the doing of it; so that as [there was] the readiness to be willing, so also to complete out of what ye have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For if the readiness be there, [a man is] accepted according to what he may have, not according to what he has not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For [it is] not in order that there may be ease for others, and for you distress,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">According as it is written, He who [gathered] much had no excess, and he who [gathered] little was nothing short.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But thanks [be] to God, who gives the same diligent zeal for you in the heart of Titus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he received indeed the entreaty, but, being full of zeal, he went of his own accord to you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">but we have sent with him the brother whose praise [is] in the glad tidings through all the assemblies;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and not only [so], but [is] also chosen by the assemblies as our fellow-traveller with this grace, ministered by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and [a witness of] our readiness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">avoiding this, that any one should blame us in this abundance [which is] administered by us;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved to be of diligent zeal in many things, and now more diligently zealous through the great confidence [he has] as to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Whether as regards Titus, [he is] my companion and fellow-labourer in your behalf; or our brethren, [they are] deputed messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">For concerning the ministration which [is] for the saints, it is superfluous my writing to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I know your readiness, which I boast of as respects you to Macedonians, that Achaia is prepared since a year ago, and the zeal [reported] of you has stimulated the mass [of the brethren].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But I have sent the brethren, in order that our boasting about you may not be made void in this respect, in order that, as I have said, ye may be prepared;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">lest haply, if Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, *we*, that we say not *ye*, may be put to shame in this confidence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I thought it necessary therefore to beg the brethren that they would come to you, and complete beforehand your fore-announced blessing, that this may be ready thus as blessing, and not as got out of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But this [is true], he that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that sows in [the spirit of] blessing shall reap also in blessing:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">each according as he is purposed in his heart; not grievingly, or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But God is able to make every gracious gift abound towards you, that, having in every way always all-sufficiency, ye may abound to every good work:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">according as it is written, He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor, his righteousness remains for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now he that supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating shall supply and make abundant your sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">enriched in every way unto all free-hearted liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Because the ministration of this service is not only filling up the measure of what is lacking to the saints, but also abounding by many thanksgivings to God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">they glorifying God through the proof of this ministration, by reason of your subjection, by profession, to the glad tidings of the Christ, and your free-hearted liberality in communicating towards them and towards all;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves; but these, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not intelligent.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then after a lapse of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with [me];</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">But from those who were conspicuous as being somewhat whatsoever they were, it makes no difference to me: God does not accept man's person; for to me those who were conspicuous communicated nothing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but, on the contrary, seeing that the glad tidings of the uncircumcision were confided to me, even as to Peter that of the circumcision,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">and recognising the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were conspicuous as being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas [the] right hands of fellowship, that *we* [should go] to the nations, and *they* to the circumcision;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to [the] face, because he was to be condemned:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">for before that certain came from James, he ate with [those of] the nations; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those of [the] circumcision;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and the rest of the Jews also played the same dissembling part with him; so that even Barnabas was carried away too by their dissimulation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when I saw that they do not walk straightforwardly, according to the truth of the glad tidings, I said to Peter before all, If *thou*, being a Jew, livest as the nations and not as the Jews, how dost thou compel the nations to Judaize?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We, Jews by nature, and not sinners of [the] nations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">but knowing that a man is not justified on the principle of works of law [nor] but by the faith of Jesus Christ, *we* also have believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified on the principle of [the] faith of Christ; and not of works of law; because on the principle of works of law no flesh shall be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now if in seeking to be justified in Christ we also have been found sinners, then [is] Christ minister of sin? Far be the thought.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">For as many as are on the principle of works of law are under curse. For it is written, Cursed is every one who does not continue in all things which [are] written in the book of the law to do them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">but that by law no one is justified with God [is] evident, because The just shall live on the principle of faith;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">but the law is not on the principle of faith; but, He that shall have done these things shall live by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse for us, (for it is written, Cursed [is] every one hanged upon a tree,)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Brethren, (I speak according to man,) even man's confirmed covenant no one sets aside, or adds other dispositions to.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But to Abraham were the promises addressed, and to his seed: he does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed; which is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now I say this, A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which took place four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if the inheritance [be] on the principle of law, [it is] no longer on the principle of promise; but God gave it in grace to Abraham by promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Why then the law? It was added for the sake of transgressions, until the seed came to whom the promise was made, ordained through angels in [the] hand of a mediator.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But a mediator is not of one, but God is one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">[Is] then the law against the promises of God? Far be the thought. For if a law had been given able to quicken, then indeed righteousness were on the principle of law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">but the scripture has shut up all things under sin, that the promise, on the principle of faith of Jesus Christ, should be given to those that believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But before faith came, we were guarded under law, shut up to faith [which was] about to be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So that the law has been our tutor up to Christ, that we might be justified on the principle of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But, faith having come, we are no longer under a tutor;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For ye, as many as have been baptised unto Christ, have put on Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There is no Jew nor Greek; there is no bondman nor freeman; there is no male and female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now I say, As long as the heir is a child, he differs nothing from a bondman, though he be lord of all;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the principles of the world;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">my children, of whom I again travail in birth until Christ shall have been formed in you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and I should wish to be present with you now, and change my voice, for I am perplexed as to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Tell me, ye who are desirous of being under law, do ye not listen to the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons; one of the maid servant, and one of the free woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he [that was] of the maid servant was born according to flesh, and he [that was] of the free woman through the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Which things have an allegorical sense; for these are two covenants: one from mount Sinai, gendering to bondage, which is Hagar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which [is] now, for she is in bondage with her children;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">but the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break out and cry, thou that travailest not; because the children of the desolate are more numerous than [those] of her that has a husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But *ye*, brethren, after the pattern of Isaac, are children of promise.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">But what says the scripture? Cast out the maid servant and her son; for the son of the maid servant shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For every high priest taken from amongst men is established for men in things relating to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">being able to exercise forbearance towards the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is clothed with infirmity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and, on account of this [infirmity], he ought, even as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And no one takes the honour to himself but [as] called by God, even as Aaron also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Thus the Christ also has not glorified himself to be made a high priest; but he who had said to him, *Thou* art my Son, *I* have to-day begotten thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Even as also in another [place] he says, *Thou* [art] a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save him out of death, with strong crying and tears; (and having been heard because of his piety;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">though he were Son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and having been perfected, became to all them that obey him, author of eternal salvation;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Concerning whom we have much to say, and hard to be interpreted in speaking [of it], since ye are become dull in hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have again need that [one] should teach you what [are] the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk, [and] not of solid food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For every one that partakes of milk [is] unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but solid food belongs to full-grown men, who, on account of habit, have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us go on [to what belongs] to full growth, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">of [the] doctrine of washings, and of imposition of hands, and of resurrection of [the] dead, and of eternal judgment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and this will we do if God permit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of [the] Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and have tasted the good word of God, and [the] works of power of [the] age to come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and have fallen away, crucifying for themselves [as they do] the Son of God, and making a show of [him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it, and produces useful herbs for those for whose sakes also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things, and connected with salvation, even if we speak thus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work, and the love which ye have shewn to his name, having ministered to the saints, and [still] ministering.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience have been inheritors of the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For God, having promised to Abraham, since he had no greater to swear by, swore by himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and thus, having had long patience, he got the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For men indeed swear by a greater, and with them the oath is a term to all dispute, as making matters sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Wherein God, willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that by two unchangeable things, in which [it was] impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from smiting the kings, and blessed him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to whom Abraham gave also the tenth portion of all; first being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now consider how great this [personage] was, to whom [even] the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they indeed from among the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is from their brethren, though these are come out of the loins of Abraham:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but he who has no genealogy from them has tithed Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But beyond all gainsaying, the inferior is blessed by the better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And here dying men receive tithes; but there [one] of whom the witness is that he lives;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, who received tithes, has been made to pay tithes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If indeed then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for the people had their law given to them in connexion with *it*, what need [was there] still that a different priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be named after the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For, the priesthood being changed, there takes place of necessity a change of law also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For he, of whom these things are said, belongs to a different tribe, of which no one has [ever] been attached to the service of the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is clear that our Lord has sprung out of Juda, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing as to priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it is yet more abundantly evident, since a different priest arises according to the similitude of Melchisedec,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who has been constituted not according to law of fleshly commandment, but according to power of indissoluble life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For it is borne witness, *Thou* art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there is a setting aside of the commandment going before for its weakness and unprofitableness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(for the law perfected nothing,) and the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And by how much [it was] not without the swearing of an oath;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(for they are become priests without the swearing of an oath, but he with the swearing of an oath, by him who said, as to him, The Lord has sworn, and will not repent [of it], *Thou* [art] priest for ever [according to the order of Melchisedec];)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">by so much Jesus became surety of a better covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they have been many priests, on account of being hindered from continuing by death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but he, because of his continuing for ever, has the priesthood unchangeable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Whence also he is able to save completely those who approach by him to God, always living to intercede for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">who has not day by day need, as the high priests, first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins, then [for] those of the people; for this he did once for all [in] having offered up himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the law constitutes men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the swearing of the oath which [is] after the law, a Son perfected for ever.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now a summary of the things of which we are speaking [is], We have such a one high priest who has sat down on [the] right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, [and] not man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For every high priest is constituted for the offering both of gifts and sacrifices; whence it is needful that this one also should have something which he may offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If then indeed he were upon earth, he would not even be a priest, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">(who serve the representation and shadow of heavenly things, according as Moses was oracularly told [when] about to make the tabernacle; for See, saith He, that thou make all things according to the pattern which has been shewn to thee in the mountain.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now he has got a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is mediator of a better covenant, which is established on the footing of better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if that first was faultless, place had not been sought for a second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For finding fault, he says to them, Behold, days come, saith the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant as regards the house of Israel, and as regards the house of Juda;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers in [the] day of my taking their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because *they* did not continue in my covenant, and *I* did not regard them, saith [the] Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Because this [is] the covenant that I will covenant to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: Giving my laws into their mind, I will write them also upon their hearts; and I will be to them for God, and *they* shall be to me for people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they shall not teach each his fellow-citizen, and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; because all shall know me in themselves, from [the] little one [among them] unto [the] great among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Because I will be merciful to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In that he says New, he has made the first old; but that which grows old and aged [is] near disappearing.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The first therefore also indeed had ordinances of service, and the sanctuary, a worldly one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For a tabernacle was set up; the first, in which [were] both the candlestick and the table and the exposition of the loaves, which is called Holy;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but after the second veil a tabernacle which is called Holy of holies,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, covered round in every part with gold, in which [were] the golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tables of the covenant;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and above over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat; concerning which it is not now [the time] to speak in detail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times, accomplishing the services;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but into the second, the high priest only, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">the Holy Spirit shewing this, that the way of the [holy of] holies has not yet been made manifest while as yet the first tabernacle has [its] standing;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">nor by blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, has entered in once for all into the [holy of] holies, having found an eternal redemption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of goats and bulls, and a heifer's ashes sprinkling the defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">how much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship [the] living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And for this reason he is mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">(For where [there is] a testament, the death of the testator must needs come in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For a testament [is] of force when men are dead, since it is in no way of force while the testator is alive.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whence neither the first was inaugurated without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For every commandment having been spoken according to [the] law by Moses to all the people; having taken the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, This [is] the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the tabernacle too and all the vessels of service he sprinkled in like manner with blood;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">[It was] necessary then that the figurative representations of the things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices better than these.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">nor in order that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with blood not his own;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">since he had [then] been obliged often to suffer from the foundation of the world. But now once in the consummation of the ages he has been manifested for [the] putting away of sin by his sacrifice.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For the law, having a shadow of the coming good things, not the image itself of the things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually yearly, perfect those who approach.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But in these [there is] a calling to mind of sins yearly.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">My children, these things I write to you in order that ye may not sin; and if any one sin, we have a patron with the Father, Jesus Christ [the] righteous;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and *he* is the propitiation for our sins; but not for ours alone, but also for the whole world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He that says, I know him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but whoever keeps his word, in him verily the love of God is perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He that says he abides in him ought, even as *he* walked, himself also [so] to walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light already shines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in the darkness until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He that loves his brother abides in light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But he that hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and knows not where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I write to you, children, because [your] sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked [one]. I write to you, little children, because ye have known the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have written to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked [one].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">because all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the world is passing, and its lust, but he that does the will of God abides for eternity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Little children, it is [the] last hour, and, according as ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have come many antichrists, whence we know that it is [the] last hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They went out from among us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have surely remained with us, but that they might be made manifest that none are of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And *ye* have [the] unction from the holy [one], and ye know all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I have not written to you because ye do not know the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? *He* is the antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Whoever denies the Son has not the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">As for *you* let that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you: if what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you, *ye* also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And this is the promise which *he* has promised us, life eternal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">These things have I written to you concerning those who lead you astray:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and *yourselves*, the unction which ye have received from him abides in you, and ye have not need that any one should teach you; but as the same unction teaches you as to all things, and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, ye shall abide in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And now, children, abide in him, that if he be manifested we may have boldness, and not be put to shame from before him at his coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">If ye know that he is righteous, know that every one who practises righteousness is begotten of him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called [the] children of God. For this reason the world knows us not, because it knew him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Beloved, now are we children of God, and what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as *he* is pure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Every one that practises sin practises also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And ye know that *he* has been manifested that he might take away our sins; and in him sin is not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Whoever abides in him, does not sin: whoever sins, has not seen him or known him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Children, let no man lead you astray; he that practises righteousness is righteous, even as *he* is righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He that practises sin is of the devil; for from [the] beginning the devil sins. To this end the Son of God has been manifested, that he might undo the works of the devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Whoever has been begotten of God does not practise sin, because his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In this are manifest the children of God and the children of the devil. Whoever does not practise righteousness is not of God, and he who does not love his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For this is the message which ye have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">not as Cain was of the wicked one, and slew his brother; and on account of what slew he him? because his works were wicked, and those of his brother righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Do not wonder, brethren, if the world hate you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">*We* know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love [his] brother abides in death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Every one that hates his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Hereby we have known love, because *he* has laid down his life for us; and *we* ought for the brethren to lay down [our] lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But whoso may have the world's substance, and see his brother having need, and shut up his bowels from him, how abides the love of God in him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Children, let us not love with word, nor with tongue, but in deed and in truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And hereby we shall know that we are of the truth, and shall persuade our hearts before him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">that if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness towards God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and whatsoever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments, and practise the things which are pleasing in his sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And this is his commandment, that we believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and that we love one another, even as he has given us commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he that keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given to us.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, if they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Hereby ye know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh is of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and every spirit which does not confess Jesus Christ come in flesh is not of God: and this is that [power] of the antichrist, [of] which ye have heard that it comes, and now it is already in the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">*Ye* are of God, children, and have overcome them, because greater is he that [is] in you than he that [is] in the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">*They* are of the world; for this reason they speak [as] of the world, and the world hears them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">*We* are of God; he that knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Beloved, let us love one another; because love is of God, and every one that loves has been begotten of God, and knows God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He that loves not has not known God; for God is love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Beloved, if God has so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">No one has seen God at any time: if we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, that he has given to us of his Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And *we* have seen, and testify, that the Father has sent the Son [as] Saviour of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And *we* have known and have believed the love which God has to us. God is love, and he that abides in love abides in God, and God in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Herein has love been perfected with us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, that even as *he* is, *we* also are in this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear has torment, and he that fears has not been made perfect in love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">*We* love because *he* has first loved us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">If any one say, I love God, and hate his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And this commandment have we from him, That he that loves God love also his brother.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Every one that believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God; and every one that loves him that has begotten loves also him that is begotten of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Hereby know we that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For all that has been begotten of God gets the victory over the world; and this is the victory which has gotten the victory over the world, our faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus [the] Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For they that bear witness are three:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three agree in one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God [which] he has witnessed concerning his Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself; he that does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the witness which God has witnessed concerning his Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And this is the witness, that God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He that has the Son has life: he that has not the Son of God has not life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These things have I written to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life who believe on the name of the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And this is the boldness which we have towards him, that if we ask him anything according to his will he hears us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And if we know that he hears us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, for those that do not sin unto death. There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Every unrighteousness is sin; and there is a sin not to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">We know that every one begotten of God does not sin, but he that has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked [one] does not touch him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked [one].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that [is] true; and we are in him that [is] true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.</VERS>
