<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning-the first day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">And God said, "Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">God called the expanse "sky." And there was evening, and there was morning-the second day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">God called the dry ground "land," and the gathered waters he called "seas." And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds." And it was so.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And there was evening, and there was morning-the third day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth." And it was so.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">God made two great lights-the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">And there was evening, and there was morning-the fourth day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And God said, "Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">And there was evening, and there was morning-the fifth day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">And God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind." And it was so.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground-everything that has the breath of life in it-I give every green plant for food." And it was so.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning-the sixth day.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created. When the LORD God made the earth and the heavens-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to work the ground,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground-trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">(The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">And the LORD God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman, 'for she was taken out of man."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"You will not surely die," the serpent said to the woman.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But the LORD God called to the man, "Where are you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He answered, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">And he said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The man said, "The woman you put here with me-she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So the LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, "Cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">To the woman he said, "I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,'"Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">And the LORD God said, "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">Adam lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, "With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?I don't know," he replied. "Am I my brother's keeper?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The LORD said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is more than I can bear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But the LORD said to him, "Not so; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So Cain went out from the LORD's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Adam lay with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on the name of the LORD.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">This is the written account of Adam's line. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He created them male and female and blessed them. And when they were created, he called them "man. "</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Altogether, Adam lived 930 years, and then he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father of Enosh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And after he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Altogether, Seth lived 912 years, and then he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">When Enosh had lived 90 years, he became the father of Kenan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And after he became the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Altogether, Enosh lived 905 years, and then he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When Kenan had lived 70 years, he became the father of Mahalalel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And after he became the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Altogether, Kenan lived 910 years, and then he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he became the father of Jared.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">And after he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Altogether, Mahalalel lived 895 years, and then he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">And after he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Altogether, Jared lived 962 years, and then he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">And after he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Altogether, Enoch lived 365 years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became the father of Lamech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">And after he became the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Altogether, Methuselah lived 969 years, and then he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">He named him Noah and said, "He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the LORD has cursed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Altogether, Lamech lived 777 years, and then he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then the LORD said, "My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The Nephilim were on the earth in those days-and also afterward-when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The LORD saw how great man's wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So the LORD said, "I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth-men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air-for I am grieved that I have made them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked with God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Make a roof for it and finish the ark to within 18 inches of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark-you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Noah did everything just as God commanded him.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD then said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Take with you seven of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and two of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and also seven of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">And Noah did all that the LORD commanded him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, on the seventeenth day of the second month-on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD shut him in.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet.,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Every living thing that moved on the earth perished-birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; men and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds of the air were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">After forty days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But the dove could find no place to set its feet because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">By the first day of the first month of Noah's six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then God said to Noah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you-the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground-so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds-everything that moves on the earth-came out of the ark, one kind after another.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: "Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The fear and dread of you will fall upon all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air, upon every creature that moves along the ground, and upon all the fish of the sea; they are given into your hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Everything that lives and moves will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each man, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of his fellow man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">and with every living creature that was with you-the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you-every living creature on earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father's nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father's nakedness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">he said, "Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He also said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">May God extend the territory of Japheth; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be his slave."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">After the flood Noah lived 350 years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Altogether, Noah lived 950 years, and then he died.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">This is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah's sons, who themselves had sons after the flood. The Japhethites</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittim and the Rodanim.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="6">The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put and Canaan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Cush was the father of Nimrod, who grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; that is why it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Erech, Akkad and Calneh, in Shinar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="20">These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations. The Semites</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah the father of Eber.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Obal, Abimael, Sheba,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="30">The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">These are the clans of Noah's sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">As men moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">They said to each other, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly." They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The LORD said, "If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">That is why it was called Babel -because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">This is the account of Shem. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of Arphaxad.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">And after he became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="24">When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">After Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">This is the account of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, in the land of his birth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milcah and Iscah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Now Sarai was barren; she had no children.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Haran, they settled there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Haran.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD had said to Abram, "Leave your country, your people and your father's household and go to the land I will show you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So Abram left, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Haran.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The LORD appeared to Abram and said, "To your offspring I will give this land." So he built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the LORD and called on the name of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "I know what a beautiful woman you are.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife.' Then they will kill me but will let you live.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that she was a very beautiful woman.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And when Pharaoh's officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, menservants and maidservants, and camels.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But the LORD inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram's wife Sarai.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">So Pharaoh summoned Abram. "What have you done to me?" he said. "Why didn't you tell me she was your wife?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
<VERS vnumber="1">So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And quarreling arose between Abram's herdsmen and the herdsmen of Lot. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So Abram said to Lot, "Let's not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herdsmen and mine, for we are brothers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Is not the whole land before you? Let's part company. If you go to the left, I'll go to the right; if you go to the right, I'll go to the left."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered, like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, toward Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Now the men of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The LORD said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, "Lift up your eyes from where you are and look north and south, east and west.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">So Abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the LORD.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
<VERS vnumber="1">At this time Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (the Salt Sea ).</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazazon Tamar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar-four kings against five.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They also carried off Abram's nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">One who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshcol and Aner, all of whom were allied with Abram.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">During the night Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">and he blessed Abram, saying, "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And blessed be God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand." Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have raised my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, and have taken an oath</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the thong of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, 'I made Abram rich.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me-to Aner, Eshcol and Mamre. Let them have their share."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
<VERS vnumber="1">After this, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: "Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward. "</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">But Abram said, "O Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">And Abram said, "You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the word of the LORD came to him: "This man will not be your heir, but a son coming from your own body will be your heir."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He took him outside and said, "Look up at the heavens and count the stars-if indeed you can count them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring be."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He also said to him, "I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But Abram said, "O Sovereign LORD, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So the LORD said to him, "Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then the LORD said to him, "Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram and said, "To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">so she said to Abram, "The LORD has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family through her." Abram agreed to what Sarai said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then Sarai said to Abram, "You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the LORD judge between you and me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Your servant is in your hands," Abram said. "Do with her whatever you think best." Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The angel of the LORD found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And he said, "Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?I'm running away from my mistress Sarai," she answered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then the angel of the LORD told her, "Go back to your mistress and submit to her."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The angel added, "I will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The angel of the LORD also said to her: "You are now with child and you will have a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the LORD has heard of your misery.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone's hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">She gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her: "You are the God who sees me," for she said, "I have now seen the One who sees me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am God Almighty; walk before me and be blameless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I will confirm my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Abram fell facedown, and God said to him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">No longer will you be called Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The whole land of Canaan, where you are now an alien, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then God said to Abraham, "As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner-those who are not your offspring.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">God also said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, "Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And Abraham said to God, "If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then God said, "Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">and his son Ishmael was thirteen;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that same day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">And every male in Abraham's household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He said, "If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, do not pass your servant by.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way-now that you have come to your servant.Very well," they answered, "do as you say."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. "Quick," he said, "get three seahs of fine flour and knead it and bake some bread."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Where is your wife Sarah?" they asked him. "There, in the tent," he said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then the LORD said, "I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son." Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Abraham and Sarah were already old and well advanced in years, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, "After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then the LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Is anything too hard for the LORD? I will return to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, "I did not laugh." But he said, "Yes, you did laugh."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then the LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, so that the LORD will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then the LORD said, "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then Abraham approached him and said: "Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Far be it from you to do such a thing-to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The LORD said, "If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then Abraham spoke up again: "Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city because of five people?If I find forty-five there," he said, "I will not destroy it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Once again he spoke to him, "What if only forty are found there?" He said, "For the sake of forty, I will not do it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then he said, "May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?" He answered, "I will not do it if I find thirty there."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Abraham said, "Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?" He said, "For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Then he said, "May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?" He answered, "For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">When the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
<VERS vnumber="1">The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"My lords," he said, "please turn aside to your servant's house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.No," they answered, "we will spend the night in the square."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-both young and old-surrounded the house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">and said, "No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Get out of our way," they replied. And they said, "This fellow came here as an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse than them." They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The two men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here-sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, "Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, "Flee for your lives! Don't look back, and don't stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But Lot said to them, "No, my lords, please!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can't flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I'll die.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it-it is very small, isn't it? Then my life will be spared."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He said to him, "Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it." (That is why the town was called Zoar. )</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah-from the LORD out of the heavens.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities-and also the vegetation in the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">One day the older daughter said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all over the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Let's get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">The next day the older daughter said to the younger, "Last night I lay with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites of today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But God came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Did he not say to me, 'She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, 'He is my brother'? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all yours will die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Early the next morning Abimelech summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then Abimelech called Abraham in and said, "What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And Abimelech asked Abraham, "What was your reason for doing this?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Abraham replied, "I said to myself, 'There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And when God had me wander from my father's household, I said to her, 'This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then Abimelech brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And Abimelech said, "My land is before you; live wherever you like."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">To Sarah he said, "I am giving your brother a thousand shekels of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife and his slave girls so they could have children again,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">for the LORD had closed up every womb in Abimelech's household because of Abraham's wife Sarah.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now the LORD was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what he had promised.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Sarah said, "God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And she added, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">and she said to Abraham, "Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But God said to him, "Do not be so distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I will make the son of the maidservant into a nation also, because he is your offspring."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the desert of Beersheba.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then she went off and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she thought, "I cannot watch the boy die." And as she sat there nearby, she began to sob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, "God is with you in everything you do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you are living as an alien the same kindness I have shown to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Abraham said, "I swear it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">But Abimelech said, "I don't know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a treaty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">and Abimelech asked Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">He replied, "Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">So that place was called Beersheba, because the two men swore an oath there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of the LORD, the Eternal God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
<VERS vnumber="1">Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!Here I am," he replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then God said, "Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Early the next morning Abraham got up and saddled his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He said to his servants, "Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, "Father?Yes, my son?" Abraham replied. "The fire and wood are here," Isaac said, "but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Abraham answered, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And the two of them went on together.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!Here I am," he replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"Do not lay a hand on the boy," he said. "Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide. And to this day it is said, "On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">and said, "I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Some time later Abraham was told, "Milcah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram),</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight sons to Abraham's brother Nahor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maacah.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
<VERS vnumber="1">Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites. He said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"I am an alien and a stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The Hittites replied to Abraham,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He said to them, "If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"No, my lord," he said. "Listen to me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">and he said to Ephron in their hearing, "Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Ephron answered Abraham,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver, but what is that between me and you? Bury your dead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Abraham agreed to Ephron's terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So Ephron's field in Machpelah near Mamre-both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field-was deeded</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
<VERS vnumber="1">Abraham was now old and well advanced in years, and the LORD had blessed him in every way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He said to the chief servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I want you to swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The servant asked him, "What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Make sure that you do not take my son back there," Abraham said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father's household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, 'To your offspring I will give this land'-he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and left, taking with him all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then he prayed, "O LORD, God of my master Abraham, give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">May it be that when I say to a girl, 'Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,' and she says, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too'-let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The girl was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever lain with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The servant hurried to meet her and said, "Please give me a little water from your jar."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"Drink, my lord," she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">After she had given him a drink, she said, "I'll draw water for your camels too, until they have finished drinking."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then he asked, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">She answered him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">And she added, "We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">saying, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master's relatives."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">The girl ran and told her mother's household about these things.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">"Come, you who are blessed by the LORD," he said. "Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Then food was set before him, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.Then tell us," Laban said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">So he said, "I am Abraham's servant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">The LORD has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, menservants and maidservants, and camels and donkeys.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">My master's wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">And my master made me swear an oath, and said, 'You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">but go to my father's family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">"Then I asked my master, 'What if the woman will not come back with me?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">"He replied, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father's family.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Then, when you go to my clan, you will be released from my oath even if they refuse to give her to you-you will be released from my oath.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">"When I came to the spring today, I said, 'O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">See, I am standing beside this spring; if a maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar,"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">and if she says to me, "Drink, and I'll draw water for your camels too," let her be the one the LORD has chosen for my master's son.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">"Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">"She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too.' So I drank, and she watered the camels also.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">"I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?'"She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.'"Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">and I bowed down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master's brother for his son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">Laban and Bethuel answered, "This is from the LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has directed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="52">When Abraham's servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="53">Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="54">Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, "Send me on my way to my master."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="55">But her brother and her mother replied, "Let the girl remain with us ten days or so; then you may go."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="56">But he said to them, "Do not detain me, now that the LORD has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="57">Then they said, "Let's call the girl and ask her about it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="58">So they called Rebekah and asked her, "Will you go with this man?I will go," she said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="59">So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="60">And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the gates of their enemies."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="61">Then Rebekah and her maids got ready and mounted their camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="62">Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="63">He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="64">Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="65">and asked the servant, "Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?He is my master," the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="66">Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="67">Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
<VERS vnumber="1">Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites and the Leummites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Altogether, Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">After Abraham's death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">This is the account of Abraham's son Ishmael, whom Sarah's maidservant, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Altogether, Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the border of Egypt, as you go toward Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">This is the account of Abraham's son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. The LORD answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, "Why is this happening to me?" So she went to inquire of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was a quiet man, staying among the tents.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">He said to Jacob, "Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I'm famished!" (That is why he was also called Edom. )</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Jacob replied, "First sell me your birthright."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">"Look, I am about to die," Esau said. "What good is the birthright to me?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">But Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a famine in the land-besides the earlier famine of Abraham's time-and Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines in Gerar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land where I tell you to live.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">because Abraham obeyed me and kept my requirements, my commands, my decrees and my laws."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So Isaac stayed in Gerar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," because he was afraid to say, "She is my wife." He thought, "The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, "She is really your wife! Why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac answered him, "Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So Abimelech gave orders to all the people: "Anyone who molests this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the LORD blessed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then Abimelech said to Isaac, "Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Isaac's servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen and said, "The water is ours!" So he named the well Esek, because they disputed with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth, saying, "Now the LORD has given us room and we will flourish in the land."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">From there he went up to Beersheba.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">That night the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Meanwhile, Abimelech had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Isaac asked them, "Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">They answered, "We saw clearly that the LORD was with you; so we said, 'There ought to be a sworn agreement between us'-between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">that you will do us no harm, just as we did not molest you but always treated you well and sent you away in peace. And now you are blessed by the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left him in peace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">That day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, "We've found water!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">He called it Shibah, and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="27">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, "My son.Here I am," he answered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Isaac said, "I am now an old man and don't know the day of my death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now then, get your weapons-your quiver and bow-and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">'Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the LORD before I die.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "But my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I'm a man with smooth skin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">His mother said to him, "My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He went to his father and said, "My father.Yes, my son," he answered. "Who is it?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your blessing."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Isaac asked his son, "How did you find it so quickly, my son?The LORD your God gave me success," he replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"Are you really my son Esau?" he asked. "I am," he replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then he said, "My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing." Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come here, my son, and kiss me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, "Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">May God give you of heaven's dew and of earth's richness- an abundance of grain and new wine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">After Isaac finished blessing him and Jacob had scarcely left his father's presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, "My father, sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">His father Isaac asked him, "Who are you?I am your son," he answered, "your firstborn, Esau."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Isaac trembled violently and said, "Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him-and indeed he will be blessed!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">When Esau heard his father's words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me-me too, my father!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">But he said, "Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Esau said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob? He has deceived me these two times: He took my birthright, and now he's taken my blessing!" Then he asked, "Haven't you reserved any blessing for me?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Isaac answered Esau, "I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Esau said to his father, "Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!" Then Esau wept aloud.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">His father Isaac answered him, "Your dwelling will be away from the earth's richness, away from the dew of heaven above.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, "Your brother Esau is consoling himself with the thought of killing you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">Stay with him for a while until your brother's fury subsides.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I'll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I'm disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="28">
<VERS vnumber="1">So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him and commanded him: "Do not marry a Canaanite woman.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Go at once to Paddan Aram, to the house of your mother's father Bethuel. Take a wife for yourself there, from among the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now live as an alien, the land God gave to Abraham."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, "Do not marry a Canaanite woman,"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">There above it stood the LORD, and he said: "I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was not aware of it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He called that place Bethel, though the city used to be called Luz.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">so that I return safely to my father's house, then the LORD will be my God</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">and this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God's house, and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="29">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">There he saw a well in the field, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. The stone over the mouth of the well was large.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well's mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Jacob asked the shepherds, "My brothers, where are you from?We're from Haran," they replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He said to them, "Do you know Laban, Nahor's grandson?Yes, we know him," they answered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then Jacob asked them, "Is he well?Yes, he is," they said, "and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Look," he said, "the sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"We can't," they replied, "until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and Laban's sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle's sheep.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then Laban said to him, "You are my own flesh and blood." After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Laban said to him, "Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was lovely in form, and beautiful.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, "I'll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Laban said, "It's better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to lie with her."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and Jacob lay with her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah to his daughter as her maidservant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn't I? Why have you deceived me?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Laban replied, "It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Finish this daughter's bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Laban gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Jacob lay with Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">When the LORD saw that Leah was not loved, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, "It is because the LORD has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, "Because the LORD heard that I am not loved, he gave me this one too." So she named him Simeon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, "Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons." So he was named Levi.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, "This time I will praise the LORD." So she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="30">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she became jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, "Give me children, or I'll die!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Jacob became angry with her and said, "Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then she said, "Here is Bilhah, my maidservant. Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and that through her I too can build a family."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">and she became pregnant and bore him a son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then Rachel said, "God has vindicated me; he has listened to my plea and given me a son." Because of this she named him Dan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then Rachel said, "I have had a great struggle with my sister, and I have won." So she named him Naphtali.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her maidservant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then Leah said, "What good fortune!" So she named him Gad.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then Leah said, "How happy I am! The women will call me happy." So she named him Asher.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">During wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants, which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But she said to her, "Wasn't it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my son's mandrakes too?Very well," Rachel said, "he can sleep with you tonight in return for your son's mandrakes."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. "You must sleep with me," she said. "I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he slept with her that night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then Leah said, "God has rewarded me for giving my maidservant to my husband." So she named him Issachar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then Leah said, "God has presented me with a precious gift. This time my husband will treat me with honor, because I have borne him six sons." So she named him Zebulun.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Some time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then God remembered Rachel; he listened to her and opened her womb.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said, "God has taken away my disgrace."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">She named him Joseph, and said, "May the LORD add to me another son."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me on my way so I can go back to my own homeland.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you, and I will be on my way. You know how much work I've done for you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">But Laban said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">He added, "Name your wages, and I will pay them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Jacob said to him, "You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">"What shall I give you?" he asked. "Don't give me anything," Jacob replied. "But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">"Agreed," said Laban. "Let it be as you have said."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban's flocks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban's animals.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="31">
<VERS vnumber="1">Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying, "Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And Jacob noticed that Laban's attitude toward him was not what it had been.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He said to them, "I see that your father's attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">You know that I've worked for your father with all my strength,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">If he said, 'The speckled ones will be your wages,' then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, 'The streaked ones will be your wages,' then all the flocks bore streaked young.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So God has taken away your father's livestock and has given them to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob.' I answered, 'Here I am.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">And he said, 'Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then Rachel and Leah replied, "Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father's estate?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father's household gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So he fled with all he had, and crossing the River, he headed for the hill country of Gilead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, "Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done? You've deceived me, and you've carried off my daughters like captives in war.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn't you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of tambourines and harps?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">You didn't even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters good-by. You have done a foolish thing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, 'Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father's house. But why did you steal my gods?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Jacob answered Laban, "I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">But if you find anyone who has your gods, he shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two maidservants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah's tent, he entered Rachel's tent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel's saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period." So he searched but could not find the household gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. "What is my crime?" he asked Laban. "What sin have I committed that you hunt me down?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">"I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">Laban answered Jacob, "The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">Come now, let's make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">He said to his relatives, "Gather some stones." So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." That is why it was called Galeed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">It was also called Mizpah, because he said, "May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">Laban also said to Jacob, "Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="52">This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="53">May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="54">He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="55">Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="32">
<VERS vnumber="1">Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">When Jacob saw them, he said, "This is the camp of God!" So he named that place Mahanaim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He instructed them: "This is what you are to say to my master Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, menservants and maidservants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, "We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, and the flocks and herds and camels as well.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He thought, "If Esau comes and attacks one group, the group that is left may escape."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, 'Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two groups.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But you have said, 'I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He instructed the one in the lead: "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">then you are to say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: "You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And be sure to say, 'Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.'" For he thought, "I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then the man said, "Let me go, for it is daybreak." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The man asked him, "What is your name?Jacob," he answered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Jacob said, "Please tell me your name." But he replied, "Why do you ask my name?" Then he blessed him there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, "It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob's hip was touched near the tendon.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="33">
<VERS vnumber="1">Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two maidservants.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. "Who are these with you?" he asked. Jacob answered, "They are the children God has graciously given your servant."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Esau asked, "What do you mean by all these droves I met?To find favor in your eyes, my lord," he said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But Esau said, "I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"No, please!" said Jacob. "If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need." And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then Esau said, "Let us be on our way; I'll accompany you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the droves before me and that of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Esau said, "Then let me leave some of my men with you.But why do that?" Jacob asked. "Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Jacob, however, went to Succoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Succoth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">For a hundred pieces of silver, he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="34">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and violated her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And Shechem said to his father Hamor, "Get me this girl as my wife."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he kept quiet about it until they came home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then Shechem's father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now Jacob's sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were filled with grief and fury, because Shechem had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter-a thing that should not be done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But Hamor said to them, "My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">You can settle among us; the land is open to you. Live in it, trade in it, and acquire property in it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then Shechem said to Dinah's father and brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I'll pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the girl as my wife."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob's sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They said to them, "We can't do such a thing; we can't give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">We will give our consent to you on one condition only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We'll settle among you and become one people with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we'll take our sister and go."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The young man, who was the most honored of all his father's household, lost no time in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob's daughter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to their fellow townsmen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"These men are friendly toward us," they said. "Let them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But the men will consent to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Won't their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us give our consent to them, and they will settle among us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem's house and left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where their sister had been defiled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">But they replied, "Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="35">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then God said to Jacob, "Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then they set out, and the terror of God fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel, because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Now Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel. So it was named Allon Bacuth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">God said to him, "Your name is Jacob, but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel. "So he named him Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">And God said to him, "I am God Almighty; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will come from your body.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, "Don't be afraid, for you have another son."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">As she breathed her last-for she was dying-she named her son Ben-Oni. But his father named him Benjamin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel's tomb.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father's concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it. Jacob had twelve sons:</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="37">
<VERS vnumber="1">Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">This is the account of Jacob. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made a richly ornamented robe for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He said to them, "Listen to this dream I had:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">His brothers said to him, "Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?" And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. "Listen," he said, "I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, "What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Now his brothers had gone to graze their father's flocks near Shechem,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">and Israel said to Joseph, "As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.Very well," he replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So he said to him, "Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me." Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, "What are you looking for?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He replied, "I'm looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"They have moved on from here," the man answered. "I heard them say, 'Let's go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Here comes that dreamer!" they said to each other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"Come now, let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we'll see what comes of his dreams."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. "Let's not take his life," he said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"Don't shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the desert, but don't lay a hand on him." Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe-the richly ornamented robe he was wearing-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">and they took him and threw him into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Judah said to his brothers, "What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood." His brothers agreed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">He went back to his brothers and said, "The boy isn't there! Where can I turn now?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Then they got Joseph's robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">They took the ornamented robe back to their father and said, "We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son's robe."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">He recognized it and said, "It is my son's robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. "No," he said, "in mourning will I go down to the grave to my son." So his father wept for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="38">
<VERS vnumber="1">At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and lay with her;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the LORD's sight; so the LORD put him to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then Judah said to Onan, "Lie with your brother's wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to produce offspring for your brother."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">What he did was wicked in the LORD's sight; so he put him to death also.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Live as a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up." For he thought, "He may die too, just like his brothers." So Tamar went to live in her father's house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">After a long time Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">When Tamar was told, "Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep,"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">she took off her widow's clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, "Come now, let me sleep with you.And what will you give me to sleep with you?" she asked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"I'll send you a young goat from my flock," he said. "Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?" she asked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He said, "What pledge should I give you?Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand," she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow's clothes again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He asked the men who lived there, "Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here," they said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So he went back to Judah and said, "I didn't find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, 'There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then Judah said, "Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn't find her."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">About three months later Judah was told, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant." Judah said, "Bring her out and have her burned to death!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. "I am pregnant by the man who owns these," she said. And she added, "See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Judah recognized them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn't give her to my son Shelah." And he did not sleep with her again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, "This one came out first."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, "So this is how you have broken out!" And he was named Perez.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out and he was given the name Zerah.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="39">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The LORD was with Joseph and he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD gave him success in everything he did,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the LORD blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the LORD was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So he left in Joseph's care everything he had; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">and after a while his master's wife took notice of Joseph and said, "Come to bed with me!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But he refused. "With me in charge," he told her, "my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">She caught him by his cloak and said, "Come to bed with me!" But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">she called her household servants. "Look," she said to them, "this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then she told him this story: "That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, "This is how your slave treated me," he burned with anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">the LORD was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care, because the LORD was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="40">
<VERS vnumber="1">Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them. After they had been in custody for some time,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">each of the two men-the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison-had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So he asked Pharaoh's officials who were in custody with him in his master's house, "Why are your faces so sad today?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"We both had dreams," they answered, "but there is no one to interpret them." Then Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, "In my dream I saw a vine in front of me,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup and put the cup in his hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"This is what it means," Joseph said to him. "The three branches are three days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh's cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">For I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, "I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"This is what it means," Joseph said. "The three baskets are three days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat away your flesh."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Now the third day was Pharaoh's birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh's hand,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">but he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="41">
<VERS vnumber="1">When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted-thin and scorched by the east wind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, "Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged. "</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"I cannot do it," Joseph replied to Pharaoh, "but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">After them, seven other cows came up-scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"In my dreams I also saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">After them, seven other heads sprouted-withered and thin and scorched by the east wind.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">"It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">"And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">So Pharaoh asked them, "Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph's finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, and men shouted before him, "Make way!" Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh's presence and traveled throughout Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said, "It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="52">The second son he named Ephraim and said, "It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="53">The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="54">and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="55">When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph and do what he tells you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="56">When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="57">And all the countries came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the world.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="42">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why do you just keep looking at each other?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He continued, "I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So Israel's sons were among those who went to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan also.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the one who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph's brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. "Where do you come from?" he asked. "From the land of Canaan," they replied, "to buy food."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"No, my lord," they answered. "Your servants have come to buy food.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"No!" he said to them. "You have come to see where our land is unprotected."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But they replied, "Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Joseph said to them, "It is just as I told you: You are spies!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">And he put them all in custody for three days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">On the third day, Joseph said to them, "Do this and you will live, for I fear God:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die." This they proceeded to do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">They said to one another, "Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that's why this distress has come upon us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Reuben replied, "Didn't I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn't listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">He turned away from them and began to weep, but then turned back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man's silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">"My silver has been returned," he said to his brothers. "Here it is in my sack." Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said, "What is this that God has done to us?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">"The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we are not spies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">"Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, 'This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man's sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Their father Jacob said to them, "You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Then Reuben said to his father, "You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">But Jacob said, "My son will not go down there with you; his brother is dead and he is the only one left. If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="43">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now the famine was still severe in the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go back and buy us a little more food."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But Judah said to him, "The man warned us solemnly, 'You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">If you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, 'You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Israel asked, "Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They replied, "The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. 'Is your father still living?' he asked us. 'Do you have another brother?' We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, 'Bring your brother down here'?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then Judah said to Israel his father, "Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift-a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Take your brother also and go back to the man at once.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">And may God Almighty grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare dinner; they are to eat with me at noon."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph's house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house. They thought, "We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">So they went up to Joseph's steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"Please, sir," they said, "we came down here the first time to buy food.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver-the exact weight-in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don't know who put our silver in our sacks."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"It's all right," he said. "Don't be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your silver." Then he brought Simeon out to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The steward took the men into Joseph's house, gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">They prepared their gifts for Joseph's arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">He asked them how they were, and then he said, "How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">They replied, "Your servant our father is still alive and well." And they bowed low to pay him honor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother's son, he asked, "Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?" And he said, "God be gracious to you, my son."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, "Serve the food."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">When portions were served to them from Joseph's table, Benjamin's portion was five times as much as anyone else's. So they feasted and drank freely with him.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="44">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house: "Fill the men's sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man's silver in the mouth of his sack.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one's sack, along with the silver for his grain." And he did as Joseph said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">As morning dawned, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, "Go after those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid good with evil?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Isn't this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination? This is a wicked thing you have done.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But they said to him, "Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master's house?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">If any of your servants is found to have it, he will die; and the rest of us will become my lord's slaves."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Very well, then," he said, "let it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the rest of you will be free from blame."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then the steward proceeded to search, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">At this, they tore their clothes. Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in, and they threw themselves to the ground before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Joseph said to them, "What is this you have done? Don't you know that a man like me can find things out by divination?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"What can we say to my lord?" Judah replied. "What can we say? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants' guilt. We are now my lord's slaves-we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But Joseph said, "Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of you, go back to your father in peace."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then Judah went up to him and said: "Please, my lord, let your servant speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh himself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">My lord asked his servants, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And we answered, 'We have an aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother's sons left, and his father loves him.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">And we said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">But you told your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">When we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"Then our father said, 'Go back and buy a little more food.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">But we said, 'We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">"Your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">One of them went away from me, and I said, "He has surely been torn to pieces." And I have not seen him since.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">"So now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the boy's life,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">sees that the boy isn't there, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Your servant guaranteed the boy's safety to my father. I said, 'If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, all my life!'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">"Now then, please let your servant remain here as my lord's slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery that would come upon my father."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="45">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, "Have everyone leave my presence!" So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh's household heard about it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still living?" But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Come close to me." When they had done so, he said, "I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will not be plowing and reaping.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Now hurry back to my father and say to him, 'This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don't delay.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me-you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">I will provide for you there, because five years of famine are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When the news reached Pharaoh's palace that Joseph's brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"You are also directed to tell them, 'Do this: Take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Never mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of clothes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, "Don't quarrel on the way!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">They told him, "Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt." Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">And Israel said, "I'm convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="46">
<VERS vnumber="1">So Israel set out with all that was his, and when he reached Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said, "Jacob! Jacob!Here I am," he replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"I am God, the God of your father," he said. "Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I will go down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you back again. And Joseph's own hand will close your eyes."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then Jacob left Beersheba, and Israel's sons took their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to transport him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">They also took with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan, and Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He took with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughters-all his offspring.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">These are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who went to Egypt: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez: Hezron and Hamul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puah, Jashub and Shimron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon and Jahleel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">These were the sons Leah bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, besides his daughter Dinah. These sons and daughters of his were thirty-three in all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The sons of Gad: Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi and Areli.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malkiel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">These were the children born to Jacob by Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Leah-sixteen in all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob-fourteen in all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The son of Dan: Hushim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The sons of Naphtali: Jahziel, Guni, Jezer and Shillem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">These were the sons born to Jacob by Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel-seven in all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">All those who went to Egypt with Jacob-those who were his direct descendants, not counting his sons' wives-numbered sixty-six persons.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">With the two sons who had been born to Joseph in Egypt, the members of Jacob's family, which went to Egypt, were seventy in all.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When they arrived in the region of Goshen,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Joseph had his chariot made ready and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as Joseph appeared before him, he threw his arms around his father and wept for a long time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Israel said to Joseph, "Now I am ready to die, since I have seen for myself that you are still alive."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and speak to Pharaoh and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who were living in the land of Canaan, have come to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The men are shepherds; they tend livestock, and they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">When Pharaoh calls you in and asks, 'What is your occupation?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">you should answer, 'Your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood on, just as our fathers did.' Then you will be allowed to settle in the region of Goshen, for all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="47">
<VERS vnumber="1">Joseph went and told Pharaoh, "My father and brothers, with their flocks and herds and everything they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Pharaoh asked the brothers, "What is your occupation?Your servants are shepherds," they replied to Pharaoh, "just as our fathers were."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">They also said to him, "We have come to live here awhile, because the famine is severe in Canaan and your servants' flocks have no pasture. So now, please let your servants settle in Goshen."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">and the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if you know of any among them with special ability, put them in charge of my own livestock."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in and presented him before Pharaoh. After Jacob blessed Pharaoh,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Pharaoh asked him, "How old are you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">And Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. My years have been few and difficult, and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh directed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Joseph also provided his father and his brothers and all his father's household with food, according to the number of their children.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">There was no food, however, in the whole region because the famine was severe; both Egypt and Canaan wasted away because of the famine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in payment for the grain they were buying, and he brought it to Pharaoh's palace.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When the money of the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all Egypt came to Joseph and said, "Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? Our money is used up."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Then bring your livestock," said Joseph. "I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock, since your money is gone."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their sheep and goats, their cattle and donkeys. And he brought them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When that year was over, they came to him the following year and said, "We cannot hide from our lord the fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you, there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Why should we perish before your eyes-we and our land as well? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we with our land will be in bondage to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. The Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields, because the famine was too severe for them. The land became Pharaoh's,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">and Joseph reduced the people to servitude, from one end of Egypt to the other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">However, he did not buy the land of the priests, because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had food enough from the allotment Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Joseph said to the people, "Now that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you so you can plant the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">But when the crop comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"You have saved our lives," they said. "May we find favor in the eyes of our lord; we will be in bondage to Pharaoh."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in Egypt-still in force today-that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharaoh's.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and were fruitful and increased greatly in number.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried.I will do as you say," he said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">"Swear to me," he said. Then Joseph swore to him, and Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="48">
<VERS vnumber="1">Some time later Joseph was told, "Your father is ill." So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">When Jacob was told, "Your son Joseph has come to you," Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed me</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">and said to me, 'I am going to make you fruitful and will increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">As I was returning from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath" (that is, Bethlehem).</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, "Who are these?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"They are the sons God has given me here," Joseph said to his father. Then Israel said, "Bring them to me so I may bless them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Now Israel's eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then Joseph removed them from Israel's knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel's left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel's right hand, and brought them close to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim's head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh's head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then he blessed Joseph and said, "May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">the Angel who has delivered me from all harm -may he bless these boys. May they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they increase greatly upon the earth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim's head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Joseph said to him, "No, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">He blessed them that day and said, "In your name will Israel pronounce this blessing: 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.'" So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Israel said to Joseph, "I am about to die, but God will be with you and take you back to the land of your fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">And to you, as one who is over your brothers, I give the ridge of land I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="49">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Jacob called for his sons and said: "Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, the first sign of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father's bed, onto my couch and defiled it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Simeon and Levi are brothers- their swords are weapons of violence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Let me not enter their council, let me not join their assembly, for they have killed men in their anger and hamstrung oxen as they pleased.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Cursed be their anger, so fierce, and their fury, so cruel! I will scatter them in Jacob and disperse them in Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Judah, your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons will bow down to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">You are a lion's cub, O Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down, like a lioness-who dares to rouse him?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs and the obedience of the nations is his.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter than milk.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships; his border will extend toward Sidon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"Issachar is a rawboned donkey lying down between two saddlebags.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When he sees how good is his resting place and how pleasant is his land, he will bend his shoulder to the burden and submit to forced labor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Dan will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Dan will be a serpent by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse's heels so that its rider tumbles backward.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"I look for your deliverance, O LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Gad will be attacked by a band of raiders, but he will attack them at their heels.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"Asher's food will be rich; he will provide delicacies fit for a king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climb over a wall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">With bitterness archers attacked him; they shot at him with hostility.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">But his bow remained steady, his strong arms stayed limber, because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">because of your father's God, who helps you, because of the Almighty, who blesses you with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of the breast and womb.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Your father's blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains, than the bounty of the age-old hills. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among his brothers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">"Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Then he gave them these instructions: "I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite, along with the field.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and there I buried Leah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites. "</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="50">
<VERS vnumber="1">Joseph threw himself upon his father and wept over him and kissed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh's court, "If I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">'My father made me swear an oath and said, "I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan." Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh's officials accompanied him-the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">besides all the members of Joseph's household and his brothers and those belonging to his father's household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Chariots and horsemen also went up with him. It was a very large company.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning for his father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning." That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">So Jacob's sons did as he had commanded them:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which Abraham had bought as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite, along with the field.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So they sent word to Joseph, saying, "Your father left these instructions before he died:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">'This is what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.' Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father." When their message came to him, Joseph wept.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. "We are your slaves," they said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">But Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid. Am I in the place of God?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So then, don't be afraid. I will provide for you and your children." And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father's family. He lived a hundred and ten years</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">and saw the third generation of Ephraim's children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph's knees.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">And Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath and said, "God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
</BIBLEBOOK>
<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="2" bname="Exodus" bsname="Exod">
<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">and worked them ruthlessly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Yes, go," she answered. And the girl went and got the baby's mother.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So the woman took the baby and nursed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, "I drew him out of the water."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "What I did must have become known."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, "Why have you returned so early today?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"And where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, "I have become an alien in a foreign land."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So Moses thought, "I will go over and see this strange sight-why the bush does not burn up."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, "Moses! Moses!" And Moses said, "Here I am."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"Do not come any closer," God said. "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The LORD said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey-the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">And God said, "I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Moses said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">God said to Moses, "I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers-the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob-has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers-the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob-appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites-a land flowing with milk and honey.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">Moses answered, "What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, 'The LORD did not appear to you'?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then the LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?A staff," he replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The LORD said, "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the LORD said to him, "Reach out your hand and take it by the tail." So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"This," said the LORD, "is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers-the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob-has appeared to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then the LORD said, "Put your hand inside your cloak." So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was leprous, like snow.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Now put it back into your cloak," he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then the LORD said, "If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first miraculous sign, they may believe the second.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Moses said to the LORD, "O Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The LORD said to him, "Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But Moses said, "O Lord, please send someone else to do it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then the LORD's anger burned against Moses and he said, "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and his heart will be glad when he sees you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But take this staff in your hand so you can perform miraculous signs with it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Let me go back to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive." Jethro said, "Go, and I wish you well."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The LORD said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then say to Pharaoh, 'This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="24">At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met {Moses} and was about to kill him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin and touched {Moses'} feet with it. "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me," she said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">So the LORD let him alone. (At that time she said "bridegroom of blood," referring to circumcision.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the desert to meet Moses." So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and also about all the miraculous signs he had commanded him to perform.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">and Aaron told them everything the LORD had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the desert.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But the king of Egypt said, "Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and foremen in charge of the people:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Make the work harder for the men so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then the slave drivers and the foremen went out and said to the people, "This is what Pharaoh says: 'I will not give you any more straw.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, "Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The Israelite foremen appointed by Pharaoh's slave drivers were beaten and were asked, "Why didn't you meet your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: "Why have you treated your servants this way?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, 'Make bricks!' Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Pharaoh said, "Lazy, that's what you are-lazy! That is why you keep saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, "You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">and they said, "May the LORD look upon you and judge you! You have made us a stench to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Moses returned to the LORD and said, "O Lord, why have you brought trouble upon this people? Is this why you sent me?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble upon this people, and you have not rescued your people at all."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">God also said to Moses, "I am the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they lived as aliens.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Therefore, say to the Israelites: 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and cruel bondage.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then the LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But Moses said to the LORD, "If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">These were the heads of their families: The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and Shimei.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi according to their records.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="26">It was this same Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, "Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt. It was the same Moses and Aaron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Now when the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">he said to him, "I am the LORD. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">But Moses said to the LORD, "Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the LORD said to Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="5">And the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"When Pharaoh says to you, 'Perform a miracle,' then say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,' and it will become a snake."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Yet Pharaoh's heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the water. Wait on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the desert. But until now you have not listened.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the LORD: With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt-over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs'-and they will turn to blood. Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in the wooden buckets and stone jars."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh's heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Instead, he turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Seven days passed after the LORD struck the Nile.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">If you refuse to let them go, I will plague your whole country with frogs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The frogs will go up on you and your people and all your officials.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Pray to the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Moses said to Pharaoh, "I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Tomorrow," Pharaoh said. Moses replied, "It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the LORD our God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the LORD about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And the LORD did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,' and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came upon men and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not. And the gnats were on men and animals.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the LORD had said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the water and say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and even the ground where they are.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"'But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the LORD, am in this land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This miraculous sign will occur tomorrow.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">And the LORD did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh's palace and into the houses of his officials, and throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">But Moses said, "That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the LORD our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">We must take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, as he commands us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Pharaoh said, "I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God in the desert, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Moses answered, "As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only be sure that Pharaoh does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">and the LORD did what Moses asked: The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, so that they may worship me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">the hand of the LORD will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field-on your horses and donkeys and camels and on your cattle and sheep and goats.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The LORD set a time and said, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this in the land."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">And the next day the LORD did it: All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Pharaoh sent men to investigate and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on men and animals throughout the land."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on men and animals.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said to Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every man and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But those who ignored the word of the LORD left their slaves and livestock in the field.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt-on men and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields-both men and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. "This time I have sinned," he said to them. "The LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Pray to the LORD, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don't have to stay any longer."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Moses replied, "When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the LORD. The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth is the LORD's.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the LORD God."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">(The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The wheat and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the LORD; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened their hearts.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">So Pharaoh's heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="5">They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians-something neither your fathers nor your forefathers have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.'" Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Pharaoh's officials said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. "Go, worship the LORD your God," he said. "But just who will be going?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Moses answered, "We will go with our young and old, with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Pharaoh said, "The LORD be with you-if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">No! Have only the men go; and worship the LORD, since that's what you have been asking for." Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh's presence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">And the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts will swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail-everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away from me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness will spread over Egypt-darkness that can be felt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">No one could see anyone else or leave his place for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, "Go, worship the LORD. Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">But Moses said, "You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the LORD our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Pharaoh said to Moses, "Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">"Just as you say," Moses replied, "I will never appear before you again."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now the LORD had said to Moses, "I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">(The LORD made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh's officials and by the people.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So Moses said, "This is what the LORD says: 'About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the slave girl, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt-worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any man or animal.' Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, 'Go, you and all the people who follow you!' After that I will leave." Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The LORD had said to Moses, "Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you-so that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the people of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Do not eat the meat raw or cooked in water, but roast it over the fire-head, legs and inner parts.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD's Passover.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn-both men and animals-and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD -a lasting ordinance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat-that is all you may do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And whoever eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel, whether he is an alien or native-born.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. Not one of you shall go out the door of his house until morning.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">When the LORD goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">And when your children ask you, 'What does this ceremony mean to you?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">then tell them, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.'" Then the people bowed down and worshiped.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">The Israelites did just what the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. "For otherwise," they said, "we will all die!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">The LORD had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Many other people went up with them, as well as large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">With the dough they had brought from Egypt, they baked cakes of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt was 430 years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD's divisions left Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">Because the LORD kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the LORD for the generations to come.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "These are the regulations for the Passover: "No foreigner is to eat of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">Any slave you have bought may eat of it after you have circumcised him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">but a temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">"It must be eaten inside one house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">"An alien living among you who wants to celebrate the LORD's Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">The same law applies to the native-born and to the alien living among you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">All the Israelites did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">And on that very day the LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether man or animal."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then Moses said to the people, "Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the LORD brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites-the land he swore to your forefathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey-you are to observe this ceremony in this month:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">On that day tell your son, 'I do this because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"After the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your forefathers,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">you are to give over to the LORD the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"In days to come, when your son asks you, 'What does this mean?' say to him, 'With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn in Egypt, both man and animal. This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the LORD brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, "If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of Egypt armed for battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear an oath. He had said, "God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">After leaving Succoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Pharaoh will think, 'The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD." So the Israelites did this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, "What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The Egyptians-all Pharaoh's horses and chariots, horsemen and troops-pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">They said to Moses, "Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Didn't we say to you in Egypt, 'Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians'? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Moses answered the people, "Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel's army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">During the last watch of the night the LORD looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">He made the wheels of their chariots come off so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, "Let's get away from the Israelites! The LORD is fighting for them against Egypt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward it, and the LORD swept them into the sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen-the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">That day the LORD saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">And when the Israelites saw the great power the LORD displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: "I will sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted. The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea. The best of Pharaoh's officers are drowned in the Red Sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The deep waters have covered them; they sank to the depths like a stone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Your right hand, O LORD, was majestic in power. Your right hand, O LORD, shattered the enemy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">In the greatness of your majesty you threw down those who opposed you. You unleashed your burning anger; it consumed them like stubble.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">By the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up. The surging waters stood firm like a wall; the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"The enemy boasted, 'I will pursue, I will overtake them. I will divide the spoils; I will gorge myself on them. I will draw my sword and my hand will destroy them.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Who among the gods is like you, O LORD? Who is like you- majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">You stretched out your right hand and the earth swallowed them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"In your unfailing love you will lead the people you have redeemed. In your strength you will guide them to your holy dwelling.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The nations will hear and tremble; anguish will grip the people of Philistia.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The chiefs of Edom will be terrified, the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling, the people of Canaan will melt away;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">terror and dread will fall upon them. By the power of your arm they will be as still as a stone- until your people pass by, O LORD, until the people you bought pass by.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance- the place, O LORD, you made for your dwelling, the sanctuary, O Lord, your hands established.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The LORD will reign for ever and ever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When Pharaoh's horses, chariots and horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them, but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her, with tambourines and dancing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Miriam sang to them: "Sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted. The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">When they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah. )</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, "What are we to drink?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. There the LORD made a decree and a law for them, and there he tested them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He said, "If you listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, who heals you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
<VERS vnumber="1">The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by the LORD's hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the LORD said to Moses, "I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, "In the evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of Egypt,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Moses also said, "You will know that it was the LORD when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then Moses told Aaron, "Say to the entire Israelite community, 'Come before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the LORD appearing in the cloud.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, 'At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Each one is to gather as much as he needs. Take an omer for each person you have in your tent.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And when they measured it by the omer, he who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little. Each one gathered as much as he needed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then Moses said to them, "No one is to keep any of it until morning."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Each morning everyone gathered as much as he needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much-two omers for each person-and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">He said to them, "This is what the LORD commanded: 'Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"Eat it today," Moses said, "because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. You will not find any of it on the ground today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then the LORD said to Moses, "How long will you refuse to keep my commands and my instructions?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Bear in mind that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where he is on the seventh day; no one is to go out."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">So the people rested on the seventh day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">The people of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the desert when I brought you out of Egypt.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">So Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be kept for the generations to come."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna in front of the Testimony, that it might be kept.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">(An omer is one tenth of an ephah.)</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
<VERS vnumber="1">The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin, traveling from place to place as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So they quarreled with Moses and said, "Give us water to drink." Moses replied, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the LORD to the test?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, "Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then Moses cried out to the LORD, "What am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The LORD answered Moses, "Walk on ahead of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink." So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And he called the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the LORD saying, "Is the LORD among us or not?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Moses said to Joshua, "Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When Moses' hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up-one on one side, one on the other-so that his hands remained steady till sunset.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Moses built an altar and called it The LORD is my Banner.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He said, "For hands were lifted up to the throne of the LORD. The LORD will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and father-in-law of Moses, heard of everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and her two sons. One son was named Gershom, for Moses said, "I have become an alien in a foreign land";</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">and the other was named Eliezer, for he said, "My father's God was my helper; he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, together with Moses' sons and wife, came to him in the desert, where he was camped near the mountain of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Jethro had sent word to him, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Moses told his father-in-law about everything the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the LORD had saved them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the LORD had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He said, "Praise be to the LORD, who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Now I know that the LORD is greater than all other gods, for he did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law in the presence of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, "What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Moses answered him, "Because the people come to me to seek God's will.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God's decrees and laws."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Moses' father-in-law replied, "What you are doing is not good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people's representative before God and bring their disputes to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Teach them the decrees and laws, and show them the way to live and the duties they are to perform.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But select capable men from all the people-men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain-and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own country.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the third month after the Israelites left Egypt-on the very day-they came to the Desert of Sinai.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain and said, "This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">'You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the LORD had commanded him to speak.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The people all responded together, "We will do everything the LORD has said." So Moses brought their answer back to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The LORD said to Moses, "I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you." Then Moses told the LORD what the people had said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">And the LORD said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">and be ready by the third day, because on that day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, 'Be careful that you do not go up the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on him. Whether man or animal, he shall not be permitted to live.' Only when the ram's horn sounds a long blast may they go up to the mountain."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then he said to the people, "Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, the whole mountain trembled violently,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">and the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder. Then Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">and the LORD said to him, "Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the LORD and many of them perish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Even the priests, who approach the LORD, must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, 'Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The LORD replied, "Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the LORD, or he will break out against them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">So Moses went down to the people and told them.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
<VERS vnumber="1">And God spoke all these words:</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="4">"You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Six days you shall labor and do all your work,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="18">When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">and said to Moses, "Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites this: 'You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven:</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="7">"If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as menservants do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself, he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="13">Each one who crosses over to those already counted is to give a half shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs. This half shekel is an offering to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">All who cross over, those twenty years old or more, are to give an offering to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The rich are not to give more than a half shekel and the poor are not to give less when you make the offering to the LORD to atone for your lives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Receive the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the Tent of Meeting. It will be a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD, making atonement for your lives."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then the LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"Make a bronze basin, with its bronze stand, for washing. Place it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Aaron and his sons are to wash their hands and feet with water from it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water so that they will not die. Also, when they approach the altar to minister by presenting an offering made to the LORD by fire,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">they shall wash their hands and feet so that they will not die. This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants for the generations to come."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then the LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"Take the following fine spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, half as much (that is, 250 shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant cane,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">500 shekels of cassia-all according to the sanctuary shekel-and a hin of olive oil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Make these into a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer. It will be the sacred anointing oil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then use it to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">You shall consecrate them so they will be most holy, and whatever touches them will be holy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">"Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so they may serve me as priests.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Say to the Israelites, 'This is to be my sacred anointing oil for the generations to come.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Do not pour it on men's bodies and do not make any oil with the same formula. It is sacred, and you are to consider it sacred.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Whoever makes perfume like it and whoever puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from his people.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Take fragrant spices-gum resin, onycha and galbanum-and pure frankincense, all in equal amounts,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer. It is to be salted and pure and sacred.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Grind some of it to powder and place it in front of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Do not make any incense with this formula for yourselves; consider it holy to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Whoever makes any like it to enjoy its fragrance must be cut off from his people."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="31">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all kinds of crafts-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of craftsmanship.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also I have given skill to all the craftsmen to make everything I have commanded you:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">the table and its articles, the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of incense,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin with its stand-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">and also the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">and the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then the LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"Say to the Israelites, 'You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the LORD, who makes you holy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"'Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it must be put to death; whoever does any work on that day must be cut off from his people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must be put to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he abstained from work and rested.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When the LORD finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the Testimony, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="32">
<VERS vnumber="1">When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, "Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Aaron answered them, "Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, "Tomorrow there will be a festival to the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"I have seen these people," the LORD said to Moses, "and they are a stiff-necked people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God. "O LORD," he said, "why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Why should the Egyptians say, 'It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, "There is the sound of war in the camp."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Moses replied: "It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"Do not be angry, my lord," Aaron answered. "You know how prone these people are to evil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">They said to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">So I told them, 'Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, come to me." And all the Levites rallied to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Then Moses said, "You have been set apart to the LORD today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">So Moses went back to the LORD and said, "Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">But now, please forgive their sin-but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">The LORD replied to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">And the LORD struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="33">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of Egypt, and go up to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I will send an angel before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">For the LORD had said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the "tent of meeting." Anyone inquiring of the LORD would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance, while the LORD spoke with Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to his tent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Moses said to the LORD, "You have been telling me, 'Lead these people,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, 'I know you by name and you have found favor with me.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The LORD replied, "My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Moses said to him, "If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">And the LORD said to Moses, "I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then Moses said, "Now show me your glory."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">And the LORD said, "I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the LORD, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">But," he said, "you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then the LORD said, "There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="34">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD said to Moses, "Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the LORD had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then the LORD came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, "The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"O Lord, if I have found favor in your eyes," he said, "then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then the LORD said: "I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people I will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people you live among will see how awesome is the work that I, the LORD, will do for you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Obey what I command you today. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going, or they will be a snare among you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Do not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will lead your sons to do the same.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Do not make cast idols.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in that month you came out of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"The first offspring of every womb belongs to me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether from herd or flock.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons. "No one is to appear before me empty-handed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"Celebrate the Feast of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the LORD your God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">"Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Feast remain until morning.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">"Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God. "Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Moses was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant-the Ten Commandments.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">But Moses called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Afterward all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the LORD had given him on Mount Sinai.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">But whenever he entered the LORD's presence to speak with him, he removed the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">they saw that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the LORD.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="35">
<VERS vnumber="1">Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them, "These are the things the LORD has commanded you to do:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a Sabbath of rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it must be put to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Moses said to the whole Israelite community, "This is what the LORD has commanded:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">From what you have, take an offering for the LORD. Everyone who is willing is to bring to the LORD an offering of gold, silver and bronze;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">ram skins dyed red and hides of sea cows; acacia wood;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"All who are skilled among you are to come and make everything the LORD has commanded:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">the ark with its poles and the atonement cover and the curtain that shields it;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">the table with its poles and all its articles and the bread of the Presence;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">the lampstand that is for light with its accessories, lamps and oil for the light;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the bronze basin with its stand;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, and their ropes;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary-both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then the whole Israelite community withdrew from Moses' presence,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">and everyone who was willing and whose heart moved him came and brought an offering to the LORD for the work on the Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">All who were willing, men and women alike, came and brought gold jewelry of all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Everyone who had blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen, or goat hair, ram skins dyed red or hides of sea cows brought them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Those presenting an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the LORD, and everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun-blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">And all the women who were willing and had the skill spun the goat hair.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">They also brought spices and olive oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">All the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the LORD freewill offerings for all the work the LORD through Moses had commanded them to do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then Moses said to the Israelites, "See, the LORD has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all kinds of crafts-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">to cut and set stones, to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of artistic craftsmanship.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">And he has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as craftsmen, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers-all of them master craftsmen and designers.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="36">
<VERS vnumber="1">So Bezalel, Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the LORD has given skill and ability to know how to carry out all the work of constructing the sanctuary are to do the work just as the LORD has commanded."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the LORD had given ability and who was willing to come and do the work.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. And the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So all the skilled craftsmen who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left their work</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">and said to Moses, "The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the LORD commanded to be done."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then Moses gave an order and they sent this word throughout the camp: "No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary." And so the people were restrained from bringing more,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">because what they already had was more than enough to do all the work.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">All the skilled men among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim worked into them by a skilled craftsman.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">All the curtains were the same size-twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">They joined five of the curtains together and did the same with the other five.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then they made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the same was done with the end curtain in the other set.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They also made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then they made fifty gold clasps and used them to fasten the two sets of curtains together so that the tabernacle was a unit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle-eleven altogether.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">All eleven curtains were the same size-thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">They joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another set.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then they made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">They made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the tent together as a unit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then they made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of hides of sea cows.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">They made upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Each frame was ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">with two projections set parallel to each other. They made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">They made twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">and made forty silver bases to go under them-two bases for each frame, one under each projection.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty frames</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">and forty silver bases-two under each frame.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">They made six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">and two frames were made for the corners of the tabernacle at the far end.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">At these two corners the frames were double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a single ring; both were made alike.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases-two under each frame.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">From the blue, purple and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary. They also made sacred garments for Aaron, as the LORD commanded Moses.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut strands to be worked into the blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen-the work of a skilled craftsman.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached to two of its corners, so it could be fastened.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Its skillfully woven waistband was like it-of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen, as the LORD commanded Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree settings and engraved them like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then they fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the LORD commanded Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">They fashioned the breastpiece-the work of a skilled craftsman. They made it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">It was square-a span long and a span wide-and folded double.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then they mounted four rows of precious stones on it. In the first row there was a ruby, a topaz and a beryl;</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="14">There were twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">For the breastpiece they made braided chains of pure gold, like a rope.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the rings to two of the corners of the breastpiece.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They fastened the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="19">They made two gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">They tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece would not swing out from the ephod-as the LORD commanded Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth-the work of a weaver-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">with an opening in the center of the robe like the opening of a collar, and a band around this opening, so that it would not tear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">They made pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="26">The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem of the robe to be worn for ministering, as the LORD commanded Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen-the work of a weaver-</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="5">They took the things Moses commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting, and the entire assembly came near and stood before the LORD.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="8">So Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">His sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys and the covering of the liver from the sin offering, as the LORD commanded Moses;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">the flesh and the hide he burned up outside the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it against the altar on all sides.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He washed the inner parts and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Aaron then brought the offering that was for the people. He took the goat for the people's sin offering and slaughtered it and offered it for a sin offering as he did with the first one.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He brought the burnt offering and offered it in the prescribed way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He also brought the grain offering, took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning's burnt offering.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the fellowship offering for the people. His sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it against the altar on all sides.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">But the fat portions of the ox and the ram-the fat tail, the layer of fat, the kidneys and the covering of the liver-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">these they laid on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="22">Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offering, he stepped down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Moses and Aaron then went into the Tent of Meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, contrary to his command.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">Moses then said to Aaron, "This is what the LORD spoke of when he said: "'Among those who approach me I will show myself holy; in the sight of all the people I will be honored.'" Aaron remained silent.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="12">Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, "Take the grain offering left over from the offerings made to the LORD by fire and eat it prepared without yeast beside the altar, for it is most holy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Eat it in a holy place, because it is your share and your sons' share of the offerings made to the LORD by fire; for so I have been commanded.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. Eat them in a ceremonially clean place; they have been given to you and your children as your share of the Israelites' fellowship offerings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The thigh that was presented and the breast that was waved must be brought with the fat portions of the offerings made by fire, to be waved before the LORD as a wave offering. This will be the regular share for you and your children, as the LORD has commanded."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering and found that it had been burned up, he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's remaining sons, and asked,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Why didn't you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the LORD.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="24">and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out, under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out for the place about which the LORD said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">He answered, "No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">But Moses said, "Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the desert, and you can be our eyes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">So they set out from the mountain of the LORD and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">The cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, "Rise up, O LORD! May your enemies be scattered; may your foes flee before you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Whenever it came to rest, he said, "Return, O LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel."</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the LORD, and when he heard them his anger was aroused. Then fire from the LORD burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the LORD and the fire died down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So that place was called Taberah, because fire from the LORD had burned among them. Quail From the LORD</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, "If only we had meat to eat!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost-also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in a handmill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into cakes. And it tasted like something made with olive oil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Moses heard the people of every family wailing, each at the entrance to his tent. The LORD became exceedingly angry, and Moses was troubled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He asked the LORD, "Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their forefathers?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, 'Give us meat to eat!'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">If this is how you are going to treat me, put me to death right now-if I have found favor in your eyes-and do not let me face my own ruin."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The LORD said to Moses: "Bring me seventy of Israel's elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit that is on you and put the Spirit on them. They will help you carry the burden of the people so that you will not have to carry it alone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"Tell the people: 'Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. The LORD heard you when you wailed, "If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!" Now the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">but for a whole month-until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it-because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But Moses said, "Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, 'I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The LORD answered Moses, "Is the LORD's arm too short? You will now see whether or not what I say will come true for you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">So Moses went out and told the people what the LORD had said. He brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the Tent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took of the Spirit that was on him and put the Spirit on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did not do so again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the Tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">A young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses' aide since youth, spoke up and said, "Moses, my lord, stop them!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">But Moses replied, "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the LORD's people were prophets and that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Now a wind went out from the LORD and drove quail in from the sea. It brought them down all around the camp to about three feet above the ground, as far as a day's walk in any direction.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail. No one gathered less than ten homers. Then they spread them out all around the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had craved other food.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
<VERS vnumber="1">Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Has the LORD spoken only through Moses?" they asked. "Hasn't he also spoken through us?" And the LORD heard this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">(Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">At once the LORD said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, "Come out to the Tent of Meeting, all three of you." So the three of them came out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the Tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them stepped forward,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">he said, "Listen to my words: "When a prophet of the LORD is among you, I reveal myself to him in visions, I speak to him in dreams.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The anger of the LORD burned against them, and he left them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When the cloud lifted from above the Tent, there stood Miriam-leprous, like snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had leprosy;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">and he said to Moses, "Please, my lord, do not hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother's womb with its flesh half eaten away."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So Moses cried out to the LORD, "O God, please heal her!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The LORD replied to Moses, "If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she can be brought back."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on till she was brought back.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">After that, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Desert of Paran.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So at the LORD's command Moses sent them out from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders of the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">These are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="14">from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, "Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees on it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land." (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">When they reached the Valley of Eshcol, they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">They gave Moses this account: "We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, "We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">But the men who had gone up with him said, "We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, "The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
<VERS vnumber="1">That night all the people of the community raised their voices and wept aloud.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them, "If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this desert!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Why is the LORD bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And they said to each other, "We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">and said to the entire Israelite assembly, "The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">If the LORD is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Only do not rebel against the LORD. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will swallow them up. Their protection is gone, but the LORD is with us. Do not be afraid of them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the Tent of Meeting to all the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The LORD said to Moses, "How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the miraculous signs I have performed among them?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Moses said to the LORD, "Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, O LORD, are with these people and that you, O LORD, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">If you put these people to death all at one time, the nations who have heard this report about you will say,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">'The LORD was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath; so he slaughtered them in the desert.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Now may the Lord's strength be displayed, just as you have declared:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">'The LORD is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The LORD replied, "I have forgiven them, as you asked.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the LORD fills the whole earth,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">not one of the men who saw my glory and the miraculous signs I performed in Egypt and in the desert but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their forefathers. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Since the Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea. "</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The LORD said to Moses and Aaron:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">"How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">So tell them, 'As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you the very things I heard you say:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">In this desert your bodies will fall-every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">But you-your bodies will fall in this desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">For forty years-one year for each of the forty days you explored the land-you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this desert; here they will die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">these men responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Early the next morning they went up toward the high hill country. "We have sinned," they said. "We will go up to the place the LORD promised."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">But Moses said, "Why are you disobeying the LORD's command? This will not succeed!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">Do not go up, because the LORD is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">for the Amalekites and Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the LORD, he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the high hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the LORD's covenant moved from the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">Then the Amalekites and Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="20">The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, "O God, God of the spirits of all mankind, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then the LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"Say to the assembly, 'Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">He warned the assembly, "Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then Moses said, "This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">If these men die a natural death and experience only what usually happens to men, then the LORD has not sent me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">But if the LORD brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the grave, then you will know that these men have treated the LORD with contempt."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, with their households and all Korah's men and all their possessions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">They went down alive into the grave, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, "The earth is going to swallow us too!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">The LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">"Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to take the censers out of the smoldering remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the LORD and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned up, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">as the LORD directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the LORD, or he would become like Korah and his followers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. "You have killed the LORD's people," they said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the Tent of Meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">and the LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">"Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once." And they fell facedown.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">Then Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer and put incense in it, along with fire from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague has started."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, for the plague had stopped.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them, one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of each man on his staff.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="4">Place them in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony, where I meet with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and Aaron's staff was among them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the Tent of the Testimony.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The next day Moses entered the Tent of the Testimony and saw that Aaron's staff, which represented the house of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD's presence to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each man took his own staff.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The LORD said to Moses, "Put back Aaron's staff in front of the Testimony, to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will put an end to their grumbling against me, so that they will not die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Moses did just as the LORD commanded him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The Israelites said to Moses, "We will die! We are lost, we are all lost!</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">They are to be responsible to you and are to perform all the duties of the Tent, but they must not go near the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar, or both they and you will die.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD said to Moses and Aaron:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"This is a requirement of the law that the LORD has commanded: Tell the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has never been under a yoke.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Give it to Eleazar the priest; it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the Tent of Meeting.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">While he watches, the heifer is to be burned-its hide, flesh, blood and offal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">After that, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water. He may then come into the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The man who burns it must also wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he too will be unclean till evening.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and put them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They shall be kept by the Israelite community for use in the water of cleansing; it is for purification from sin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he too will be unclean till evening. This will be a lasting ordinance both for the Israelites and for the aliens living among them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Whoever touches the dead body of anyone will be unclean for seven days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He must purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third and seventh days, he will not be clean.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Whoever touches the dead body of anyone and fails to purify himself defiles the LORD's tabernacle. That person must be cut off from Israel. Because the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him, he is unclean; his uncleanness remains on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"This is the law that applies when a person dies in a tent: Anyone who enters the tent and anyone who is in it will be unclean for seven days,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="16">"Anyone out in the open who touches someone who has been killed with a sword or someone who has died a natural death, or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"For the unclean person, put some ashes from the burned purification offering into a jar and pour fresh water over them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were there. He must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave or someone who has been killed or someone who has died a natural death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The man who is clean is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third and seventh days, and on the seventh day he is to purify him. The person being cleansed must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and that evening he will be clean.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="21">This is a lasting ordinance for them. "The man who sprinkles the water of cleansing must also wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water of cleansing will be unclean till evening.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the first month the whole Israelite community arrived at the Desert of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Now there was no water for the community, and the people gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">They quarreled with Moses and said, "If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the LORD!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Why did you bring the LORD's community into this desert, that we and our livestock should die here?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain or figs, grapevines or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and fell facedown, and the glory of the LORD appeared to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together. Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community so they and their livestock can drink."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So Moses took the staff from the LORD's presence, just as he commanded him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, "Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">These were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with the LORD and where he showed himself holy among them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: "This is what your brother Israel says: You know about all the hardships that have come upon us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Our forefathers went down into Egypt, and we lived there many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">but when we cried out to the LORD, he heard our cry and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. "Now we are here at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the king's highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But Edom answered: "You may not pass through here; if you try, we will march out and attack you with the sword."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The Israelites replied: "We will go along the main road, and if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to pass through on foot-nothing else."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Again they answered: "You may not pass through." Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Since Edom refused to let them go through their territory, Israel turned away from them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">At Mount Hor, near the border of Edom, the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I give the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Remove Aaron's garments and put them on his son Eleazar, for Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will die there."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Moses did as the LORD commanded: They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Moses removed Aaron's garments and put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">and when the whole community learned that Aaron had died, the entire house of Israel mourned for him thirty days.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
<VERS vnumber="1">When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked the Israelites and captured some of them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then Israel made this vow to the LORD: "If you will deliver these people into our hands, we will totally destroy their cities."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The LORD listened to Israel's plea and gave the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns; so the place was named Hormah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the desert? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then the LORD sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The people came to Moses and said, "We sinned when we spoke against the LORD and against you. Pray that the LORD will take the snakes away from us." So Moses prayed for the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The LORD said to Moses, "Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, he lived.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, in the desert that faces Moab toward the sunrise.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the desert extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">That is why the Book of the Wars of the LORD says: "...Waheb in Suphah and the ravines, the Arnon</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">and the slopes of the ravines that lead to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the LORD said to Moses, "Gather the people together and I will give them water."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Israel sang this song: "Spring up, O well! Sing about it,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">about the well that the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank- the nobles with scepters and staffs." Then they went from the desert to Mattanah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the king's highway until we have passed through your territory."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He mustered his entire army and marched out into the desert against Israel. When he reached Jahaz, he fought with Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Israel, however, put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, but only as far as the Ammonites, because their border was fortified.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">That is why the poets say: "Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt; let Sihon's city be restored.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">"Fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the citizens of Arnon's heights.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Woe to you, O Moab! You are destroyed, O people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to Sihon king of the Amorites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">"But we have overthrown them; Heshbon is destroyed all the way to Dibon. We have demolished them as far as Nophah, which extends to Medeba."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, the Israelites captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at Edrei.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">The LORD said to Moses, "Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you, with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">So they struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army, leaving them no survivors. And they took possession of his land.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="4">The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, "This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field." So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the River, in his native land. Balak said: "A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the country. For I know that those you bless are blessed, and those you curse are cursed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Spend the night here," Balaam said to them, "and I will bring you back the answer the LORD gives me." So the Moabite princes stayed with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">God came to Balaam and asked, "Who are these men with you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Balaam said to God, "Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">'A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But God said to Balaam, "Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak's princes, "Go back to your own country, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So the Moabite princes returned to Balak and said, "Balaam refused to come with us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Balak sent other princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">They came to Balaam and said: "This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But Balaam answered them, "Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the LORD my God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Now stay here tonight as the others did, and I will find out what else the LORD will tell me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">That night God came to Balaam and said, "Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, she turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat her to get her back on the road.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between two vineyards, with walls on both sides.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam's foot against it. So he beat her again.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then the angel of the LORD moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat her with his staff.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then the LORD opened the donkey's mouth, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Balaam answered the donkey, "You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?No," he said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The angel of the LORD asked him, "Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared her."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, "I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">The angel of the LORD said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you." So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn't you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">"Well, I have come to you now," Balaam replied. "But can I say just anything? I must speak only what God puts in my mouth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the princes who were with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he saw part of the people.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
<VERS vnumber="1">Balaam said, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you." Then he went off to a barren height.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">God met with him, and Balaam said, "I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The LORD put a message in Balaam's mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this message."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the princes of Moab.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then Balaam uttered his oracle: "Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. 'Come,' he said, 'curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the LORD has not denounced?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">From the rocky peaks I see them, from the heights I view them. I see a people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Who can count the dust of Jacob or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my end be like theirs!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">He answered, "Must I not speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then Balak said to him, "Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will see only a part but not all of them. And from there, curse them for me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The LORD met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this message."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the princes of Moab. Balak asked him, "What did the LORD say?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then he uttered his oracle: "Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">I have received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot change it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery observed in Israel. The LORD their God is with them; the shout of the King is among them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">There is no sorcery against Jacob, no divination against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, 'See what God has done!'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till he devours his prey and drinks the blood of his victims."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Balaam answered, "Did I not tell you I must do whatever the LORD says?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then Balak said to Balaam, "Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Balaam said, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not resort to sorcery as at other times, but turned his face toward the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came upon him</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and he uttered his oracle: "The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob, your dwelling places, O Israel!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Like valleys they spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the LORD, like cedars beside the waters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Water will flow from their buckets; their seed will have abundant water. "Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. They devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces; with their arrows they pierce them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Like a lion they crouch and lie down, like a lioness-who dares to rouse them? "May those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then Balak's anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, "I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the LORD has kept you from being rewarded."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Balaam answered Balak, "Did I not tell the messengers you sent me,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">'Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the LORD -and I must say only what the LORD says'?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then he uttered his oracle: "The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of all the sons of Sheth.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="19">A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then Balaam saw Amalek and uttered his oracle: "Amalek was first among the nations, but he will come to ruin at last."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then he saw the Kenites and uttered his oracle: "Your dwelling place is secure, your nest is set in a rock;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">yet you Kenites will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then he uttered his oracle: "Ah, who can live when God does this?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Ships will come from the shores of Kittim; they will subdue Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to ruin."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then Balaam got up and returned home and Balak went his own way.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
<VERS vnumber="1">While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with Moabite women,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods. The people ate and bowed down before these gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So Israel joined in worshiping the Baal of Peor. And the LORD's anger burned against them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The LORD said to Moses, "Take all the leaders of these people, kill them and expose them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that the LORD's fierce anger may turn away from Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So Moses said to Israel's judges, "Each of you must put to death those of your men who have joined in worshiping the Baal of Peor."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then an Israelite man brought to his family a Midianite woman right before the eyes of Moses and the whole assembly of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="8">and followed the Israelite into the tent. He drove the spear through both of them-through the Israelite and into the woman's body. Then the plague against the Israelites was stopped;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites; for he was as zealous as I am for my honor among them, so that in my zeal I did not put an end to them.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="13">He and his descendants will have a covenant of a lasting priesthood, because he was zealous for the honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And the name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Cozbi daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The LORD said to Moses,</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="31">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So Moses said to the people, "Arm some of your men to go to war against the Midianites and to carry out the LORD's vengeance on them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So twelve thousand men armed for battle, a thousand from each tribe, were supplied from the clans of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Moses sent them into battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">They fought against Midian, as the LORD commanded Moses, and killed every man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba-the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Moses was angry with the officers of the army-the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds-who returned from the battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"Have you allowed all the women to live?" he asked them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"They were the ones who followed Balaam's advice and were the means of turning the Israelites away from the LORD in what happened at Peor, so that a plague struck the LORD's people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"All of you who have killed anyone or touched anyone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, "This is the requirement of the law that the LORD gave Moses:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">"You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community are to count all the people and animals that were captured.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Divide the spoils between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="30">From the Israelites' half, select one out of every fifty, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats or other animals. Give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the LORD's tabernacle."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675,000 sheep,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">72,000 cattle,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">61,000 donkeys</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">and 32,000 women who had never slept with a man.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="40">16,000 people, of which the tribute for the LORD was 32.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the LORD's part, as the LORD commanded Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">The half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses set apart from that of the fighting men-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">the community's half-was 337,500 sheep,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="45">30,500 donkeys</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">and 16,000 people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">From the Israelites' half, Moses selected one out of every fifty persons and animals, as the LORD commanded him, and gave them to the Levites, who were responsible for the care of the LORD's tabernacle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">Then the officers who were over the units of the army-the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds-went to Moses</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">and said to him, "Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one is missing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">So we have brought as an offering to the LORD the gold articles each of us acquired-armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces-to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold-all the crafted articles.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="52">All the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds that Moses and Eleazar presented as a gift to the LORD weighed 16,750 shekels.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="53">Each soldier had taken plunder for himself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="54">Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the Tent of Meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="32">
<VERS vnumber="1">The Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, and said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">the land the LORD subdued before the people of Israel-are suitable for livestock, and your servants have livestock.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">If we have found favor in your eyes," they said, "let this land be given to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, "Shall your countrymen go to war while you sit here?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Why do you discourage the Israelites from going over into the land the LORD has given them?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">After they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and viewed the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the LORD had given them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The LORD's anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">'Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly, not one of the men twenty years old or more who came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the LORD wholeheartedly.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The LORD's anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the desert forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"And here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your fathers and making the LORD even more angry with Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">If you turn away from following him, he will again leave all this people in the desert, and you will be the cause of their destruction."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then they came up to him and said, "We would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our women and children.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But we are ready to arm ourselves and go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our women and children will live in fortified cities, for protection from the inhabitants of the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has received his inheritance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">We will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then Moses said to them, "If you will do this-if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for battle,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">and if all of you will go armed over the Jordan before the LORD until he has driven his enemies out before him-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">then when the land is subdued before the LORD, you may return and be free from your obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will be your possession before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"But if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the LORD; and you may be sure that your sin will find you out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, "We your servants will do as our lord commands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">But your servants, every man armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the LORD, just as our lord says."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">He said to them, "If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the LORD, then when the land is subdued before you, give them the land of Gilead as their possession.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession with you in Canaan."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">The Gadites and Reubenites answered, "Your servants will do what the LORD has said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">We will cross over before the LORD into Canaan armed, but the property we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan-the whole land with its cities and the territory around them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">The Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their flocks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh and Kiriathaim,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">as well as Nebo and Baal Meon (these names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">The descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it and drove out the Amorites who were there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, the descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured their settlements and called them Havvoth Jair.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, the LORD said to Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Command the Israelites to give the Levites towns to live in from the inheritance the Israelites will possess. And give them pasturelands around the towns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then they will have towns to live in and pasturelands for their cattle, flocks and all their other livestock.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"The pasturelands around the towns that you give the Levites will extend out fifteen hundred feet from the town wall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Outside the town, measure three thousand feet on the east side, three thousand on the south side, three thousand on the west and three thousand on the north, with the town in the center. They will have this area as pastureland for the towns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge, to which a person who has killed someone may flee. In addition, give them forty-two other towns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">In all you must give the Levites forty-eight towns, together with their pasturelands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The towns you give the Levites from the land the Israelites possess are to be given in proportion to the inheritance of each tribe: Take many towns from a tribe that has many, but few from one that has few."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then the LORD said to Moses:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'When you cross the Jordan into Canaan,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">select some towns to be your cities of refuge, to which a person who has killed someone accidentally may flee.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They will be places of refuge from the avenger, so that a person accused of murder may not die before he stands trial before the assembly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">These six towns you give will be your cities of refuge.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Give three on this side of the Jordan and three in Canaan as cities of refuge.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">These six towns will be a place of refuge for Israelites, aliens and any other people living among them, so that anyone who has killed another accidentally can flee there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"'If a man strikes someone with an iron object so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Or if anyone has a stone in his hand that could kill, and he strikes someone so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Or if anyone has a wooden object in his hand that could kill, and he hits someone so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death; when he meets him, he shall put him to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">If anyone with malice aforethought shoves another or throws something at him intentionally so that he dies</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">or if in hostility he hits him with his fist so that he dies, that person shall be put to death; he is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"'But if without hostility someone suddenly shoves another or throws something at him unintentionally</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">or, without seeing him, drops a stone on him that could kill him, and he dies, then since he was not his enemy and he did not intend to harm him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">the assembly must judge between him and the avenger of blood according to these regulations.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The assembly must protect the one accused of murder from the avenger of blood and send him back to the city of refuge to which he fled. He must stay there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">"'But if the accused ever goes outside the limits of the city of refuge to which he has fled</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">and the avenger of blood finds him outside the city, the avenger of blood may kill the accused without being guilty of murder.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">The accused must stay in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest; only after the death of the high priest may he return to his own property.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">"'These are to be legal requirements for you throughout the generations to come, wherever you live.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">"'Anyone who kills a person is to be put to death as a murderer only on the testimony of witnesses. But no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">"'Do not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer, who deserves to die. He must surely be put to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">"'Do not accept a ransom for anyone who has fled to a city of refuge and so allow him to go back and live on his own land before the death of the high priest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">"'Do not pollute the land where you are. Bloodshed pollutes the land, and atonement cannot be made for the land on which blood has been shed, except by the blood of the one who shed it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Do not defile the land where you live and where I dwell, for I, the LORD, dwell among the Israelites.'"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="36">
<VERS vnumber="1">The family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, who were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph, came and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite families.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">They said, "When the LORD commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our forefathers."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then at the LORD's command Moses gave this order to the Israelites: "What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">This is what the LORD commands for Zelophehad's daughters: They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within the tribal clan of their father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">No inheritance in Israel is to pass from tribe to tribe, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal land inherited from his forefathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father's tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of his fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">No inheritance may pass from tribe to tribe, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So Zelophehad's daughters did as the LORD commanded Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Zelophehad's daughters-Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah-married their cousins on their father's side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father's clan and tribe.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">These are the commands and regulations the LORD gave through Moses to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.</VERS>

</BIBLEBOOK>
<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="5" bname="Deuteronomy" bsname="Deut">
<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the desert east of the Jordan-that is, in the Arabah-opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">(It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the LORD had commanded him concerning them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The LORD our God said to us at Horeb, "You have stayed long enough at this mountain.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land that the LORD swore he would give to your fathers-to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob-and to their descendants after them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">At that time I said to you, "You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The LORD your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as many as the stars in the sky.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">You answered me, "What you propose to do is good."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you-as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">And I charged your judges at that time: Hear the disputes between your brothers and judge fairly, whether the case is between brother Israelites or between one of them and an alien.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of any man, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And at that time I told you everything you were to do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then, as the LORD our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful desert that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then I said to you, "You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">See, the LORD your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your fathers, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then all of you came to me and said, "Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and explored it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, "It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">You grumbled in your tents and said, "The LORD hates us; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Where can we go? Our brothers have made us lose heart. They say, 'The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Then I said to you, "Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">The LORD your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">and in the desert. There you saw how the LORD your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">In spite of this, you did not trust in the LORD your God,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">When the LORD heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">"Not a man of this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your forefathers,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the LORD wholeheartedly."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Because of you the LORD became angry with me also and said, "You shall not enter it, either.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad-they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea. "</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Then you replied, "We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God commanded us." So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">But the LORD said to me, "Tell them, 'Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the LORD's command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">You came back and wept before the LORD, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">And so you stayed in Kadesh many days-all the time you spent there.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then we turned back and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea, as the LORD had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then the LORD said to me,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Give the people these orders: 'You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast desert. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So we went on past our brothers the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then the LORD said to me, "Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">(The Emites used to live there-a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land the LORD gave them as their possession.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And the LORD said, "Now get up and cross the Zered Valley." So we crossed the valley.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The LORD's hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">the LORD said to me,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">(That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">They were a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. The LORD destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The LORD had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor destroyed them and settled in their place.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">From the desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">"Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us-until we cross the Jordan into the land the LORD our God is giving us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">The LORD said to me, "See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">the LORD our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed them-men, women and children. We left no survivors.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The LORD our God gave us all of them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">But in accordance with the command of the LORD our God, you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The LORD said to me, "Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So the LORD our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them-the whole region of Argob, Og's kingdom in Bashan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">We completely destroyed them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying every city-men, women and children.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, towns of Og's kingdom in Bashan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">(Only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaites. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair. )</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">And I gave Gilead to Makir.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea ), below the slopes of Pisgah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">I commanded you at that time: "The LORD your God has given you this land to take possession of it. But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of your brother Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as he has to you, and they too have taken over the land that the LORD your God is giving them, across the Jordan. After that, each of you may go back to the possession I have given you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">At that time I commanded Joshua: "You have seen with your own eyes all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Do not be afraid of them; the LORD your God himself will fight for you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">At that time I pleaded with the LORD:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"O Sovereign LORD, you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan-that fine hill country and Lebanon."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">But because of you the LORD was angry with me and would not listen to me. "That is enough," the LORD said. "Do not speak to me anymore about this matter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">Hear now, O Israel, the decrees and laws I am about to teach you. Follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the LORD your God that I give you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">You saw with your own eyes what the LORD did at Baal Peor. The LORD your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">but all of you who held fast to the LORD your God are still alive today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the LORD my God commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, "Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the LORD our God is near us whenever we pray to him?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them slip from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Remember the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when he said to me, "Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then the LORD spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">And the LORD directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">You saw no form of any kind the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars-all the heavenly array-do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">But as for you, the LORD took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of his inheritance, as you now are.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The LORD was angry with me because of you, and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the LORD your God is giving you as your inheritance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Be careful not to forget the covenant of the LORD your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the LORD your God has forbidden.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time-if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil in the eyes of the LORD your God and provoking him to anger,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the LORD will drive you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="32">Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created man on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of?</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="34">Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation, by testings, by miraculous signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides him there is no other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Because he loved your forefathers and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="5">This is what you are to do to them: Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols in the fire.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your fathers had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the LORD your God disciplines you.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="8">a land with wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and honey;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing; a land where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the LORD your God for the good land he has given you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Be careful that you do not forget the LORD your God, failing to observe his commands, his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="15">He led you through the vast and dreadful desert, that thirsty and waterless land, with its venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water out of hard rock.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He gave you manna to eat in the desert, something your fathers had never known, to humble and to test you so that in the end it might go well with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">You may say to yourself, "My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me."</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="19">If you ever forget the LORD your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">Hear, O Israel. You are now about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities that have walls up to the sky.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">But be assured today that the LORD your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them; he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly, as the LORD has promised you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">After the LORD your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, "The LORD has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness." No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is going to drive them out before you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the LORD your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Remember this and never forget how you provoked the LORD your God to anger in the desert. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">At Horeb you aroused the LORD's wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The LORD gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the LORD proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then the LORD told me, "Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made a cast idol for themselves."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And the LORD said to me, "I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the LORD your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then once again I fell prostrate before the LORD for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the LORD's sight and so provoking him to anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">I feared the anger and wrath of the LORD, for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again the LORD listened to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And the LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">You also made the LORD angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">And when the LORD sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, "Go up and take possession of the land I have given you." But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. You did not trust him or obey him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">You have been rebellious against the LORD ever since I have known you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">I lay prostrate before the LORD those forty days and forty nights because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">I prayed to the LORD and said, "O Sovereign LORD, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, 'Because the LORD was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the desert.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm."</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">At that time the LORD said to me, "Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden chest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to put them in the chest."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The LORD wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the LORD gave them to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the LORD commanded me, and they are there now.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">(The Israelites traveled from the wells of the Jaakanites to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name, as they still do today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their brothers; the LORD is their inheritance, as the LORD your God told them.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and nights, as I did the first time, and the LORD listened to me at this time also. It was not his will to destroy you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Go," the LORD said to me, "and lead the people on their way, so that they may enter and possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">And now, O Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="14">To the LORD your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Yet the LORD set his affection on your forefathers and loved them, and he chose you, their descendants, above all the nations, as it is today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the alien, giving him food and clothing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">And you are to love those who are aliens, for you yourselves were aliens in Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Fear the LORD your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt, both to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">what he did to the Egyptian army, to its horses and chariots, how he overwhelmed them with the waters of the Red Sea as they were pursuing you, and how the LORD brought lasting ruin on them.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="15">I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Be careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then the LORD's anger will burn against you, and he will shut the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce, and you will soon perish from the good land the LORD is giving you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="22">If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow-to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways and to hold fast to him-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Every place where you set your foot will be yours: Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the western sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">No man will be able to stand against you. The LORD your God, as he promised you, will put the terror and fear of you on the whole land, wherever you go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">the blessing if you obey the commands of the LORD your God that I am giving you today;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">the curse if you disobey the commands of the LORD your God and turn from the way that I command you today by following other gods, which you have not known.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">When the LORD your God has brought you into the land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim on Mount Gerizim the blessings, and on Mount Ebal the curses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">As you know, these mountains are across the Jordan, west of the road, toward the setting sun, near the great trees of Moreh, in the territory of those Canaanites living in the Arabah in the vicinity of Gilgal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">You are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you. When you have taken it over and are living there,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">be sure that you obey all the decrees and laws I am setting before you today.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
<VERS vnumber="1">These are the decrees and laws you must be careful to follow in the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess-as long as you live in the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains and on the hills and under every spreading tree where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">You must not worship the LORD your God in their way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But you are to seek the place the LORD your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">There, in the presence of the LORD your God, you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to, because the LORD your God has blessed you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">You are not to do as we do here today, everyone as he sees fit,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the LORD your God is giving you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then to the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name-there you are to bring everything I command you: your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice possessions you have vowed to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">And there rejoice before the LORD your God, you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levites from your towns, who have no allotment or inheritance of their own.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Offer them only at the place the LORD will choose in one of your tribes, and there observe everything I command you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Nevertheless, you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want, as if it were gazelle or deer, according to the blessing the LORD your God gives you. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">You must not eat in your own towns the tithe of your grain and new wine and oil, or the firstborn of your herds and flocks, or whatever you have vowed to give, or your freewill offerings or special gifts.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Instead, you are to eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place the LORD your God will choose-you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levites from your towns-and you are to rejoice before the LORD your God in everything you put your hand to.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">When the LORD your God has enlarged your territory as he promised you, and you crave meat and say, "I would like some meat," then you may eat as much of it as you want.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">If the place where the LORD your God chooses to put his Name is too far away from you, you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you, and in your own towns you may eat as much of them as you want.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Eat them as you would gazelle or deer. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">But be sure you do not eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">You must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">But take your consecrated things and whatever you have vowed to give, and go to the place the LORD will choose.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD your God, both the meat and the blood. The blood of your sacrifices must be poured beside the altar of the LORD your God, but you may eat the meat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Be careful to obey all these regulations I am giving you, so that it may always go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the LORD your God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">The LORD your God will cut off before you the nations you are about to invade and dispossess. But when you have driven them out and settled in their land,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">and after they have been destroyed before you, be careful not to be ensnared by inquiring about their gods, saying, "How do these nations serve their gods? We will do the same."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">You must not worship the LORD your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">See that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from it.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
<VERS vnumber="1">If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and announces to you a miraculous sign or wonder,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The LORD your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">It is the LORD your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">That prophet or dreamer must be put to death, because he preached rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; he has tried to turn you from the way the LORD your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, "Let us go and worship other gods" (gods that neither you nor your fathers have known,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="12">If you hear it said about one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you to live in</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">that wicked men have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray, saying, "Let us go and worship other gods" (gods you have not known),</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="16">Gather all the plunder of the town into the middle of the public square and completely burn the town and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. It is to remain a ruin forever, never to be rebuilt.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="7">However, of those that chew the cud or that have a split hoof completely divided you may not eat the camel, the rabbit or the coney. Although they chew the cud, they do not have a split hoof; they are ceremonially unclean for you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The pig is also unclean; although it has a split hoof, it does not chew the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Of all the creatures living in the water, you may eat any that has fins and scales.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But anything that does not have fins and scales you may not eat; for you it is unclean.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="21">Do not eat anything you find already dead. You may give it to an alien living in any of your towns, and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. But you are a people holy to the LORD your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Eat the tithe of your grain, new wine and oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the presence of the LORD your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name, so that you may learn to revere the LORD your God always.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">But if that place is too distant and you have been blessed by the LORD your God and cannot carry your tithe (because the place where the LORD will choose to put his Name is so far away),</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="26">Use the silver to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish. Then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
<VERS vnumber="1">At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel the loan he has made to his fellow Israelite. He shall not require payment from his fellow Israelite or brother, because the LORD's time for canceling debts has been proclaimed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your brother owes you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">However, there should be no poor among you, for in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will richly bless you,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">if only you fully obey the LORD your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">For the LORD your God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">If there is a poor man among your brothers in any of the towns of the land that the LORD your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward your poor brother.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Rather be openhanded and freely lend him whatever he needs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: "The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near," so that you do not show ill will toward your needy brother and give him nothing. He may then appeal to the LORD against you, and you will be found guilty of sin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Give generously to him and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your brothers and toward the poor and needy in your land.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="16">But if your servant says to you, "I do not want to leave you," because he loves you and your family and is well off with you,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">then take an awl and push it through his ear lobe into the door, and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your maidservant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because his service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Set apart for the LORD your God every firstborn male of your herds and flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your oxen to work, and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="18">Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the LORD your God is giving you, and they shall judge the people fairly.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="5">For instance, a man may go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and as he swings his ax to fell a tree, the head may fly off and hit his neighbor and kill him. That man may flee to one of these cities and save his life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage, overtake him if the distance is too great, and kill him even though he is not deserving of death, since he did it to his neighbor without malice aforethought.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">This is why I command you to set aside for yourselves three cities.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">If the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he promised on oath to your forefathers, and gives you the whole land he promised them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">because you carefully follow all these laws I command you today-to love the LORD your God and to walk always in his ways-then you are to set aside three more cities.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land, which the LORD your God is giving you as your inheritance, and so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But if a man hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him, assaults and kills him, and then flees to one of these cities,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">the elders of his town shall send for him, bring him back from the city, and hand him over to the avenger of blood to die.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="15">One witness is not enough to convict a man accused of any crime or offense he may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse a man of a crime,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">the two men involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the LORD before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The judges must make a thorough investigation, and if the witness proves to be a liar, giving false testimony against his brother,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">then do to him as he intended to do to his brother. You must purge the evil from among you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid, and never again will such an evil thing be done among you.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="19">When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees of the field people, that you should besiege them?</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="4">The fruit of your womb will be blessed, and the crops of your land and the young of your livestock-the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Your basket and your kneading trough will be blessed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The LORD will grant that the enemies who rise up against you will be defeated before you. They will come at you from one direction but flee from you in seven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The LORD will send a blessing on your barns and on everything you put your hand to. The LORD your God will bless you in the land he is giving you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The LORD will establish you as his holy people, as he promised you on oath, if you keep the commands of the LORD your God and walk in his ways.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then all the peoples on earth will see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they will fear you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The LORD will grant you abundant prosperity-in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your ground-in the land he swore to your forefathers to give you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The LORD will open the heavens, the storehouse of his bounty, to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The LORD will make you the head, not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the LORD your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the bottom.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Do not turn aside from any of the commands I give you today, to the right or to the left, following other gods and serving them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">However, if you do not obey the LORD your God and do not carefully follow all his commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come upon you and overtake you:</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="23">The sky over your head will be bronze, the ground beneath you iron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The LORD will turn the rain of your country into dust and powder; it will come down from the skies until you are destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven, and you will become a thing of horror to all the kingdoms on earth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Your carcasses will be food for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and there will be no one to frighten them away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">The LORD will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, festering sores and the itch, from which you cannot be cured.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">The LORD will afflict you with madness, blindness and confusion of mind.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="30">You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and ravish her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it. Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will rescue them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and you will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day, powerless to lift a hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">The sights you see will drive you mad.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">The LORD will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">The LORD will drive you and the king you set over you to a nation unknown to you or your fathers. There you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">You will become a thing of horror and an object of scorn and ridicule to all the nations where the LORD will drive you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil, because the olives will drop off.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="43">The alien who lives among you will rise above you higher and higher, but you will sink lower and lower.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">He will lend to you, but you will not lend to him. He will be the head, but you will be the tail.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">All these curses will come upon you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the LORD your God and observe the commands and decrees he gave you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants forever.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">Because you did not serve the LORD your God joyfully and gladly in the time of prosperity,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will serve the enemies the LORD sends against you. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">The LORD will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language you will not understand,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="52">They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down. They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the LORD your God is giving you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="53">Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the LORD your God has given you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="54">Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="55">and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="56">The most gentle and sensitive woman among you-so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot-will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="58">If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name-the LORD your God-</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="60">He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="61">The LORD will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="62">You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the LORD your God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="63">Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="64">Then the LORD will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods-gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="65">Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="66">You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="67">In the morning you will say, "If only it were evening!" and in the evening, "If only it were morning!"-because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="68">The LORD will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="29">
<VERS vnumber="1">These are the terms of the covenant the LORD commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Horeb.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them: Your eyes have seen all that the LORD did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials and to all his land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">With your own eyes you saw those great trials, those miraculous signs and great wonders.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But to this day the LORD has not given you a mind that understands or eyes that see or ears that hear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">During the forty years that I led you through the desert, your clothes did not wear out, nor did the sandals on your feet.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the LORD your God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to fight against us, but we defeated them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Carefully follow the terms of this covenant, so that you may prosper in everything you do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">All of you are standing today in the presence of the LORD your God-your leaders and chief men, your elders and officials, and all the other men of Israel,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">together with your children and your wives, and the aliens living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the LORD your God, a covenant the LORD is making with you this day and sealing with an oath,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">to confirm you this day as his people, that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">I am making this covenant, with its oath, not only with you</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">who are standing here with us today in the presence of the LORD our God but also with those who are not here today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the LORD our God to go and worship the gods of those nations; make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When such a person hears the words of this oath, he invokes a blessing on himself and therefore thinks, "I will be safe, even though I persist in going my own way." This will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The LORD will never be willing to forgive him; his wrath and zeal will burn against that man. All the curses written in this book will fall upon him, and the LORD will blot out his name from under heaven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The LORD will single him out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the LORD has afflicted it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur-nothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it. It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in fierce anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">All the nations will ask: "Why has the LORD done this to this land? Why this fierce, burning anger?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">And the answer will be: "It is because this people abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, the covenant he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">They went off and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, gods they did not know, gods he had not given them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Therefore the LORD's anger burned against this land, so that he brought on it all the curses written in this book.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">In furious anger and in great wrath the LORD uprooted them from their land and thrust them into another land, as it is now."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="30">
<VERS vnumber="1">When all these blessings and curses I have set before you come upon you and you take them to heart wherever the LORD your God disperses you among the nations,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">and when you and your children return to the LORD your God and obey him with all your heart and with all your soul according to everything I command you today,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">then the LORD your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where he scattered you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the LORD your God will gather you and bring you back.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He will bring you to the land that belonged to your fathers, and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The LORD your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul, and live.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The LORD your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">You will again obey the LORD and follow all his commands I am giving you today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then the LORD your God will make you most prosperous in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your land. The LORD will again delight in you and make you prosperous, just as he delighted in your fathers,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">if you obey the LORD your God and keep his commands and decrees that are written in this Book of the Law and turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. The Offer of Life or Death</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">It is not up in heaven, so that you have to ask, "Who will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you have to ask, "Who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">See, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and destruction.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">For I command you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commands, decrees and laws; then you will live and increase, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">and that you may love the LORD your God, listen to his voice, and hold fast to him. For the LORD is your life, and he will give you many years in the land he swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="31">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Moses went out and spoke these words to all Israel:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"I am now a hundred and twenty years old and I am no longer able to lead you. The LORD has said to me, 'You shall not cross the Jordan.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The LORD your God himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua also will cross over ahead of you, as the LORD said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">And the LORD will do to them what he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, whom he destroyed along with their land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The LORD will deliver them to you, and you must do to them all that I have commanded you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people into the land that the LORD swore to their forefathers to give them, and you must divide it among them as their inheritance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The LORD himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then Moses commanded them: "At the end of every seven years, in the year for canceling debts, during the Feast of Tabernacles,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God at the place he will choose, you shall read this law before them in their hearing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Assemble the people-men, women and children, and the aliens living in your towns-so they can listen and learn to fear the LORD your God and follow carefully all the words of this law.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Their children, who do not know this law, must hear it and learn to fear the LORD your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The LORD said to Moses, "Now the day of your death is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting, where I will commission him." So Moses and Joshua came and presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then the LORD appeared at the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over the entrance to the Tent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">And the LORD said to Moses: "You are going to rest with your fathers, and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake me and break the covenant I made with them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">On that day I will become angry with them and forsake them; I will hide my face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and difficulties will come upon them, and on that day they will ask, 'Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is not with us?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And I will certainly hide my face on that day because of all their wickedness in turning to other gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Now write down for yourselves this song and teach it to the Israelites and have them sing it, so that it may be a witness for me against them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the land I promised on oath to their forefathers, and when they eat their fill and thrive, they will turn to other gods and worship them, rejecting me and breaking my covenant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">And when many disasters and difficulties come upon them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they are disposed to do, even before I bring them into the land I promised them on oath."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The LORD gave this command to Joshua son of Nun: "Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them on oath, and I myself will be with you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">"Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God. There it will remain as a witness against you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against the LORD while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials, so that I can speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to testify against them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall upon you because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD and provoke him to anger by what your hands have made."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">And Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel:</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="32">
<VERS vnumber="1">Listen, O heavens, and I will speak; hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Let my teaching fall like rain and my words descend like dew, like showers on new grass, like abundant rain on tender plants.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I will proclaim the name of the LORD. Oh, praise the greatness of our God!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">They have acted corruptly toward him; to their shame they are no longer his children, but a warped and crooked generation.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Is this the way you repay the LORD, O foolish and unwise people? Is he not your Father, your Creator, who made you and formed you?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Remember the days of old; consider the generations long past. Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders, and they will explain to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided all mankind, he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">For the LORD's portion is his people, Jacob his allotted inheritance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">In a desert land he found him, in a barren and howling waste. He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his eye,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them on its pinions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The LORD alone led him; no foreign god was with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields. He nourished him with honey from the rock, and with oil from the flinty crag,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">with curds and milk from herd and flock and with fattened lambs and goats, with choice rams of Bashan and the finest kernels of wheat. You drank the foaming blood of the grape.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; filled with food, he became heavy and sleek. He abandoned the God who made him and rejected the Rock his Savior.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">They sacrificed to demons, which are not God- gods they had not known, gods that recently appeared, gods your fathers did not fear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">You deserted the Rock, who fathered you; you forgot the God who gave you birth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The LORD saw this and rejected them because he was angered by his sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"I will hide my face from them," he said, "and see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children who are unfaithful.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">They made me jealous by what is no god and angered me with their worthless idols. I will make them envious by those who are not a people; I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">For a fire has been kindled by my wrath, one that burns to the realm of death below. It will devour the earth and its harvests and set afire the foundations of the mountains.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"I will heap calamities upon them and spend my arrows against them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">I will send wasting famine against them, consuming pestilence and deadly plague; I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts, the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">In the street the sword will make them childless; in their homes terror will reign. Young men and young women will perish, infants and gray-haired men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">I said I would scatter them and blot out their memory from mankind,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy, lest the adversary misunderstand and say, 'Our hand has triumphed; the LORD has not done all this.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">They are a nation without sense, there is no discernment in them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">If only they were wise and would understand this and discern what their end will be!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">How could one man chase a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the LORD had given them up?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">For their rock is not like our Rock, as even our enemies concede.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are filled with poison, and their clusters with bitterness.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="36">The LORD will judge his people and have compassion on his servants when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left, slave or free.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">He will say: "Now where are their gods, the rock they took refuge in,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="39">"See now that I myself am He! There is no god besides me. I put to death and I bring to life, I have wounded and I will heal, and no one can deliver out of my hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">I lift my hand to heaven and declare: As surely as I live forever,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="44">Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">he said to them, "Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">They are not just idle words for you-they are your life. By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">On that same day the LORD told Moses,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">"Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo in Moab, across from Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am giving the Israelites as their own possession.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">There on the mountain that you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">This is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin and because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="52">Therefore, you will see the land only from a distance; you will not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="33">
<VERS vnumber="1">This is the blessing that Moses the man of God pronounced on the Israelites before his death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He said: "The LORD came from Sinai and dawned over them from Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran. He came with myriads of holy ones from the south, from his mountain slopes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Surely it is you who love the people; all the holy ones are in your hand. At your feet they all bow down, and from you receive instruction,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">the law that Moses gave us, the possession of the assembly of Jacob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He was king over Jeshurun when the leaders of the people assembled, along with the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Let Reuben live and not die, nor his men be few."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And this he said about Judah: "Hear, O LORD, the cry of Judah; bring him to his people. With his own hands he defends his cause. Oh, be his help against his foes!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">About Levi he said: "Your Thummim and Urim belong to the man you favored. You tested him at Massah; you contended with him at the waters of Meribah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He said of his father and mother, 'I have no regard for them.' He did not recognize his brothers or acknowledge his own children, but he watched over your word and guarded your covenant.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">He teaches your precepts to Jacob and your law to Israel. He offers incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Bless all his skills, O LORD, and be pleased with the work of his hands. Smite the loins of those who rise up against him; strike his foes till they rise no more."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">About Benjamin he said: "Let the beloved of the LORD rest secure in him, for he shields him all day long, and the one the LORD loves rests between his shoulders."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">About Joseph he said: "May the LORD bless his land with the precious dew from heaven above and with the deep waters that lie below;</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="15">with the choicest gifts of the ancient mountains and the fruitfulness of the everlasting hills;</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="18">About Zebulun he said: "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and you, Issachar, in your tents.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">They will summon peoples to the mountain and there offer sacrifices of righteousness; they will feast on the abundance of the seas, on the treasures hidden in the sand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">About Gad he said: "Blessed is he who enlarges Gad's domain! Gad lives there like a lion, tearing at arm or head.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He chose the best land for himself; the leader's portion was kept for him. When the heads of the people assembled, he carried out the LORD's righteous will, and his judgments concerning Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">About Dan he said: "Dan is a lion's cub, springing out of Bashan."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">About Naphtali he said: "Naphtali is abounding with the favor of the LORD and is full of his blessing; he will inherit southward to the lake."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">About Asher he said: "Most blessed of sons is Asher; let him be favored by his brothers, and let him bathe his feet in oil.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="34">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the LORD showed him the whole land-from Gilead to Dan,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western sea,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the LORD said to him, "This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob when I said, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">And Moses the servant of the LORD died there in Moab, as the LORD had said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He buried him in Moab, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what the LORD had commanded Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">who did all those miraculous signs and wonders the LORD sent him to do in Egypt-to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land.</VERS>

<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="6" bname="Joshua" bsname="Josh">
<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, the LORD said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' aide:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them-to the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates-all the Hittite country-to the Great Sea on the west.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So Joshua ordered the officers of the people:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Go through the camp and tell the people, 'Get your supplies ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you for your own.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">But to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"Remember the command that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you: 'The LORD your God is giving you rest and has granted you this land.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, fully armed, must cross over ahead of your brothers. You are to help your brothers</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">until the LORD gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then they answered Joshua, "Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you as he was with Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey your words, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. "Go, look over the land," he said, "especially Jericho." So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The king of Jericho was told, "Look! Some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: "Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, the men left. I don't know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">(But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">and said to them, "I know that the LORD has given this land to you and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">We have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When we heard of it, our hearts melted and everyone's courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will save us from death."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"Our lives for your lives!" the men assured her. "If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the LORD gives us the land."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Now she had said to them, "Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The men said to her, "This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">If anyone goes outside your house into the street, his blood will be on his own head; we will not be responsible. As for anyone who is in the house with you, his blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"Agreed," she replied. "Let it be as you say." So she sent them away and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">They said to Joshua, "The LORD has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">After three days the officers went throughout the camp,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">giving orders to the people: "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests, who are Levites, carrying it, you are to move out from your positions and follow it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about a thousand yards between you and the ark; do not go near it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Joshua told the people, "Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do amazing things among you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Joshua said to the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people." So they took it up and went ahead of them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant: 'When you reach the edge of the Jordan's waters, go and stand in the river.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Joshua said to the Israelites, "Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Now then, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the LORD -the Lord of all the earth-set foot in the Jordan, its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water's edge,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea ) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan from right where the priests stood and to carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">and said to them, "Go over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, 'What do these stones mean?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the LORD had told Joshua; and they carried them over with them to their camp, where they put them down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are there to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the LORD had commanded Joshua was done by the people, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried over,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">and as soon as all of them had crossed, the ark of the LORD and the priests came to the other side while the people watched.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over, armed, in front of the Israelites, as Moses had directed them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the LORD to the plains of Jericho for war.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">That day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they revered him all the days of his life, just as they had revered Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then the LORD said to Joshua,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Command the priests carrying the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So Joshua commanded the priests, "Come up out of the Jordan."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And the priests came up out of the river carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD. No sooner had they set their feet on the dry ground than the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and ran at flood stage as before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He said to the Israelites, "In the future when your descendants ask their fathers, 'What do these stones mean?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">tell them, 'Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">For the LORD your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over. The LORD your God did to the Jordan just what he had done to the Red Sea when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the LORD is powerful and so that you might always fear the LORD your God."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the LORD had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until we had crossed over, their hearts melted and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Now this is why he did so: All those who came out of Egypt-all the men of military age-died in the desert on the way after leaving Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">All the people that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the desert during the journey from Egypt had not.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The Israelites had moved about in the desert forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the LORD. For the LORD had sworn to them that they would not see the land that he had solemnly promised their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And after the whole nation had been circumcised, they remained where they were in camp until they were healed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." So the place has been called Gilgal to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The manna stopped the day after they ate this food from the land; there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, but that year they ate of the produce of Canaan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, "Are you for us or for our enemies?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"Neither," he replied, "but as commander of the army of the LORD I have now come." Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence, and asked him, "What message does my Lord have for his servant?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The commander of the LORD's army replied, "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did so.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then the LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have all the people give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the people will go up, every man straight in."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant of the LORD and have seven priests carry trumpets in front of it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And he ordered the people, "Advance! March around the city, with the armed guard going ahead of the ark of the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the LORD went forward, blowing their trumpets, and the ark of the LORD's covenant followed them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But Joshua had commanded the people, "Do not give a war cry, do not raise your voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So he had the ark of the LORD carried around the city, circling it once. Then the people returned to camp and spent the night there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward, marching before the ark of the LORD and blowing the trumpets. The armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets kept sounding.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">On the seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner, except that on that day they circled the city seven times.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the people, "Shout! For the LORD has given you the city!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The city and all that is in it are to be devoted to the LORD. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But keep away from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the LORD and must go into his treasury."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">When the trumpets sounded, the people shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the people gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so every man charged straight in, and they took the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">They devoted the city to the LORD and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it-men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the prostitute's house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD's house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho-and she lives among the Israelites to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: "Cursed before the LORD is the man who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho: "At the cost of his firstborn son will he lay its foundations; at the cost of his youngest will he set up its gates."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">But the Israelites acted unfaithfully in regard to the devoted things; Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of them. So the LORD's anger burned against Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, "Go up and spy out the region." So the men went up and spied out Ai.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When they returned to Joshua, they said, "Not all the people will have to go up against Ai. Send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary all the people, for only a few men are there."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So about three thousand men went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">who killed about thirty-six of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted and became like water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the LORD, remaining there till evening. The elders of Israel did the same, and sprinkled dust on their heads.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And Joshua said, "Ah, Sovereign LORD, why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its enemies?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will you do for your own great name?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The LORD said to Joshua, "Stand up! What are you doing down on your face?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, 'Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow; for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: That which is devoted is among you, O Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"'In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe that the LORD takes shall come forward clan by clan; the clan that the LORD takes shall come forward family by family; and the family that the LORD takes shall come forward man by man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He who is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire, along with all that belongs to him. He has violated the covenant of the LORD and has done a disgraceful thing in Israel!'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was taken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The clans of Judah came forward, and he took the Zerahites. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zimri was taken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Joshua had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and give him the praise. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Achan replied, "It is true! I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I have done:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold wedge, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Joshua said, "Why have you brought this trouble on us? The LORD will bring trouble on you today." Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from his fierce anger. Therefore that place has been called the Valley of Achor ever since.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. For I have delivered into your hands the king of Ai, his people, his city and his land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">with these orders: "Listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city. Don't go very far from it. All of you be on the alert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">I and all those with me will advance on the city, and when the men come out against us, as they did before, we will flee from them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, 'They are running away from us as they did before.' So when we flee from them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. The LORD your God will give it into your hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do what the LORD has commanded. See to it; you have my orders."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai-but Joshua spent that night with the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Early the next morning Joshua mustered his men, and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to Ai.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">They had the soldiers take up their positions-all those in the camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">When the king of Ai saw this, he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them, and they fled toward the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">All the men of Ai were called to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand, for into your hand I will deliver the city." So Joshua held out his javelin toward Ai.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising against the sky, but they had no chance to escape in any direction, for the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the desert had turned back against their pursuers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from the city, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The men of the ambush also came out of the city against them, so that they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down, leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the desert where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Twelve thousand men and women fell that day-all the people of Ai.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed all who lived in Ai.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the LORD had instructed Joshua.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">So Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolate place to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">He hung the king of Ai on a tree and left him there until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered them to take his body from the tree and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And they raised a large pile of rocks over it, which remains to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses-an altar of uncut stones, on which no iron tool had been used. On it they offered to the LORD burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship offerings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua copied on stones the law of Moses, which he had written.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">All Israel, aliens and citizens alike, with their elders, officials and judges, were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD, facing those who carried it-the priests, who were Levites. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had formerly commanded when he gave instructions to bless the people of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Afterward, Joshua read all the words of the law-the blessings and the curses-just as it is written in the Book of the Law.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel, including the women and children, and the aliens who lived among them.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things-those in the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the entire coast of the Great Sea as far as Lebanon (the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites)-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">they came together to make war against Joshua and Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">However, when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">they resorted to a ruse: They went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded with worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The men put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, "We have come from a distant country; make a treaty with us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The men of Israel said to the Hivites, "But perhaps you live near us. How then can we make a treaty with you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"We are your servants," they said to Joshua. But Joshua asked, "Who are you and where do you come from?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">They answered: "Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the LORD your God. For we have heard reports of him: all that he did in Egypt,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan-Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">And our elders and all those living in our country said to us, 'Take provisions for your journey; go and meet them and say to them, "We are your servants; make a treaty with us."'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But now see how dry and moldy it is.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And these wineskins that we filled were new, but see how cracked they are. And our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very long journey."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The men of Israel sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Three days after they made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites heard that they were neighbors, living near them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So the Israelites set out and on the third day came to their cities: Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. The whole assembly grumbled against the leaders,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">but all the leaders answered, "We have given them our oath by the LORD, the God of Israel, and we cannot touch them now.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, so that wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">They continued, "Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community." So the leaders' promise to them was kept.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, "Why did you deceive us by saying, 'We live a long way from you,' while actually you live near us?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">You are now under a curse: You will never cease to serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">They answered Joshua, "Your servants were clearly told how the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you. So we feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we did this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">We are now in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">So Joshua saved them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">That day he made the Gibeonites woodcutters and water carriers for the community and for the altar of the LORD at the place the LORD would choose. And that is what they are to this day.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and totally destroyed it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with Israel and were living near them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"Come up and help me attack Gibeon," he said, "because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then the five kings of the Amorites-the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon-joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: "Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them; I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will be able to withstand you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The LORD threw them into confusion before Israel, who defeated them in a great victory at Gibeon. Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon and cut them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">On the day the LORD gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the LORD in the presence of Israel: "O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the LORD listened to a man. Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">he said, "Roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave, and post some men there to guard it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">But don't stop! Pursue your enemies, attack them from the rear and don't let them reach their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So Joshua and the Israelites destroyed them completely-almost to a man-but the few who were left reached their fortified cities.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The whole army then returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one uttered a word against the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So they brought the five kings out of the cave-the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him, "Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings." So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then Joshua struck and killed the kings and hung them on five trees, and they were left hanging on the trees until evening.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">At sunset Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding. At the mouth of the cave they placed large rocks, which are there to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">That day Joshua took Makkedah. He put the city and its king to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it. He left no survivors. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">The LORD also gave that city and its king into Israel's hand. The city and everyone in it Joshua put to the sword. He left no survivors there. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish; he took up positions against it and attacked it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">The LORD handed Lachish over to Israel, and Joshua took it on the second day. The city and everyone in it he put to the sword, just as he had done to Libnah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Meanwhile, Horam king of Gezer had come up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army-until no survivors were left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Lachish to Eglon; they took up positions against it and attacked it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">They captured it that same day and put it to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it, just as they had done to Lachish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">They took the city and put it to the sword, together with its king, its villages and everyone in it. They left no survivors. Just as at Eglon, they totally destroyed it and everyone in it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned around and attacked Debir.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">They took the city, its king and its villages, and put them to the sword. Everyone in it they totally destroyed. They left no survivors. They did to Debir and its king as they had done to Libnah and its king and to Hebron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">So Joshua subdued the whole region, including the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills and the mountain slopes, together with all their kings. He left no survivors. He totally destroyed all who breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Joshua subdued them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza and from the whole region of Goshen to Gibeon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">All these kings and their lands Joshua conquered in one campaign, because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Jabin king of Hazor heard of this, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, to the kings of Shimron and Acshaph,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">and to the northern kings who were in the mountains, in the Arabah south of Kinnereth, in the western foothills and in Naphoth Dor on the west;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites and Jebusites in the hill country; and to the Hivites below Hermon in the region of Mizpah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">They came out with all their troops and a large number of horses and chariots-a huge army, as numerous as the sand on the seashore.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">All these kings joined forces and made camp together at the Waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them, because by this time tomorrow I will hand all of them over to Israel, slain. You are to hamstring their horses and burn their chariots."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So Joshua and his whole army came against them suddenly at the Waters of Merom and attacked them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">and the LORD gave them into the hand of Israel. They defeated them and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon, to Misrephoth Maim, and to the Valley of Mizpah on the east, until no survivors were left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Joshua did to them as the LORD had directed: He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and put its king to the sword. (Hazor had been the head of all these kingdoms.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Everyone in it they put to the sword. They totally destroyed them, not sparing anything that breathed, and he burned up Hazor itself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Joshua took all these royal cities and their kings and put them to the sword. He totally destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds-except Hazor, which Joshua burned.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The Israelites carried off for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities, but all the people they put to the sword until they completely destroyed them, not sparing anyone that breathed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">As the LORD commanded his servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did it; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So Joshua took this entire land: the hill country, all the Negev, the whole region of Goshen, the western foothills, the Arabah and the mountains of Israel with their foothills,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, to Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and struck them down, putting them to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Except for the Hivites living in Gibeon, not one city made a treaty of peace with the Israelites, who took them all in battle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">For it was the LORD himself who hardened their hearts to wage war against Israel, so that he might destroy them totally, exterminating them without mercy, as the LORD had commanded Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">At that time Joshua went and destroyed the Anakites from the hill country: from Hebron, Debir and Anab, from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua totally destroyed them and their towns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">No Anakites were left in Israelite territory; only in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod did any survive.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So Joshua took the entire land, just as the LORD had directed Moses, and he gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal divisions. Then the land had rest from war.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="3">from the Shihor River on the east of Egypt to the territory of Ekron on the north, all of it counted as Canaanite (the territory of the five Philistine rulers in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron-that of the Avvites);</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="6">"As for all the inhabitants of the mountain regions from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, that is, all the Sidonians, I myself will drive them out before the Israelites. Be sure to allocate this land to Israel for an inheritance, as I have instructed you,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="8">The other half of Manasseh, the Reubenites and the Gadites had received the inheritance that Moses had given them east of the Jordan, as he, the servant of the LORD, had assigned it to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">It extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the middle of the gorge, and included the whole plateau of Medeba as far as Dibon,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="13">But the Israelites did not drive out the people of Geshur and Maacah, so they continue to live among the Israelites to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">But to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance, since the offerings made by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as he promised them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">This is what Moses had given to the tribe of Reuben, clan by clan:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The territory from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the middle of the gorge, and the whole plateau past Medeba</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="22">In addition to those slain in battle, the Israelites had put to the sword Balaam son of Beor, who practiced divination.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The boundary of the Reubenites was the bank of the Jordan. These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the Reubenites, clan by clan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">This is what Moses had given to the tribe of Gad, clan by clan:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The territory of Jazer, all the towns of Gilead and half the Ammonite country as far as Aroer, near Rabbah;</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="28">These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the Gadites, clan by clan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">This is what Moses had given to the half-tribe of Manasseh, that is, to half the family of the descendants of Manasseh, clan by clan:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">The territory extending from Mahanaim and including all of Bashan, the entire realm of Og king of Bashan-all the settlements of Jair in Bashan, sixty towns,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei (the royal cities of Og in Bashan). This was for the descendants of Makir son of Manasseh-for half of the sons of Makir, clan by clan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">This is the inheritance Moses had given when he was in the plains of Moab across the Jordan east of Jericho.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">But to the tribe of Levi, Moses had given no inheritance; the LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he promised them.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now these are the areas the Israelites received as an inheritance in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel allotted to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Their inheritances were assigned by lot to the nine-and-a-half tribes, as the LORD had commanded through Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Moses had granted the two-and-a-half tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan but had not granted the Levites an inheritance among the rest,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">for the sons of Joseph had become two tribes-Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites received no share of the land but only towns to live in, with pasturelands for their flocks and herds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So the Israelites divided the land, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Now the men of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea about you and me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. And I brought him back a report according to my convictions,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">but my brothers who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt with fear. I, however, followed the LORD my God wholeheartedly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So on that day Moses swore to me, 'The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children forever, because you have followed the LORD my God wholeheartedly.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Now then, just as the LORD promised, he has kept me alive for forty-five years since the time he said this to Moses, while Israel moved about in the desert. So here I am today, eighty-five years old!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I'm just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Now give me this hill country that the LORD promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified, but, the LORD helping me, I will drive them out just as he said."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the LORD, the God of Israel, wholeheartedly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">(Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba after Arba, who was the greatest man among the Anakites.) Then the land had rest from war.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
<VERS vnumber="1">The allotment for Joseph began at the Jordan of Jericho, east of the waters of Jericho, and went up from there through the desert into the hill country of Bethel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz), crossed over to the territory of the Arkites in Ataroth,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the region of Lower Beth Horon and on to Gezer, ending at the sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So Manasseh and Ephraim, the descendants of Joseph, received their inheritance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">This was the territory of Ephraim, clan by clan: The boundary of their inheritance went from Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">and continued to the sea. From Micmethath on the north it curved eastward to Taanath Shiloh, passing by it to Janoah on the east.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">From Tappuah the border went west to the Kanah Ravine and ended at the sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Ephraimites, clan by clan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">It also included all the towns and their villages that were set aside for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">They did not dislodge the Canaanites living in Gezer; to this day the Canaanites live among the people of Ephraim but are required to do forced labor.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
<VERS vnumber="1">This was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Joseph's firstborn, that is, for Makir, Manasseh's firstborn. Makir was the ancestor of the Gileadites, who had received Gilead and Bashan because the Makirites were great soldiers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So this allotment was for the rest of the people of Manasseh-the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher and Shemida. These are the other male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph by their clans.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons but only daughters, whose names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">They went to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders and said, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers." So Joshua gave them an inheritance along with the brothers of their father, according to the LORD's command.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Manasseh's share consisted of ten tracts of land besides Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">because the daughters of the tribe of Manasseh received an inheritance among the sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The territory of Manasseh extended from Asher to Micmethath east of Shechem. The boundary ran southward from there to include the people living at En Tappuah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">(Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah itself, on the boundary of Manasseh, belonged to the Ephraimites.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then the boundary continued south to the Kanah Ravine. There were towns belonging to Ephraim lying among the towns of Manasseh, but the boundary of Manasseh was the northern side of the ravine and ended at the sea.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">On the south the land belonged to Ephraim, on the north to Manasseh. The territory of Manasseh reached the sea and bordered Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh also had Beth Shan, Ibleam and the people of Dor, Endor, Taanach and Megiddo, together with their surrounding settlements (the third in the list is Naphoth ).</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Yet the Manassites were not able to occupy these towns, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that region.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">However, when the Israelites grew stronger, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor but did not drive them out completely.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The people of Joseph said to Joshua, "Why have you given us only one allotment and one portion for an inheritance? We are a numerous people and the LORD has blessed us abundantly."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"If you are so numerous," Joshua answered, "and if the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you, go up into the forest and clear land for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaites."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The people of Joseph replied, "The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the plain have iron chariots, both those in Beth Shan and its settlements and those in the Valley of Jezreel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But Joshua said to the house of Joseph-to Ephraim and Manasseh-"You are numerous and very powerful. You will have not only one allotment</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">but the forested hill country as well. Clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours; though the Canaanites have iron chariots and though they are strong, you can drive them out."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
<VERS vnumber="1">The whole assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the Tent of Meeting there. The country was brought under their control,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">but there were still seven Israelite tribes who had not yet received their inheritance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So Joshua said to the Israelites: "How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Appoint three men from each tribe. I will send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a description of it, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">You are to divide the land into seven parts. Judah is to remain in its territory on the south and the house of Joseph in its territory on the north.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">After you have written descriptions of the seven parts of the land, bring them here to me and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the LORD our God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The Levites, however, do not get a portion among you, because the priestly service of the LORD is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan. Moses the servant of the LORD gave it to them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">As the men started on their way to map out the land, Joshua instructed them, "Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it. Then return to me, and I will cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So the men left and went through the land. They wrote its description on a scroll, town by town, in seven parts, and returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh in the presence of the LORD, and there he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their tribal divisions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan, passed the northern slope of Jericho and headed west into the hill country, coming out at the desert of Beth Aven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">From there it crossed to the south slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">From the hill facing Beth Horon on the south the boundary turned south along the western side and came out at Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a town of the people of Judah. This was the western side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The southern side began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west, and the boundary came out at the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The boundary went down to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom, north of the Valley of Rephaim. It continued down the Hinnom Valley along the southern slope of the Jebusite city and so to En Rogel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">It then curved north, went to En Shemesh, continued to Geliloth, which faces the Pass of Adummim, and ran down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">It continued to the northern slope of Beth Arabah and on down into the Arabah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">It then went to the northern slope of Beth Hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan in the south. This was the southern boundary.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The Jordan formed the boundary on the eastern side. These were the boundaries that marked out the inheritance of the clans of Benjamin on all sides.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, had the following cities: Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="9">The inheritance of the Simeonites was taken from the share of Judah, because Judah's portion was more than they needed. So the Simeonites received their inheritance within the territory of Judah.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="48">These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Dan, clan by clan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">When they had finished dividing the land into its allotted portions, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">as the LORD had commanded. They gave him the town he asked for-Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim. And he built up the town and settled there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">These are the territories that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel assigned by lot at Shiloh in the presence of the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. And so they finished dividing the land.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then the LORD said to Joshua:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge, as I instructed you through Moses,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="4">"When he flees to one of these cities, he is to stand in the entrance of the city gate and state his case before the elders of that city. Then they are to admit him into their city and give him a place to live with them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">If the avenger of blood pursues him, they must not surrender the one accused, because he killed his neighbor unintentionally and without malice aforethought.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He is to stay in that city until he has stood trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time. Then he may go back to his own home in the town from which he fled."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">On the east side of the Jordan of Jericho they designated Bezer in the desert on the plateau in the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead in the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan in the tribe of Manasseh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Any of the Israelites or any alien living among them who killed someone accidentally could flee to these designated cities and not be killed by the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">Now the family heads of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the other tribal families of Israel</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">at Shiloh in Canaan and said to them, "The LORD commanded through Moses that you give us towns to live in, with pasturelands for our livestock."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So, as the LORD had commanded, the Israelites gave the Levites the following towns and pasturelands out of their own inheritance:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The first lot came out for the Kohathites, clan by clan. The Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest were allotted thirteen towns from the tribes of Judah, Simeon and Benjamin.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="9">From the tribes of Judah and Simeon they allotted the following towns by name</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">(these towns were assigned to the descendants of Aaron who were from the Kohathite clans of the Levites, because the first lot fell to them):</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="12">But the fields and villages around the city they had given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="43">So the LORD gave Israel all the land he had sworn to give their forefathers, and they took possession of it and settled there.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="5">But be very careful to keep the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you: to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to obey his commands, to hold fast to him and to serve him with all your heart and all your soul."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their homes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">(To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan, and to the other half of the tribe Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan with their brothers.) When Joshua sent them home, he blessed them,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="9">So the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan to return to Gilead, their own land, which they had acquired in accordance with the command of the LORD through Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When they came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">And when the Israelites heard that they had built the altar on the border of Canaan at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="23">If we have built our own altar to turn away from the LORD and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, or to sacrifice fellowship offerings on it, may the LORD himself call us to account.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"No! We did it for fear that some day your descendants might say to ours, 'What do you have to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The LORD has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you-you Reubenites and Gadites! You have no share in the LORD.' So your descendants might cause ours to stop fearing the LORD.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="27">On the contrary, it is to be a witness between us and you and the generations that follow, that we will worship the LORD at his sanctuary with our burnt offerings, sacrifices and fellowship offerings. Then in the future your descendants will not be able to say to ours, 'You have no share in the LORD.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">"And we said, 'If they ever say this to us, or to our descendants, we will answer: Look at the replica of the LORD's altar, which our fathers built, not for burnt offerings and sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.'</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="30">When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community-the heads of the clans of the Israelites-heard what Reuben, Gad and Manasseh had to say, they were pleased.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="32">Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, and the leaders returned to Canaan from their meeting with the Reubenites and Gadites in Gilead and reported to the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">They were glad to hear the report and praised God. And they talked no more about going to war against them to devastate the country where the Reubenites and the Gadites lived.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="7">The people served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the LORD had done for Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">After that whole generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation grew up, who knew neither the LORD nor what he had done for Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD and served the Baals.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They provoked the LORD to anger</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">In his anger against Israel the LORD handed them over to raiders who plundered them. He sold them to their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Whenever Israel went out to fight, the hand of the LORD was against them to defeat them, just as he had sworn to them. They were in great distress.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved them out of the hands of these raiders.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. Unlike their fathers, they quickly turned from the way in which their fathers had walked, the way of obedience to the LORD 's commands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for the LORD had compassion on them as they groaned under those who oppressed and afflicted them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their fathers, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and said, "Because this nation has violated the covenant that I laid down for their forefathers and has not listened to me,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the LORD and walk in it as their forefathers did."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The LORD had allowed those nations to remain; he did not drive them out at once by giving them into the hands of Joshua.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">These are the nations the LORD left to test all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars in Canaan</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">(he did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the Israelites who had not had previous battle experience):</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey the LORD 's commands, which he had given their forefathers through Moses.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD; they forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The anger of the LORD burned against Israel so that he sold them into the hands of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram Naharaim, to whom the Israelites were subject for eight years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But when they cried out to the LORD, he raised up for them a deliverer, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, who saved them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, so that he became Israel's judge and went to war. The LORD gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into the hands of Othniel, who overpowered him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So the land had peace for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Once again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and because they did this evil the LORD gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Getting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him, Eglon came and attacked Israel, and they took possession of the City of Palms.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The Israelites were subject to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Again the Israelites cried out to the LORD, and he gave them a deliverer-Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of Gera the Benjamite. The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Now Ehud had made a double-edged sword about a foot and a half long, which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was a very fat man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">After Ehud had presented the tribute, he sent on their way the men who had carried it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">At the idols near Gilgal he himself turned back and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." The king said, "Quiet!" And all his attendants left him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his summer palace and said, "I have a message from God for you." As the king rose from his seat,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king's belly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Even the handle sank in after the blade, which came out his back. Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Then Ehud went out to the porch; he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They said, "He must be relieving himself in the inner room of the house."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">They waited to the point of embarrassment, but when he did not open the doors of the room, they took a key and unlocked them. There they saw their Lord fallen to the floor, dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">While they waited, Ehud got away. He passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">When he arrived there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills, with him leading them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">"Follow me," he ordered, "for the LORD has given Moab, your enemy, into your hands." So they followed him down and, taking possession of the fords of the Jordan that led to Moab, they allowed no one to cross over.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all vigorous and strong; not a man escaped.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">That day Moab was made subject to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He too saved Israel.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">After Ehud died, the Israelites once again did evil in the eyes of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So the LORD sold them into the hands of Jabin, a king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth Haggoyim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Because he had nine hundred iron chariots and had cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years, they cried to the LORD for help.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was leading Israel at that time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">She held court under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites came to her to have their disputes decided.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, "The LORD, the God of Israel, commands you: 'Go, take with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead the way to Mount Tabor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">I will lure Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his troops to the Kishon River and give him into your hands.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Barak said to her, "If you go with me, I will go; but if you don't go with me, I won't go."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Very well," Deborah said, "I will go with you. But because of the way you are going about this, the honor will not be yours, for the LORD will hand Sisera over to a woman." So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">where he summoned Zebulun and Naphtali. Ten thousand men followed him, and Deborah also went with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Now Heber the Kenite had left the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses' brother-in-law, and pitched his tent by the great tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When they told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Sisera gathered together his nine hundred iron chariots and all the men with him, from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then Deborah said to Barak, "Go! This is the day the LORD has given Sisera into your hands. Has not the LORD gone ahead of you?" So Barak went down Mount Tabor, followed by ten thousand men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">At Barak's advance, the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim. All the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Sisera, however, fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there were friendly relations between Jabin king of Hazor and the clan of Heber the Kenite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Come, my Lord, come right in. Don't be afraid." So he entered her tent, and she put a covering over him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"I'm thirsty," he said. "Please give me some water." She opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"Stand in the doorway of the tent," he told her. "If someone comes by and asks you, 'Is anyone here?' say 'No.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">But Jael, Heber's wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted. She drove the peg through his temple into the ground, and he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Barak came by in pursuit of Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him. "Come," she said, "I will show you the man you're looking for." So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera with the tent peg through his temple-dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">On that day God subdued Jabin, the Canaanite king, before the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">And the hand of the Israelites grew stronger and stronger against Jabin, the Canaanite king, until they destroyed him.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"When the princes in Israel take the lead, when the people willingly offer themselves- praise the LORD!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers! I will sing to the LORD, I will sing; I will make music to the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"O LORD, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the land of Edom, the earth shook, the heavens poured, the clouds poured down water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The mountains quaked before the LORD, the One of Sinai, before the LORD, the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the roads were abandoned; travelers took to winding paths.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Village life in Israel ceased, ceased until I, Deborah, arose, arose a mother in Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When they chose new gods, war came to the city gates, and not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">My heart is with Israel's princes, with the willing volunteers among the people. Praise the LORD!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"You who ride on white donkeys, sitting on your saddle blankets, and you who walk along the road, consider</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">the voice of the singers at the watering places. They recite the righteous acts of the LORD, the righteous acts of his warriors in Israel. "Then the people of the LORD went down to the city gates.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">'Wake up, wake up, Deborah! Wake up, wake up, break out in song! Arise, O Barak! Take captive your captives, O son of Abinoam.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"Then the men who were left came down to the nobles; the people of the LORD came to me with the mighty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Some came from Ephraim, whose roots were in Amalek; Benjamin was with the people who followed you. From Makir captains came down, from Zebulun those who bear a commander's staff.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; yes, Issachar was with Barak, rushing after him into the valley. In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Why did you stay among the campfires to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. And Dan, why did he linger by the ships? Asher remained on the coast and stayed in his coves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The people of Zebulun risked their very lives; so did Naphtali on the heights of the field.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Kings came, they fought; the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, but they carried off no silver, no plunder.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">From the heavens the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The river Kishon swept them away, the age-old river, the river Kishon. March on, my soul; be strong!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then thundered the horses' hoofs- galloping, galloping go his mighty steeds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the LORD. 'Curse its people bitterly, because they did not come to help the LORD, to help the LORD against the mighty.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">"Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of tent-dwelling women.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">He asked for water, and she gave him milk; in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Her hand reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman's hammer. She struck Sisera, she crushed his head, she shattered and pierced his temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">At her feet he sank, he fell; there he lay. At her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell-dead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">"Through the window peered Sisera's mother; behind the lattice she cried out, 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">The wisest of her ladies answer her; indeed, she keeps saying to herself,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">'Are they not finding and dividing the spoils: a girl or two for each man, colorful garments as plunder for Sisera, colorful garments embroidered, highly embroidered garments for my neck- all this as plunder?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">"So may all your enemies perish, O LORD! But may they who love you be like the sun when it rises in its strength." Then the land had peace forty years.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the Midianites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count the men and their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the LORD for help.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When the Israelites cried to the LORD because of Midian,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">he sent them a prophet, who said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">I snatched you from the power of Egypt and from the hand of all your oppressors. I drove them from before you and gave you their land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.' But you have not listened to me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The angel of the LORD came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, he said, "The LORD is with you, mighty warrior."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"But sir," Gideon replied, "if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our fathers told us about when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up out of Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and put us into the hand of Midian."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The LORD turned to him and said, "Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"But Lord, "Gideon asked, "how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The LORD answered, "I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites together."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Gideon replied, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you." And the LORD said, "I will wait until you return."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Gideon went in, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth." And Gideon did so.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">With the tip of the staff that was in his hand, the angel of the LORD touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the LORD disappeared.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD, he exclaimed, "Ah, Sovereign LORD! I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">But the LORD said to him, "Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">That same night the LORD said to him, "Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one seven years old. Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then build a proper kind of altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the men of the town, he did it at night rather than in the daytime.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">In the morning when the men of the town got up, there was Baal's altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">They asked each other, "Who did this?" When they carefully investigated, they were told, "Gideon son of Joash did it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">The men of the town demanded of Joash, "Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal's altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, "Are you going to plead Baal's cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">So that day they called Gideon "Jerub-Baal, "saying, "Let Baal contend with him," because he broke down Baal's altar.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Gideon said to God, "If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew-a bowlful of water.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">Then Gideon said to God, "Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece. This time make the fleece dry and the ground covered with dew."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">Early in the morning, Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) and all his men camped at the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The LORD said to Gideon, "You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands. In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own strength has saved her,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">announce now to the people, 'Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.'" So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But the LORD said to Gideon, "There are still too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will sift them for you there. If I say, 'This one shall go with you,' he shall go; but if I say, 'This one shall not go with you,' he shall not go."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the LORD told him, "Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The LORD said to Gideon, "With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands. Let all the other men go, each to his own place."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others. Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">During that night the LORD said to Gideon, "Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp." So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The Midianites, the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. "I had a dream," he was saying. "A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">His friend responded, "This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped God. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, "Get up! The LORD has given the Midianite camp into your hands."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Watch me," he told them. "Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, then from all around the camp blow yours and shout, 'For the LORD and for Gideon.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they shouted, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">While each man held his position around the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">When the three hundred trumpets sounded, the LORD caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Israelites from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah." So all the men of Ephraim were called out and they took the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth Barah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">They also captured two of the Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, "Why have you treated us like this? Why didn't you call us when you went to fight Midian?" And they criticized him sharply.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">But he answered them, "What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren't the gleanings of Ephraim's grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite leaders, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?" At this, their resentment against him subsided.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He said to the men of Succoth, "Give my troops some bread; they are worn out, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But the officials of Succoth said, "Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your troops?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then Gideon replied, "Just for that, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">From there he went up to Peniel and made the same request of them, but they answered as the men of Succoth had.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So he said to the men of Peniel, "When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and fell upon the unsuspecting army.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Zebah and Zalmunna, the two kings of Midian, fled, but he pursued them and captured them, routing their entire army.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He caught a young man of Succoth and questioned him, and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of Succoth, the elders of the town.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Gideon came and said to the men of Succoth, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me by saying, 'Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Succoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the men of the town.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, "What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?Men like you," they answered, "each one with the bearing of a prince."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Gideon replied, "Those were my brothers, the sons of my own mother. As surely as the LORD lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, "Kill them!" But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was only a boy and was afraid.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Come, do it yourself. 'As is the man, so is his strength.'" So Gideon stepped forward and killed them, and took the ornaments off their camels' necks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The Israelites said to Gideon, "Rule over us-you, your son and your grandson-because you have saved us out of the hand of Midian."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">But Gideon told them, "I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The LORD will rule over you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">And he said, "I do have one request, that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder." (It was the custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold earrings.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">They answered, "We'll be glad to give them." So they spread out a garment, and each man threw a ring from his plunder onto it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels, not counting the ornaments, the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the chains that were on their camels' necks.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon's lifetime, the land enjoyed peace forty years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back home to live.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">He had seventy sons of his own, for he had many wives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They set up Baal-Berith as their god and</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">did not remember the LORD their God, who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">They also failed to show kindness to the family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) for all the good things he had done for them.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">Abimelech son of Jerub-Baal went to his mother's brothers in Shechem and said to them and to all his mother's clan,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Ask all the citizens of Shechem, 'Which is better for you: to have all seventy of Jerub-Baal's sons rule over you, or just one man?' Remember, I am your flesh and blood."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When the brothers repeated all this to the citizens of Shechem, they were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, "He is our brother."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">They gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, and Abimelech used it to hire reckless adventurers, who became his followers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He went to his father's home in Ophrah and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerub-Baal. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerub-Baal, escaped by hiding.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then all the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the great tree at the pillar in Shechem to crown Abimelech king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When Jotham was told about this, he climbed up on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them, "Listen to me, citizens of Shechem, so that God may listen to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, 'Be our king.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"But the olive tree answered, 'Should I give up my oil, by which both gods and men are honored, to hold sway over the trees?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Next, the trees said to the fig tree, 'Come and be our king.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"But the fig tree replied, 'Should I give up my fruit, so good and sweet, to hold sway over the trees?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"Then the trees said to the vine, 'Come and be our king.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"But the vine answered, 'Should I give up my wine, which cheers both gods and men, to hold sway over the trees?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, 'Come and be our king.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"The thornbush said to the trees, 'If you really want to anoint me king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, then let fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Now if you have acted honorably and in good faith when you made Abimelech king, and if you have been fair to Jerub-Baal and his family, and if you have treated him as he deserves-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">and to think that my father fought for you, risked his life to rescue you from the hand of Midian</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">(but today you have revolted against my father's family, murdered his seventy sons on a single stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his slave girl, king over the citizens of Shechem because he is your brother)-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">if then you have acted honorably and in good faith toward Jerub-Baal and his family today, may Abimelech be your joy, and may you be his, too!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">But if you have not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume you, citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and let fire come out from you, citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and consume Abimelech!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Jotham fled, escaping to Beer, and he lived there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">After Abimelech had governed Israel three years,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem, who acted treacherously against Abimelech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">God did this in order that the crime against Jerub-Baal's seventy sons, the shedding of their blood, might be avenged on their brother Abimelech and on the citizens of Shechem, who had helped him murder his brothers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">In opposition to him these citizens of Shechem set men on the hilltops to ambush and rob everyone who passed by, and this was reported to Abimelech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Now Gaal son of Ebed moved with his brothers into Shechem, and its citizens put their confidence in him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">After they had gone out into the fields and gathered the grapes and trodden them, they held a festival in the temple of their god. While they were eating and drinking, they cursed Abimelech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then Gaal son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should be subject to him? Isn't he Jerub-Baal's son, and isn't Zebul his deputy? Serve the men of Hamor, Shechem's father! Why should we serve Abimelech?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">If only this people were under my command! Then I would get rid of him. I would say to Abimelech, 'Call out your whole army!'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">When Zebul the governor of the city heard what Gaal son of Ebed said, he was very angry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Under cover he sent messengers to Abimelech, saying, "Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city against you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Now then, during the night you and your men should come and lie in wait in the fields.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">In the morning at sunrise, advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out against you, do whatever your hand finds to do."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">So Abimelech and all his troops set out by night and took up concealed positions near Shechem in four companies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Now Gaal son of Ebed had gone out and was standing at the entrance to the city gate just as Abimelech and his soldiers came out from their hiding place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!" Zebul replied, "You mistake the shadows of the mountains for men."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">But Gaal spoke up again: "Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and a company is coming from the direction of the soothsayers' tree."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Then Zebul said to him, "Where is your big talk now, you who said, 'Who is Abimelech that we should be subject to him?' Aren't these the men you ridiculed? Go out and fight them!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">So Gaal led out the citizens of Shechem and fought Abimelech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Abimelech chased him, and many fell wounded in the flight-all the way to the entrance to the gate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Abimelech stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">The next day the people of Shechem went out to the fields, and this was reported to Abimelech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">So he took his men, divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose to attack them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">Abimelech and the companies with him rushed forward to a position at the entrance to the city gate. Then two companies rushed upon those in the fields and struck them down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">All that day Abimelech pressed his attack against the city until he had captured it and killed its people. Then he destroyed the city and scattered salt over it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">On hearing this, the citizens in the tower of Shechem went into the stronghold of the temple of El-Berith.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">When Abimelech heard that they had assembled there,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">he and all his men went up Mount Zalmon. He took an ax and cut off some branches, which he lifted to his shoulders. He ordered the men with him, "Quick! Do what you have seen me do!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelech. They piled them against the stronghold and set it on fire over the people inside. So all the people in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women, also died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">Next Abimelech went to Thebez and besieged it and captured it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">Inside the city, however, was a strong tower, to which all the men and women-all the people of the city-fled. They locked themselves in and climbed up on the tower roof.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="52">Abimelech went to the tower and stormed it. But as he approached the entrance to the tower to set it on fire,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="53">a woman dropped an upper millstone on his head and cracked his skull.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="54">Hurriedly he called to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and kill me, so that they can't say, 'A woman killed him.'" So his servant ran him through, and he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="55">When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they went home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="56">Thus God repaid the wickedness that Abimelech had done to his father by murdering his seventy brothers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="57">God also made the men of Shechem pay for all their wickedness. The curse of Jotham son of Jerub-Baal came on them.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">After the time of Abimelech a man of Issachar, Tola son of Puah, the son of Dodo, rose to save Israel. He lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He led Israel twenty-three years; then he died, and was buried in Shamir.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He was followed by Jair of Gilead, who led Israel twenty-two years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He had thirty sons, who rode thirty donkeys. They controlled thirty towns in Gilead, which to this day are called Havvoth Jair.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD. They served the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites and the gods of the Philistines. And because the Israelites forsook the LORD and no longer served him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">he became angry with them. He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">who that year shattered and crushed them. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites on the east side of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin and the house of Ephraim; and Israel was in great distress.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD, "We have sinned against you, forsaking our God and serving the Baals."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The LORD replied, "When the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">the Sidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you and you cried to me for help, did I not save you from their hands?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But you have forsaken me and served other gods, so I will no longer save you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them save you when you are in trouble!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But the Israelites said to the LORD, "We have sinned. Do with us whatever you think best, but please rescue us now."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then they got rid of the foreign gods among them and served the LORD. And he could bear Israel's misery no longer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When the Ammonites were called to arms and camped in Gilead, the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The leaders of the people of Gilead said to each other, "Whoever will launch the attack against the Ammonites will be the head of all those living in Gilead."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
<VERS vnumber="1">Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior. His father was Gilead; his mother was a prostitute.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Gilead's wife also bore him sons, and when they were grown up, they drove Jephthah away. "You are not going to get any inheritance in our family," they said, "because you are the son of another woman."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob, where a group of adventurers gathered around him and followed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Some time later, when the Ammonites made war on Israel,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"Come," they said, "be our commander, so we can fight the Ammonites."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Jephthah said to them, "Didn't you hate me and drive me from my father's house? Why do you come to me now, when you're in trouble?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The elders of Gilead said to him, "Nevertheless, we are turning to you now; come with us to fight the Ammonites, and you will be our head over all who live in Gilead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Jephthah answered, "Suppose you take me back to fight the Ammonites and the LORD gives them to me-will I really be your head?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The elders of Gilead replied, "The LORD is our witness; we will certainly do as you say."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them. And he repeated all his words before the LORD in Mizpah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king with the question: "What do you have against us that you have attacked our country?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah's messengers, "When Israel came up out of Egypt, they took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, all the way to the Jordan. Now give it back peaceably."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Jephthah sent back messengers to the Ammonite king,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">saying: "This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But when they came up out of Egypt, Israel went through the desert to the Red Sea and on to Kadesh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Give us permission to go through your country,' but the king of Edom would not listen. They sent also to the king of Moab, and he refused. So Israel stayed at Kadesh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">"Next they traveled through the desert, skirted the lands of Edom and Moab, passed along the eastern side of the country of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon. They did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was its border.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, 'Let us pass through your country to our own place.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Sihon, however, did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. He mustered all his men and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"Then the LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his men into Israel's hands, and they defeated them. Israel took over all the land of the Amorites who lived in that country,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">capturing all of it from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the desert to the Jordan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"Now since the LORD, the God of Israel, has driven the Amorites out before his people Israel, what right have you to take it over?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you? Likewise, whatever the LORD our God has given us, we will possess.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Are you better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel with Israel or fight with them?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">For three hundred years Israel occupied Heshbon, Aroer, the surrounding settlements and all the towns along the Arnon. Why didn't you retake them during that time?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">I have not wronged you, but you are doing me wrong by waging war against me. Let the LORD, the Judge, decide the dispute this day between the Israelites and the Ammonites."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">The king of Ammon, however, paid no attention to the message Jephthah sent him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah. He crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD: "If you give the Ammonites into my hands,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the LORD 's, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the LORD gave them into his hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel Keramim. Thus Israel subdued Ammon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of tambourines! She was an only child. Except for her he had neither son nor daughter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, "Oh! My daughter! You have made me miserable and wretched, because I have made a vow to the LORD that I cannot break."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">"My father," she replied, "you have given your word to the LORD. Do to me just as you promised, now that the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">But grant me this one request," she said. "Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">"You may go," he said. And he let her go for two months. She and the girls went into the hills and wept because she would never marry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">After the two months, she returned to her father and he did to her as he had vowed. And she was a virgin. From this comes the Israelite custom</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
<VERS vnumber="1">The men of Ephraim called out their forces, crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, "Why did you go to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We're going to burn down your house over your head."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Jephthah answered, "I and my people were engaged in a great struggle with the Ammonites, and although I called, you didn't save me out of their hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When I saw that you wouldn't help, I took my life in my hands and crossed over to fight the Ammonites, and the LORD gave me the victory over them. Now why have you come up today to fight me?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Jephthah then called together the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. The Gileadites struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, "You Gileadites are renegades from Ephraim and Manasseh."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a survivor of Ephraim said, "Let me cross over," the men of Gilead asked him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If he replied, "No,"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">they said, "All right, say 'Shibboleth.'" If he said, "Sibboleth," because he could not pronounce the word correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Jephthah led Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and was buried in a town in Gilead.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem led Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He gave his daughters away in marriage to those outside his clan, and for his sons he brought in thirty young women as wives from outside his clan. Ibzan led Israel seven years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then Ibzan died, and was buried in Bethlehem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">After him, Elon the Zebulunite led Israel ten years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then Elon died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">After him, Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, led Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. He led Israel eight years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Abdon son of Hillel died, and was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
<VERS vnumber="1">Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, so the LORD delivered them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">A certain man of Zorah, named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, had a wife who was sterile and remained childless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The angel of the LORD appeared to her and said, "You are sterile and childless, but you are going to conceive and have a son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">because you will conceive and give birth to a son. No razor may be used on his head, because the boy is to be a Nazirite, set apart to God from birth, and he will begin the deliverance of Israel from the hands of the Philistines."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then the woman went to her husband and told him, "A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God, very awesome. I didn't ask him where he came from, and he didn't tell me his name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But he said to me, 'You will conceive and give birth to a son. Now then, drink no wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth until the day of his death.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then Manoah prayed to the LORD: "O LORD, I beg you, let the man of God you sent to us come again to teach us how to bring up the boy who is to be born."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">God heard Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The woman hurried to tell her husband, "He's here! The man who appeared to me the other day!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he said, "Are you the one who talked to my wife?I am," he said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">So Manoah asked him, "When your words are fulfilled, what is to be the rule for the boy's life and work?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The angel of the LORD answered, "Your wife must do all that I have told her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "We would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The angel of the LORD replied, "Even though you detain me, I will not eat any of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD." (Manoah did not realize that it was the angel of the LORD.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Manoah inquired of the angel of the LORD, "What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes true?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He replied, "Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding. "</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then Manoah took a young goat, together with the grain offering, and sacrificed it on a rock to the LORD. And the LORD did an amazing thing while Manoah and his wife watched:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">As the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven, the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame. Seeing this, Manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When the angel of the LORD did not show himself again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized that it was the angel of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"We are doomed to die!" he said to his wife. "We have seen God!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">But his wife answered, "If the LORD had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things or now told us this."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The woman gave birth to a boy and named him Samson. He grew and the LORD blessed him,</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="7">Then he went down and talked with the woman, and he liked her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Some time later, when he went back to marry her, he turned aside to look at the lion's carcass. In it was a swarm of bees and some honey,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">which he scooped out with his hands and ate as he went along. When he rejoined his parents, he gave them some, and they too ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion's carcass.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Now his father went down to see the woman. And Samson made a feast there, as was customary for bridegrooms.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When he appeared, he was given thirty companions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"Let me tell you a riddle," Samson said to them. "If you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">If you can't tell me the answer, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.Tell us your riddle," they said. "Let's hear it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He replied, "Out of the eater, something to eat; out of the strong, something sweet." For three days they could not give the answer.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">On the fourth day, they said to Samson's wife, "Coax your husband into explaining the riddle for us, or we will burn you and your father's household to death. Did you invite us here to rob us?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then Samson's wife threw herself on him, sobbing, "You hate me! You don't really love me. You've given my people a riddle, but you haven't told me the answer.I haven't even explained it to my father or mother," he replied, "so why should I explain it to you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">She cried the whole seven days of the feast. So on the seventh day he finally told her, because she continued to press him. She in turn explained the riddle to her people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Before sunset on the seventh day the men of the town said to him, "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" Samson said to them, "If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him in power. He went down to Ashkelon, struck down thirty of their men, stripped them of their belongings and gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle. Burning with anger, he went up to his father's house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And Samson's wife was given to the friend who had attended him at his wedding.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
<VERS vnumber="1">Later on, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. He said, "I'm going to my wife's room." But her father would not let him go in.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"I was so sure you thoroughly hated her," he said, "that I gave her to your friend. Isn't her younger sister more attractive? Take her instead."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Samson said to them, "This time I have a right to get even with the Philistines; I will really harm them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs. He then fastened a torch to every pair of tails,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">lit the torches and let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned up the shocks and standing grain, together with the vineyards and olive groves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When the Philistines asked, "Who did this?" they were told, "Samson, the Timnite's son-in-law, because his wife was given to his friend." So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Samson said to them, "Since you've acted like this, I won't stop until I get my revenge on you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He attacked them viciously and slaughtered many of them. Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The Philistines went up and camped in Judah, spreading out near Lehi.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The men of Judah asked, "Why have you come to fight us?We have come to take Samson prisoner," they answered, "to do to him as he did to us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson, "Don't you realize that the Philistines are rulers over us? What have you done to us?" He answered, "I merely did to them what they did to me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They said to him, "We've come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines." Samson said, "Swear to me that you won't kill me yourselves."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"Agreed," they answered. "We will only tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you." So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came toward him shouting. The Spirit of the LORD came upon him in power. The ropes on his arms became like charred flax, and the bindings dropped from his hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then Samson said, "With a donkey's jawbone I have made donkeys of them. With a donkey's jawbone I have killed a thousand men."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was called Ramath Lehi.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Because he was very thirsty, he cried out to the LORD, "You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he revived. So the spring was called En Hakkore, and it is still there in Lehi.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Samson led Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
<VERS vnumber="1">One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute. He went in to spend the night with her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The people of Gaza were told, "Samson is here!" So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They made no move during the night, saying, "At dawn we'll kill him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night. Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate, together with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Some time later, he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, "See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So Delilah said to Samson, "Tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Samson answered her, "If anyone ties me with seven fresh thongs that have not been dried, I'll become as weak as any other man."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh thongs that had not been dried, and she tied him with them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">With men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" But he snapped the thongs as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then Delilah said to Samson, "You have made a fool of me; you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be tied."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He said, "If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used, I'll become as weak as any other man."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Delilah then said to Samson, "Until now, you have been making a fool of me and lying to me. Tell me how you can be tied." He replied, "If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom and tighten it with the pin, I'll become as weak as any other man." So while he was sleeping, Delilah took the seven braids of his head, wove them into the fabric</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">and tightened it with the pin. Again she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" He awoke from his sleep and pulled up the pin and the loom, with the fabric.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then she said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when you won't confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven't told me the secret of your great strength."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">With such nagging she prodded him day after day until he was tired to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So he told her everything. "No razor has ever been used on my head," he said, "because I have been a Nazirite set apart to God since birth. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines, "Come back once more; he has told me everything." So the rulers of the Philistines returned with the silver in their hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Having put him to sleep on her lap, she called a man to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and so began to subdue him. And his strength left him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then she called, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" He awoke from his sleep and thought, "I'll go out as before and shake myself free." But he did not know that the LORD had left him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding in the prison.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, "Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, "Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, the one who laid waste our land and multiplied our slain."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">While they were in high spirits, they shouted, "Bring out Samson to entertain us." So they called Samson out of the prison, and he performed for them. When they stood him among the pillars,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Samson said to the servant who held his hand, "Put me where I can feel the pillars that support the temple, so that I may lean against them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Now the temple was crowded with men and women; all the rulers of the Philistines were there, and on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then Samson prayed to the LORD, "O Sovereign LORD, remember me. O God, please strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">Then his brothers and his father's whole family went down to get him. They brought him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led Israel twenty years.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">said to his mother, "The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse-I have that silver with me; I took it." Then his mother said, "The LORD bless you, my son!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, "I solemnly consecrate my silver to the LORD for my son to make a carved image and a cast idol. I will give it back to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So he returned the silver to his mother, and she took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into the image and the idol. And they were put in Micah's house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some idols and installed one of his sons as his priest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Micah asked him, "Where are you from?I'm a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah," he said, "and I'm looking for a place to stay."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then Micah said to him, "Live with me and be my father and priest, and I'll give you ten shekels of silver a year, your clothes and your food."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man was to him like one of his sons.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">And Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
<VERS vnumber="1">In those days Israel had no king. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle, because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So the Danites sent five warriors from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it. These men represented all their clans. They told them, "Go, explore the land." The men entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When they were near Micah's house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they turned in there and asked him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">He told them what Micah had done for him, and said, "He has hired me and I am his priest."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then they said to him, "Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The priest answered them, "Go in peace. Your journey has the LORD 's approval."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So the five men left and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living in safety, like the Sidonians, unsuspecting and secure. And since their land lacked nothing, they were prosperous. Also, they lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no relationship with anyone else.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers asked them, "How did you find things?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">They answered, "Come on, let's attack them! We have seen that the land is very good. Aren't you going to do something? Don't hesitate to go there and take it over.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When you get there, you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that God has put into your hands, a land that lacks nothing whatever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then six hundred men from the clan of the Danites, armed for battle, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">On their way they set up camp near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan to this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah's house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish said to their brothers, "Do you know that one of these houses has an ephod, other household gods, a carved image and a cast idol? Now you know what to do."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So they turned in there and went to the house of the young Levite at Micah's place and greeted him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The six hundred Danites, armed for battle, stood at the entrance to the gate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance to the gate.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When these men went into Micah's house and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">They answered him, "Be quiet! Don't say a word. Come with us, and be our father and priest. Isn't it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man's household?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then the priest was glad. He took the ephod, the other household gods and the carved image and went along with the people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Putting their little children, their livestock and their possessions in front of them, they turned away and left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">When they had gone some distance from Micah's house, the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">As they shouted after them, the Danites turned and said to Micah, "What's the matter with you that you called out your men to fight?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">He replied, "You took the gods I made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you ask, 'What's the matter with you?'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The Danites answered, "Don't argue with us, or some hot-tempered men will attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">So the Danites went their way, and Micah, seeing that they were too strong for him, turned around and went back home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish, against a peaceful and unsuspecting people. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">They named it Dan after their forefather Dan, who was born to Israel-though the city used to be called Laish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">There the Danites set up for themselves the idols, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">They continued to use the idols Micah had made, all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
<VERS vnumber="1">In those days Israel had no king. Now a Levite who lived in a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">But she was unfaithful to him. She left him and went back to her father's house in Bethlehem, Judah. After she had been there four months,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">her husband went to her to persuade her to return. He had with him his servant and two donkeys. She took him into her father's house, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">His father-in-law, the girl's father, prevailed upon him to stay; so he remained with him three days, eating and drinking, and sleeping there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave, but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Refresh yourself with something to eat; then you can go."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. Afterward the girl's father said, "Please stay tonight and enjoy yourself."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And when the man got up to go, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">On the morning of the fifth day, when he rose to go, the girl's father said, "Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!" So the two of them ate together.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then when the man, with his concubine and his servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said, "Now look, it's almost evening. Spend the night here; the day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But, unwilling to stay another night, the man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, "Come, let's stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">His master replied, "No. We won't go into an alien city, whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He added, "Come, let's try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So they went on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them into his home for the night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was living in Gibeah (the men of the place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the fields.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When he looked and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, "Where are you going? Where did you come from?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">He answered, "We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the LORD. No one has taken me into his house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants-me, your maidservant, and the young man with us. We don't need anything."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"You are welcome at my house," the old man said. "Let me supply whatever you need. Only don't spend the night in the square."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, "Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The owner of the house went outside and said to them, "No, my friends, don't be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don't do this disgraceful thing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But to this man, don't do such a disgraceful thing."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">He said to her, "Get up; let's go." But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Everyone who saw it said, "Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Think about it! Consider it! Tell us what to do!"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then all the Israelites from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came out as one man and assembled before the LORD in Mizpah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The leaders of all the people of the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand soldiers armed with swords.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">(The Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the Israelites said, "Tell us how this awful thing happened."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, said, "I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">During the night the men of Gibeah came after me and surrounded the house, intending to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">I took my concubine, cut her into pieces and sent one piece to each region of Israel's inheritance, because they committed this lewd and disgraceful act in Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now, all you Israelites, speak up and give your verdict."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">All the people rose as one man, saying, "None of us will go home. No, not one of us will return to his house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But now this is what we'll do to Gibeah: We'll go up against it as the lot directs.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">We'll take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred from a thousand, and a thousand from ten thousand, to get provisions for the army. Then, when the army arrives at Gibeah in Benjamin, it can give them what they deserve for all this vileness done in Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So all the men of Israel got together and united as one man against the city.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What about this awful crime that was committed among you?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Now surrender those wicked men of Gibeah so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel." But the Benjamites would not listen to their fellow Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">From their towns they came together at Gibeah to fight against the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">At once the Benjamites mobilized twenty-six thousand swordsmen from their towns, in addition to seven hundred chosen men from those living in Gibeah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred chosen men who were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen, all of them fighting men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The Israelites went up to Bethel and inquired of God. They said, "Who of us shall go first to fight against the Benjamites?" The LORD replied, "Judah shall go first."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The next morning the Israelites got up and pitched camp near Gibeah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">The men of Israel went out to fight the Benjamites and took up battle positions against them at Gibeah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down twenty-two thousand Israelites on the battlefield that day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But the men of Israel encouraged one another and again took up their positions where they had stationed themselves the first day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The Israelites went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and they inquired of the LORD. They said, "Shall we go up again to battle against the Benjamites, our brothers?" The LORD answered, "Go up against them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then the Israelites drew near to Benjamin the second day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">This time, when the Benjamites came out from Gibeah to oppose them, they cut down another eighteen thousand Israelites, all of them armed with swords.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Then the Israelites, all the people, went up to Bethel, and there they sat weeping before the LORD. They fasted that day until evening and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">And the Israelites inquired of the LORD. (In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, ministering before it.) They asked, "Shall we go up again to battle with Benjamin our brother, or not?" The LORD responded, "Go, for tomorrow I will give them into your hands."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Then Israel set an ambush around Gibeah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">They went up against the Benjamites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before, so that about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads-the one leading to Bethel and the other to Gibeah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">While the Benjamites were saying, "We are defeating them as before," the Israelites were saying, "Let's retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">All the men of Israel moved from their places and took up positions at Baal Tamar, and the Israelite ambush charged out of its place on the west of Gibeah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Then ten thousand of Israel's finest men made a frontal attack on Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten. Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">The men who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah, spread out and put the whole city to the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">The men of Israel had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">and then the men of Israel would turn in the battle. The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the men of Israel (about thirty), and they said, "We are defeating them as in the first battle."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the smoke of the whole city going up into the sky.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Then the men of Israel turned on them, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, because they realized that disaster had come upon them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the desert, but they could not escape the battle. And the men of Israel who came out of the towns cut them down there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">As they turned and fled toward the desert to the rock of Rimmon, the Israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads. They kept pressing after the Benjamites as far as Gidom and struck down two thousand more.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">On that day twenty-five thousand Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them valiant fighters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">But six hundred men turned and fled into the desert to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found. All the towns they came across they set on fire.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
<VERS vnumber="1">The men of Israel had taken an oath at Mizpah: "Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The people went to Bethel, where they sat before God until evening, raising their voices and weeping bitterly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"O LORD, the God of Israel," they cried, "why has this happened to Israel? Why should one tribe be missing from Israel today?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then the Israelites asked, "Who from all the tribes of Israel has failed to assemble before the LORD?" For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to assemble before the LORD at Mizpah should certainly be put to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Now the Israelites grieved for their brothers, the Benjamites. "Today one tribe is cut off from Israel," they said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"How can we provide wives for those who are left, since we have taken an oath by the LORD not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then they asked, "Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble before the LORD at Mizpah?" They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">For when they counted the people, they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"This is what you are to do," they said. "Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The people grieved for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">And the elders of the assembly said, "With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The Benjamite survivors must have heirs," they said, "so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">We can't give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: 'Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">But look, there is the annual festival of the LORD in Shiloh, to the north of Bethel, and east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and to the south of Lebonah."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, "Go and hide in the vineyards</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">and watch. When the girls of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, then rush from the vineyards and each of you seize a wife from the girls of Shiloh and go to the land of Benjamin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, 'Do us a kindness by helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war, and you are innocent, since you did not give your daughters to them.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So that is what the Benjamites did. While the girls were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When she heard in Moab that the LORD had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, Naomi and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the LORD show kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead and to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband." Then she kissed them and they wept aloud</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">and said to her, "We will go back with you to your people."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But Naomi said, "Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me-even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has gone out against me!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"Look," said Naomi, "your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But Ruth replied, "Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, "Can this be Naomi?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"Don't call me Naomi, "she told them. "Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The LORD has afflicted me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side, from the clan of Elimelech, a man of standing, whose name was Boaz.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, "Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor." Naomi said to her, "Go ahead, my daughter."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">So she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, "The LORD be with you!The LORD bless you!" they called back.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, "Whose young woman is that?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The foreman replied, "She is the Moabitess who came back from Moab with Naomi.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">She said, 'Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.' She went into the field and has worked steadily from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So Boaz said to Ruth, "My daughter, listen to me. Don't go and glean in another field and don't go away from here. Stay here with my servant girls.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the girls. I have told the men not to touch you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She exclaimed, "Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me-a foreigner?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Boaz replied, "I've been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband-how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">May the LORD repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord," she said. "You have given me comfort and have spoken kindly to your servant-though I do not have the standing of one of your servant girls."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar." When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, "Even if she gathers among the sheaves, don't embarrass her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Rather, pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don't rebuke her."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Her mother-in-law asked her, "Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!" Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. "The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz," she said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"The LORD bless him!" Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. "He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead." She added, "That man is our close relative; he is one of our kinsman-redeemers."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Ruth the Moabitess said, "He even said to me, 'Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with his girls, because in someone else's field you might be harmed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">One day Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, should I not try to find a home for you, where you will be well provided for?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Is not Boaz, with whose servant girls you have been, a kinsman of ours? Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Wash and perfume yourself, and put on your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but don't let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When he lies down, note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"I will do whatever you say," Ruth answered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">In the middle of the night something startled the man, and he turned and discovered a woman lying at his feet.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Who are you?" he asked. "I am your servant Ruth," she said. "Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a kinsman-redeemer."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"The LORD bless you, my daughter," he replied. "This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier: You have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">And now, my daughter, don't be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All my fellow townsmen know that you are a woman of noble character.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Although it is true that I am near of kin, there is a kinsman-redeemer nearer than I.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to redeem, good; let him redeem. But if he is not willing, as surely as the LORD lives I will do it. Lie here until morning."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, "Don't let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He also said, "Bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out." When she did so, he poured into it six measures of barley and put it on her. Then he went back to town.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, "How did it go, my daughter?" Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">and added, "He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, 'Don't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then Naomi said, "Wait, my daughter, until you find out what happens. For the man will not rest until the matter is settled today."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">Meanwhile Boaz went up to the town gate and sat there. When the kinsman-redeemer he had mentioned came along, Boaz said, "Come over here, my friend, and sit down." So he went over and sat down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Boaz took ten of the elders of the town and said, "Sit here," and they did so.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Then he said to the kinsman-redeemer, "Naomi, who has come back from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you will not, tell me, so I will know. For no one has the right to do it except you, and I am next in line.I will redeem it," he said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy the land from Naomi and from Ruth the Moabitess, you acquire the dead man's widow, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">At this, the kinsman-redeemer said, "Then I cannot redeem it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">(Now in earlier times in Israel, for the redemption and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So the kinsman-redeemer said to Boaz, "Buy it yourself." And he removed his sandal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then Boaz announced to the elders and all the people, "Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelech, Kilion and Mahlon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon's widow, as my wife, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from the town records. Today you are witnesses!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then the elders and all those at the gate said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you have standing in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Through the offspring the LORD gives you by this young woman, may your family be like that of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. Then he went to her, and the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The women said to Naomi: "Praise be to the LORD, who this day has not left you without a kinsman-redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Then Naomi took the child, laid him in her lap and cared for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The women living there said, "Naomi has a son." And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">This, then, is the family line of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Hezron the father of Ram, Ram the father of Amminadab,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Salmon the father of Boaz, Boaz the father of Obed,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of David.</VERS>

<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="9" bname="1 Samuel" bsname="1Sam">
<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
<VERS vnumber="1">There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">And because the LORD had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Elkanah her husband would say to her, "Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD's temple.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">And she made a vow, saying, "O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">As she kept on praying to the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">and said to her, "How long will you keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">"Not so, my lord," Hannah replied, "I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Eli answered, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">She said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes." Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So in the course of time Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, "Because I asked the LORD for him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, "After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the LORD, and he will live there always."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">"Do what seems best to you," Elkanah her husband told her. "Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good his word." So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">When they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">and she said to him, "As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">So now I give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Hannah prayed and said: "My heart rejoices in the LORD; in the LORD my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"There is no one holy like the LORD; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the LORD is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry hunger no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">"The LORD brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave and raises up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">The LORD sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. "For the foundations of the earth are the LORD's; upon them he has set the world.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He will guard the feet of his saints, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. "It is not by strength that one prevails;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">those who oppose the LORD will be shattered. He will thunder against them from heaven; the LORD will judge the ends of the earth. "He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the LORD under Eli the priest.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Eli's sons were wicked men; they had no regard for the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Now it was the practice of the priests with the people that whenever anyone offered a sacrifice and while the meat was being boiled, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He would plunge it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot, and the priest would take for himself whatever the fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">If the man said to him, "Let the fat be burned up first, and then take whatever you want," the servant would then answer, "No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">This sin of the young men was very great in the LORD's sight, for they were treating the LORD's offering with contempt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But Samuel was ministering before the LORD -a boy wearing a linen ephod.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, "May the LORD give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the LORD." Then they would go home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">And the LORD was gracious to Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So he said to them, "Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD's people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">If a man sins against another man, God may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">I chose your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your father's house all the offerings made with fire by the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, in your family line there will never be an old man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Every one of you that I do not cut off from my altar will be spared only to blind your eyes with tears and to grieve your heart, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">"'And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you-they will both die on the same day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his house, and he will minister before my anointed one always.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a crust of bread and plead, "Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat."'"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
<VERS vnumber="1">The boy Samuel ministered before the LORD under Eli. In those days the word of the LORD was rare; there were not many visions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Then the LORD called Samuel. Samuel answered, "Here I am."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">And he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." But Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down." So he went and lay down.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Again the LORD called, "Samuel!" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me.My son," Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD: The word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The LORD called Samuel a third time, and Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." Then Eli realized that the LORD was calling the boy.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So Eli told Samuel, "Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, 'Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The LORD came and stood there, calling as at the other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" Then Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant is listening."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">And the LORD said to Samuel: "See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family-from beginning to end.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons made themselves contemptible, and he failed to restrain them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Therefore, I swore to the house of Eli, 'The guilt of Eli's house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the LORD. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">but Eli called him and said, "Samuel, my son." Samuel answered, "Here I am."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"What was it he said to you?" Eli asked. "Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, "He is the LORD; let him do what is good in his eyes."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The LORD was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of his words fall to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The LORD continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
<VERS vnumber="1">And Samuel's word came to all Israel. Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why did the LORD bring defeat upon us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the LORD's covenant from Shiloh, so that it may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the LORD Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When the ark of the LORD's covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, "What's all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?" When they learned that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">the Philistines were afraid. "A god has come into the camp," they said. "We're in trouble! Nothing like this has happened before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh, his clothes torn and dust on his head.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town sent up a cry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Eli heard the outcry and asked, "What is the meaning of this uproar?" The man hurried over to Eli,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes were set so that he could not see.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He told Eli, "I have just come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day." Eli asked, "What happened, my son?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The man who brought the news replied, "Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man and heavy. He had led Israel forty years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">As she was dying, the women attending her said, "Don't despair; you have given birth to a son." But she did not respond or pay any attention.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">She named the boy Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel"-because of the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">She said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
<VERS vnumber="1">After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Then they carried the ark into Dagon's temple and set it beside Dagon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the LORD! They took Dagon and put him back in his place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the LORD! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon's temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The LORD's hand was heavy upon the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation upon them and afflicted them with tumors.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When the men of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, "The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, "What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?" They answered, "Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath." So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But after they had moved it, the LORD's hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, "They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, "Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it will kill us and our people." For death had filled the city with panic; God's hand was very heavy upon it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
<VERS vnumber="1">When the ark of the LORD had been in Philistine territory seven months,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we should send it back to its place."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">They answered, "If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it away empty, but by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The Philistines asked, "What guilt offering should we send to him?" They replied, "Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and pay honor to Israel's god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When he treated them harshly, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Take the ark of the LORD and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then the LORD has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us and that it happened to us by chance."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">They placed the ark of the LORD on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">The Levites took down the ark of the LORD, together with the chest containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the LORD -one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers-the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock, on which they set the ark of the LORD, is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">But God struck down some of the men of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy of them to death because they had looked into the ark of the LORD. The people mourned because of the heavy blow the LORD had dealt them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">and the men of Beth Shemesh asked, "Who can stand in the presence of the LORD, this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to your place."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
<VERS vnumber="1">So the men of Kiriath Jearim came and took up the ark of the LORD. They took it to Abinadab's house on the hill and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">It was a long time, twenty years in all, that the ark remained at Kiriath Jearim, and all the people of Israel mourned and sought after the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">And Samuel said to the whole house of Israel, "If you are returning to the LORD with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to the LORD and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served the LORD only.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then Samuel said, "Assemble all Israel at Mizpah and I will intercede with the LORD for you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the LORD. On that day they fasted and there they confessed, "We have sinned against the LORD." And Samuel was leader of Israel at Mizpah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. And when the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">They said to Samuel, "Do not stop crying out to the LORD our God for us, that he may rescue us from the hand of the Philistines."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it up as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. He cried out to the LORD on Israel's behalf, and the LORD answered him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day the LORD thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Car.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, "Thus far has the LORD helped us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So the Philistines were subdued and did not invade Israelite territory again. Throughout Samuel's lifetime, the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to her, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the power of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Samuel continued as judge over Israel all the days of his life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">From year to year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">But he always went back to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also judged Israel. And he built an altar there to the LORD.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
<VERS vnumber="1">When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges for Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah, and they served at Beersheba.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But his sons did not walk in his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">They said to him, "You are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But when they said, "Give us a king to lead us," this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">And the LORD told him: "Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will do."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He said, "This is what the king who will reign over you will do: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Your menservants and maidservants and the best of your cattle and donkeys he will take for his own use.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, and the LORD will not answer you in that day."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">But the people refused to listen to Samuel. "No!" they said. "We want a king over us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated it before the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">The LORD answered, "Listen to them and give them a king." Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, "Everyone go back to his town."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
<VERS vnumber="1">There was a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">He had a son named Saul, an impressive young man without equal among the Israelites-a head taller than any of the others.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now the donkeys belonging to Saul's father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, "Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, "Come, let's go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">But the servant replied, "Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let's go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Saul said to his servant, "If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The servant answered him again. "Look," he said, "I have a quarter of a shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">(Formerly in Israel, if a man went to inquire of God, he would say, "Come, let us go to the seer," because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">"Good," Saul said to his servant. "Come, let's go." So they set out for the town where the man of God was.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some girls coming out to draw water, and they asked them, "Is the seer here?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"He is," they answered. "He's ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Now the day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed this to Samuel:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him leader over my people Israel; he will deliver my people from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked upon my people, for their cry has reached me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the LORD said to him, "This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, "Would you please tell me where the seer's house is?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">"I am the seer," Samuel replied. "Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and all your father's family?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Saul answered, "But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited-about thirty in number.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">So the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, "Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion, from the time I said, 'I have invited guests.'" And Saul dined with Samuel that day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">They rose about daybreak and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get ready, and I will send you on your way." When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead of us"-and the servant did so-"but you stay here awhile, so that I may give you a message from God."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on Saul's head and kissed him, saying, "Has not the LORD anointed you leader over his inheritance?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, 'The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking, "What shall I do about my son?"'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">"Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">"After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, tambourines, flutes and harps being played before them, and they will be prophesying.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">The Spirit of the LORD will come upon you in power, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Once these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul's heart, and all these signs were fulfilled that day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When they arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came upon him in power, and he joined in their prophesying.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, "What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">A man who lived there answered, "And who is their father?" So it became a saying: "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Now Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, "Where have you been?Looking for the donkeys," he said. "But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Saul's uncle said, "Tell me what Samuel said to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Saul replied, "He assured us that the donkeys had been found." But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Samuel summoned the people of Israel to the LORD at Mizpah</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">and said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your calamities and distresses. And you have said, 'No, set a king over us.' So now present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and clans."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">When Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri's clan was chosen. Finally Saul son of Kish was chosen. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So they inquired further of the LORD, "Has the man come here yet?" And the LORD said, "Yes, he has hidden himself among the baggage."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see the man the LORD has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people." Then the people shouted, "Long live the king!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Samuel explained to the people the regulations of the kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the LORD. Then Samuel dismissed the people, each to his own home.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God had touched.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">But some troublemakers said, "How can this fellow save us?" They despised him and brought him no gifts. But Saul kept silent.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
<VERS vnumber="1">Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh Gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to him, "Make a treaty with us, and we will be subject to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">But Nahash the Ammonite replied, "I will make a treaty with you only on the condition that I gouge out the right eye of every one of you and so bring disgrace on all Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The elders of Jabesh said to him, "Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout Israel; if no one comes to rescue us, we will surrender to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and reported these terms to the people, they all wept aloud.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Just then Saul was returning from the fields, behind his oxen, and he asked, "What is wrong with the people? Why are they weeping?" Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God came upon him in power, and he burned with anger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel, proclaiming, "This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel." Then the terror of the LORD fell on the people, and they turned out as one man.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">When Saul mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">They told the messengers who had come, "Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead, 'By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be delivered.'" When the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh, they were elated.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">They said to the Ammonites, "Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever seems good to you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions; during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The people then said to Samuel, "Who was it that asked, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring these men to us and we will put them to death."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But Saul said, "No one shall be put to death today, for this day the LORD has rescued Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, let us go to Gilgal and there reaffirm the kingship."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">So all the people went to Gilgal and confirmed Saul as king in the presence of the LORD. There they sacrificed fellowship offerings before the LORD, and Saul and all the Israelites held a great celebration.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
<VERS vnumber="1">Samuel said to all Israel, "I have listened to everything you said to me and have set a king over you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Now you have a king as your leader. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Here I stand. Testify against me in the presence of the LORD and his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe to make me shut my eyes? If I have done any of these, I will make it right."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">"You have not cheated or oppressed us," they replied. "You have not taken anything from anyone's hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Samuel said to them, "The LORD is witness against you, and also his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.He is witness," they said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then Samuel said to the people, "It is the LORD who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your forefathers up out of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now then, stand here, because I am going to confront you with evidence before the LORD as to all the righteous acts performed by the LORD for you and your fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"After Jacob entered Egypt, they cried to the LORD for help, and the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your forefathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"But they forgot the LORD their God; so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">They cried out to the LORD and said, 'We have sinned; we have forsaken the LORD and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve you.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then the LORD sent Jerub-Baal, Barak, Jephthah and Samuel, and he delivered you from the hands of your enemies on every side, so that you lived securely.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">"But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, 'No, we want a king to rule over us'-even though the LORD your God was your king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you asked for; see, the LORD has set a king over you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">If you fear the LORD and serve and obey him and do not rebel against his commands, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the LORD your God-good!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">But if you do not obey the LORD, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your fathers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Now then, stand still and see this great thing the LORD is about to do before your eyes!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call upon the LORD to send thunder and rain. And you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of the LORD when you asked for a king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then Samuel called upon the LORD, and that same day the LORD sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of the LORD and of Samuel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The people all said to Samuel, "Pray to the LORD your God for your servants so that we will not die, for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"Do not be afraid," Samuel replied. "You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">For the sake of his great name the LORD will not reject his people, because the LORD was pleased to make you his own.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">But be sure to fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will be swept away."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
<VERS vnumber="1">Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty- two years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Micmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, "Let the Hebrews hear!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So all Israel heard the news: "Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines." And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When the men of Israel saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul's men began to scatter.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">So he said, "Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings. "And Saul offered up the burnt offering.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"What have you done?" asked Samuel. Saul replied, "When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Micmash,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">I thought, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the LORD's favor.' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">"You acted foolishly," Samuel said. "You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you have not kept the LORD's command."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Micmash.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the desert.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, "Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plowshares, mattocks, axes and sickles sharpened.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The price was two thirds of a shekel for sharpening plowshares and mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Micmash.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
<VERS vnumber="1">One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man bearing his armor, "Come, let's go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side." But he did not tell his father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez, and the other Seneh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">One cliff stood to the north toward Micmash, the other to the south toward Geba.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, "Come, let's go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised fellows. Perhaps the LORD will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"Do all that you have in mind," his armor-bearer said. "Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Jonathan said, "Come, then; we will cross over toward the men and let them see us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">If they say to us, 'Wait there until we come to you,' we will stay where we are and not go up to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">But if they say, 'Come up to us,' we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the LORD has given them into our hands."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. "Look!" said the Philistines. "The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, "Come up to us and we'll teach you a lesson." So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Climb up after me; the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then panic struck the whole army-those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties-and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Saul's lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then Saul said to the men who were with him, "Muster the forces and see who has left us." When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God." (At that time it was with the Israelites.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So the LORD rescued Israel that day, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Now the men of Israel were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, "Cursed be any man who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!" So none of the troops tasted food.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out, yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then one of the soldiers told him, "Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, 'Cursed be any man who eats food today!' That is why the men are faint."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Jonathan said, "My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Then someone said to Saul, "Look, the men are sinning against the LORD by eating meat that has blood in it.You have broken faith," he said. "Roll a large stone over here at once."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Then he said, "Go out among the men and tell them, 'Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with blood still in it.'" So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first time he had done this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive.Do whatever seems best to you," they replied. But the priest said, "Let us inquire of God here."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">So Saul asked God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel's hand?" But God did not answer him that day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Saul therefore said, "Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">As surely as the LORD who rescues Israel lives, even if it lies with my son Jonathan, he must die." But not one of the men said a word.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Saul then said to all the Israelites, "You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here.Do what seems best to you," the men replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Then Saul prayed to the LORD, the God of Israel, "Give me the right answer." And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son." And Jonathan was taken.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." So Jonathan told him, "I merely tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now must I die?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">Saul said, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">But the men said to Saul, "Should Jonathan die-he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God's help." So the men rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">His wife's name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of Saul's army was Abner son of Ner, and Ner was Saul's uncle.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">Saul's father Kish and Abner's father Ner were sons of Abiel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="52">All the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
<VERS vnumber="1">Samuel said to Saul, "I am the one the LORD sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim-two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men from Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Then he said to the Kenites, "Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt." So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, to the east of Egypt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs-everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel:</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions." Samuel was troubled, and he cried out to the LORD all that night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, "Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">When Samuel reached him, Saul said, "The LORD bless you! I have carried out the LORD's instructions."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">But Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Saul answered, "The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God, but we totally destroyed the rest."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">"Stop!" Samuel said to Saul. "Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night.Tell me," Saul replied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Samuel said, "Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And he sent you on a mission, saying, 'Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; make war on them until you have wiped them out.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Why did you not obey the LORD? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the LORD?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">"But I did obey the LORD," Saul said. "I went on the mission the LORD assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the LORD your God at Gilgal."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But Samuel replied: "Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has rejected you as king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned. I violated the LORD's command and your instructions. I was afraid of the people and so I gave in to them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">But Samuel said to him, "I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you as king over Israel!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors-to one better than you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a man, that he should change his mind."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Saul replied, "I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">Then Samuel said, "Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites." Agag came to him confidently, thinking, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">But Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women." And Samuel put Agag to death before the LORD at Gilgal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the LORD was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
<VERS vnumber="1">The LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">But Samuel said, "How can I go? Saul will hear about it and kill me." The LORD said, "Take a heifer with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Samuel did what the LORD said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, "Do you come in peace?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Samuel replied, "Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me." Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, "Surely the LORD's anointed stands here before the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, "The LORD has not chosen this one either."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, "Nor has the LORD chosen this one."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, "The LORD has not chosen these."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So he asked Jesse, "Are these all the sons you have?There is still the youngest," Jesse answered, "but he is tending the sheep." Samuel said, "Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">So he sent and had him brought in. He was ruddy, with a fine appearance and handsome features. Then the LORD said, "Rise and anoint him; he is the one."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the LORD came upon David in power. Samuel then went to Ramah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Now the Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD tormented him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Saul's attendants said to him, "See, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Let our lord command his servants here to search for someone who can play the harp. He will play when the evil spirit from God comes upon you, and you will feel better."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">So Saul said to his attendants, "Find someone who plays well and bring him to me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">One of the servants answered, "I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the harp. He is a brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And the LORD is with him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me your son David, who is with the sheep."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much, and David became one of his armor-bearers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, "Allow David to remain in my service, for I am pleased with him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take his harp and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him.</VERS>

<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Socoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. He was over nine feet tall.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, "Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Then the Philistine said, "This day I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul's time he was old and well advanced in years.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Now Jesse said to his son David, "Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Early in the morning David left the flock with a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and greeted his brothers.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">When the Israelites saw the man, they all ran from him in great fear.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Now the Israelites had been saying, "Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his father's family from taxes in Israel."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">David asked the men standing near him, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, "This is what will be done for the man who kills him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, "Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">"Now what have I done?" said David. "Can't I even speak?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">David said to Saul, "Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">Saul replied, "You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a boy, and he has been a fighting man from his youth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">But David said to Saul, "Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine." Saul said to David, "Go, and the LORD be with you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. "I cannot go in these," he said to Saul, "because I am not used to them." So he took them off.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">He looked David over and saw that he was only a boy, ruddy and handsome, and he despised him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">He said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">"Come here," he said, "and I'll give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="45">David said to the Philistine, "You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="46">This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I'll strike you down and cut off your head. Today I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="47">All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give all of you into our hands."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="48">As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="49">Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="50">So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="51">David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the scabbard. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="52">Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="53">When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="54">David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="55">As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is that young man?" Abner replied, "As surely as you live, O king, I don't know."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="56">The king said, "Find out whose son this young man is."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="57">As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine's head.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="58">"Whose son are you, young man?" Saul asked him. David said, "I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
<VERS vnumber="1">After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father's house.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Whatever Saul sent him to do, David did it so successfully that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the people, and Saul's officers as well.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with tambourines and lutes.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">As they danced, they sang: "Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Saul was very angry; this refrain galled him. "They have credited David with tens of thousands," he thought, "but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">And from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">The next day an evil spirit from God came forcefully upon Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the harp, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">and he hurled it, saying to himself, "I'll pin David to the wall." But David eluded him twice.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had left Saul.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">In everything he did he had great success, because the LORD was with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the LORD." For Saul said to himself, "I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">But David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">So when the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Now Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">"I will give her to him," he thought, "so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." So Saul said to David, "Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then Saul ordered his attendants: "Speak to David privately and say, 'Look, the king is pleased with you, and his attendants all like you; now become his son-in-law.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">They repeated these words to David. But David said, "Do you think it is a small matter to become the king's son-in-law? I'm only a poor man and little known."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">When Saul's servants told him what David had said,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Saul replied, "Say to David, 'The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.'" Saul's plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented the full number to the king so that he might become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success than the rest of Saul's officers, and his name became well known.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
<VERS vnumber="1">Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan was very fond of David</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">and warned him, "My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I'll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, "Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The LORD won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: "As surely as the LORD lives, David will not be put to death."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But an evil spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the harp,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Saul sent men to David's house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, warned him, "If you don't run for your life tonight, tomorrow you'll be killed."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats' hair at the head.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, "He is ill."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, "Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats' hair.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Saul said to Michal, "Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?" Michal told him, "He said to me, 'Let me get away. Why should I kill you?'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Word came to Saul: "David is in Naioth at Ramah";</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came upon Saul's men and they also prophesied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Secu. And he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?Over in Naioth at Ramah," they said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even upon him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">He stripped off his robes and also prophesied in Samuel's presence. He lay that way all that day and night. This is why people say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
<VERS vnumber="1">Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, "What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to take my life?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">"Never!" Jonathan replied. "You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn't do anything, great or small, without confiding in me. Why would he hide this from me? It's not so!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But David took an oath and said, "Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, 'Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.' Yet as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you want me to do, I'll do for you."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So David said, "Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">If your father misses me at all, tell him, 'David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">If he says, 'Very well,' then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the LORD. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">"Never!" Jonathan said. "If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">David asked, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">"Come," Jonathan said, "let's go out into the field." So they went there together.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Then Jonathan said to David: "By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">But if my father is inclined to harm you, may the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away safely. May the LORD be with you as he has been with my father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">But show me unfailing kindness like that of the LORD as long as I live, so that I may not be killed,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family-not even when the LORD has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "May the LORD call David's enemies to account."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Then Jonathan said to David: "Tomorrow is the New Moon festival. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then I will send a boy and say, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I say to him, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,' then come, because, as surely as the LORD lives, you are safe; there is no danger.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But if I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then you must go, because the LORD has sent you away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">And about the matter you and I discussed-remember, the LORD is witness between you and me forever."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon festival came, the king sat down to eat.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan, and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's place was empty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, "Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean-surely he is unclean."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">But the next day, the second day of the month, David's place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, "Why hasn't the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Jonathan answered, "David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">He said, 'Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.' That is why he has not come to the king's table."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">Saul's anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, "You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don't I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he must die!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">"Why should he be put to death? What has he done?" Jonathan asked his father.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the month he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father's shameful treatment of David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">and he said to the boy, "Run and find the arrows I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">When the boy came to the place where Jonathan's arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, "Isn't the arrow beyond you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">Then he shouted, "Hurry! Go quickly! Don't stop!" The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">(The boy knew nothing of all this; only Jonathan and David knew.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, "Go, carry them back to town."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together-but David wept the most.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.'" Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
<VERS vnumber="1">David went to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he met him, and asked, "Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">David answered Ahimelech the priest, "The king charged me with a certain matter and said to me, 'No one is to know anything about your mission and your instructions.' As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But the priest answered David, "I don't have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here-provided the men have kept themselves from women."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">David replied, "Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever I set out. The men's things are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the LORD and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Now one of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the LORD; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul's head shepherd.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">David asked Ahimelech, "Don't you have a spear or a sword here? I haven't brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king's business was urgent."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">The priest replied, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one." David said, "There is none like it; give it to me."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But the servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David, the king of the land? Isn't he the one they sing about in their dances: "'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Achish said to his servants, "Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?"</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
<VERS vnumber="1">David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father's household heard about it, they went down to him there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, "Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">But the prophet Gad said to David, "Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah." So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul, spear in hand, was seated under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing around him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Saul said to them, "Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul's officials, said, "I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Ahimelech inquired of the LORD for him; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and his father's whole family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Saul said, "Listen now, son of Ahitub.Yes, my lord," he answered.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Saul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">Ahimelech answered the king, "Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king's son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father's family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">But the king said, "You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and your father's whole family."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Then the king ordered the guards at his side: "Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing, yet they did not tell me." But the king's officials were not willing to raise a hand to strike the priests of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The king then ordered Doeg, "You turn and strike down the priests." So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">He also put to the sword Nob, the town of the priests, with its men and women, its children and infants, and its cattle, donkeys and sheep.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">But Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech son of Ahitub, escaped and fled to join David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Then David said to Abiathar: "That day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your father's whole family.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Stay with me; don't be afraid; the man who is seeking your life is seeking mine also. You will be safe with me."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
<VERS vnumber="1">When David was told, "Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors,"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">he inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go and attack these Philistines?" The LORD answered him, "Go, attack the Philistines and save Keilah."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">But David's men said to him, "Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Once again David inquired of the LORD, and the LORD answered him, "Go down to Keilah, for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, "God has handed him over to me, for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">And Saul called up all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">David said, "O LORD, God of Israel, your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD, God of Israel, tell your servant." And the LORD said, "He will."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Again David asked, "Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?" And the LORD said, "They will."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">David stayed in the desert strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that Saul had come out to take his life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">And Saul's son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"Don't be afraid," he said. "My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">The two of them made a covenant before the LORD. Then Jonathan went home, but David remained at Horesh.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Now, O king, come down whenever it pleases you to do so, and we will be responsible for handing him over to the king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Saul replied, "The LORD bless you for your concern for me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Go and make further preparation. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there. They tell me he is very crafty.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">Find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information. Then I will go with you; if he is in the area, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
<VERS vnumber="1">After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, "David is in the Desert of En Gedi."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The men said, "This is the day the LORD spoke of when he said to you, 'I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.'" Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul's robe.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He said to his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the LORD."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">With these words David rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, "My lord the king!" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">He said to Saul, "Why do you listen when men say, 'David is bent on harming you'?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">This day you have seen with your own eyes how the LORD delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, 'I will not lift my hand against my master, because he is the LORD's anointed.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. Now understand and recognize that I am not guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">May the LORD judge between you and me. And may the LORD avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">As the old saying goes, 'From evildoers come evil deeds,' so my hand will not touch you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">May the LORD be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">When David finished saying this, Saul asked, "Is that your voice, David my son?" And he wept aloud.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">"You are more righteous than I," he said. "You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">You have just now told me of the good you did to me; the LORD delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the LORD reward you well for the way you treated me today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Now swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father's family."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Maon.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">His name was Nabal and his wife's name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband, a Calebite, was surly and mean in his dealings.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">While David was in the desert, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">So he sent ten young men and said to them, "Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">Say to him: 'Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours!</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">"'Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my young men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.'"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">When David's men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David's name. Then they waited.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Nabal answered David's servants, "Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">David's men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">David said to his men, "Put on your swords!" So they put on their swords, and David put on his. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">One of the servants told Nabal's wife Abigail: "David sent messengers from the desert to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Night and day they were a wall around us all the time we were herding our sheep near them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Abigail lost no time. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Then she told her servants, "Go on ahead; I'll follow you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">David had just said, "It's been useless-all my watching over this fellow's property in the desert so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">May God deal with David, be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">She fell at his feet and said: "My lord, let the blame be on me alone. Please let your servant speak to you; hear what your servant has to say.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">May my lord pay no attention to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name-his name is Fool, and folly goes with him. But as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my master sent.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">"Now since the LORD has kept you, my master, from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, may your enemies and all who intend to harm my master be like Nabal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my master, be given to the men who follow you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">Please forgive your servant's offense, for the LORD will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my master, because he fights the LORD's battles. Let no wrongdoing be found in you as long as you live.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my master will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the LORD your God. But the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">When the LORD has done for my master every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him leader over Israel,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">my master will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the LORD has brought my master success, remember your servant."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="32">David said to Abigail, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="33">May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="34">Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="35">Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, "Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="36">When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing until daybreak.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="37">Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="38">About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal and he died.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="39">When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Praise be to the LORD, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal's wrongdoing down on his own head." Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="40">His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, "David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="41">She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, "Here is your maidservant, ready to serve you and wash the feet of my master's servants."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="42">Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five maids, went with David's messengers and became his wife.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="43">David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="44">But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
<VERS vnumber="1">The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search there for David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the desert. When he saw that Saul had followed him there,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">David then asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, "Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?I'll go with you," said Abishai.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Abishai said to David, "Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of my spear; I won't strike him twice."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But David said to Abishai, "Don't destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the LORD's anointed and be guiltless?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">As surely as the LORD lives," he said, "the LORD himself will strike him; either his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">But the LORD forbid that I should lay a hand on the LORD's anointed. Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head, and let's go."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">So David took the spear and water jug near Saul's head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the LORD had put them into a deep sleep.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, "Aren't you going to answer me, Abner?" Abner replied, "Who are you who calls to the king?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">David said, "You're a man, aren't you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn't you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">What you have done is not good. As surely as the LORD lives, you and your men deserve to die, because you did not guard your master, the LORD's anointed. Look around you. Where are the king's spear and water jug that were near his head?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is that your voice, David my son?" David replied, "Yes it is, my lord the king."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">And he added, "Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Now let my lord the king listen to his servant's words. If the LORD has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. If, however, men have done it, may they be cursed before the LORD! They have now driven me from my share in the LORD's inheritance and have said, 'Go, serve other gods.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the LORD. The king of Israel has come out to look for a flea-as one hunts a partridge in the mountains."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted like a fool and have erred greatly."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">"Here is the king's spear," David answered. "Let one of your young men come over and get it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">The LORD rewards every man for his righteousness and faithfulness. The LORD delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the LORD's anointed.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">As surely as I valued your life today, so may the LORD value my life and deliver me from all trouble."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then Saul said to David, "May you be blessed, my son David; you will do great things and surely triumph." So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="27">
<VERS vnumber="1">But David thought to himself, "One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maoch king of Gath.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Then David said to Achish, "If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">David lived in Philistine territory a year and four months.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt.)</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Whenever David attacked an area, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">When Achish asked, "Where did you go raiding today?" David would say, "Against the Negev of Judah" or "Against the Negev of Jerahmeel" or "Against the Negev of the Kenites."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he thought, "They might inform on us and say, 'This is what David did.'" And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">Achish trusted David and said to himself, "He has become so odious to his people, the Israelites, that he will be my servant forever."</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="28">
<VERS vnumber="1">In those days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, "You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">David said, "Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do." Achish replied, "Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all the Israelites and set up camp at Gilboa.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Saul then said to his attendants, "Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her.There is one in Endor," they said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. "Consult a spirit for me," he said, "and bring up for me the one I name."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">But the woman said to him, "Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Saul swore to her by the LORD, "As surely as the LORD lives, you will not be punished for this."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">Then the woman asked, "Whom shall I bring up for you?Bring up Samuel," he said.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">The king said to her, "Don't be afraid. What do you see?" The woman said, "I see a spirit coming up out of the ground."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">"What does he look like?" he asked. "An old man wearing a robe is coming up," she said. Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?I am in great distress," Saul said. "The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned away from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">Samuel said, "Why do you consult me, now that the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">The LORD has done what he predicted through me. The LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors-to David.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">Because you did not obey the LORD or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the LORD has done this to you today.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">The LORD will hand over both Israel and you to the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The LORD will also hand over the army of Israel to the Philistines."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel's words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and night.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, "Look, your maidservant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">He refused and said, "I will not eat." But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate. That same night they got up and left.</VERS>

<VERS vnumber="1">The Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, and Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">As the Philistine rulers marched with their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The commanders of the Philistines asked, "What about these Hebrews?" Achish replied, "Is this not David, who was an officer of Saul king of Israel? He has already been with me for over a year, and from the day he left Saul until now, I have found no fault in him."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">But the Philistine commanders were angry with him and said, "Send the man back, that he may return to the place you assigned him. He must not go with us into battle, or he will turn against us during the fighting. How better could he regain his master's favor than by taking the heads of our own men?</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">Isn't this the David they sang about in their dances: "'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So Achish called David and said to him, "As surely as the LORD lives, you have been reliable, and I would be pleased to have you serve with me in the army. From the day you came to me until now, I have found no fault in you, but the rulers don't approve of you.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Turn back and go in peace; do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">"But what have I done?" asked David. "What have you found against your servant from the day I came to you until now? Why can't I go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">Achish answered, "I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God; nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, 'He must not go up with us into battle.'</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">Now get up early, along with your master's servants who have come with you, and leave in the morning as soon as it is light."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="30">
<VERS vnumber="1">David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">and had taken captive the women and all who were in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">When David and his men came to Ziklag, they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">David's two wives had been captured-Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the LORD his God.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Bring me the ephod." Abiathar brought it to him,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">and David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them?Pursue them," he answered. "You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Ravine, where some stayed behind,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">for two hundred men were too exhausted to cross the ravine. But David and four hundred men continued the pursuit.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat-</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">David asked him, "To whom do you belong, and where do you come from?" He said, "I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="14">We raided the Negev of the Kerethites and the territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="15">David asked him, "Can you lead me down to this raiding party?" He answered, "Swear to me before God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="16">He led David down, and there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="17">David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them got away, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="18">David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="19">Nothing was missing: young or old, boy or girl, plunder or anything else they had taken. David brought everything back.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="20">He took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, "This is David's plunder."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="21">Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Ravine. They came out to meet David and the people with him. As David and his men approached, he greeted them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="22">But all the evil men and troublemakers among David's followers said, "Because they did not go out with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered. However, each man may take his wife and children and go."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="23">David replied, "No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and handed over to us the forces that came against us.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="24">Who will listen to what you say? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="25">David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="26">When David arrived in Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends, saying, "Here is a present for you from the plunder of the LORD's enemies."</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="27">He sent it to those who were in Bethel, Ramoth Negev and Jattir;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="28">to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="29">and Racal; to those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites and the Kenites;</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="30">to those in Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athach</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="31">and Hebron; and to those in all the other places where David and his men had roamed.</VERS>
</CHAPTER>
<CHAPTER cnumber="31">
<VERS vnumber="1">Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="2">The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="3">The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him critically.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="4">Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me." But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="5">When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died with him.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="6">So Saul and his three sons and his armor-bearer and all his men died together that same day.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="7">When the Israelites along the valley and those across the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="8">The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="9">They cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and they sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="10">They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="11">When the people of Jabesh Gilead heard of what the Philistines had done to Saul,</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="12">all their valiant men journeyed through the night to Beth Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh, where they burned them.</VERS>
<VERS vnumber="13">Then they took their bones and buried them under a tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.</VERS>
