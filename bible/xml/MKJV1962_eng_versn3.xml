    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">How alone sits the city [that was] full of people! She has become like a widow, [once] great among the nations, a noblewoman among the nations, [but now] has become a tribute-payer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">She bitterly weeps in the night, and her tears [are] on her cheeks; among all her lovers, she has none to comfort her. All her friends have dealt deceitfully with her; they became her enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Judah went into captivity because of affliction, and from great slavery. She dwells among the nations; she finds no rest; all her pursuers have overtaken her between the narrows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The roads of Zion mourn without [any] going to the appointed feasts. All her gates are deserted; her priests sigh; her virgins are afflicted, and she [is] in bitterness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her enemies have become as chief; her haters are at ease; for the LORD has afflicted her for the multitude of her sins. Her children have gone, captive before the enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty has departed. Her rulers have become like bucks: they find no pasture, and they have gone without strength before the pursuer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">[In the] days of her affliction and her wandering Jerusalem remembered all her desirable things from previous days; when her people fell into the hand of the foe; and there is no ally for her. The foes saw her; they laughed at her annihilation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jerusalem has grievously sinned, therefore she has been removed. All knowing her despise her because they saw her nakedness; yea, she sighs and turns backward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her uncleanness [is] in her skirts; she did not remember her end, and has gone down astoundingly. There is no comforter for her. O LORD, behold my affliction, for the enemy has magnified [himself].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The enemy has spread out his hand upon all her desirable things; for she has seen the nations enter her holy place, whom You commanded that they should not enter into Your congregation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All her people sigh; they seek bread. They have given their desirable things for food to relieve the soul. See, O LORD, and look on [me], for I have become vile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">[Is it] nothing to you, all you who pass by? Behold and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow which is done to me, with which the LORD has afflicted [me] in the day of His fierce anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From above He has sent fire into my bones and it has laid them low. He has spread a net for my feet; He has turned me back; He has made me amazed [and] faint all the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand; they intertwine; they rise on my neck. He has made my strength to falter; the LORD has delivered me into [their] hands. I am not able to rise up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The LORD has trampled all my mighty ones in my midst; He has called a gathering against me to crush my young men. The LORD has trod the virgin daughter of Judah, [as] in a winepress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For these I weep; my eye, my eye runs down [with] water, because the comforter who could refresh my soul is far from me. My sons are desolated because the enemy prevails.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Zion spreads forth her hands; none [is] comforting to me; the LORD has commanded concerning Jacob that his enemies [should be] all around him; Jerusalem has become as an impure thing among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The LORD [is] righteous, for I have rebelled against His command. I beseech you, all peoples, hear and behold my sorrow. My virgins and my young men went into exile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I called for my lovers, [but] they deceived me; my priests and my elders expired in the city while they sought food for them to bring back their life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Behold, O LORD, for I [am] in trouble; my inward parts ferment; my heart is turned within me, for I have grievously rebelled. On the outside the sword bereaves; in the house [it is] as death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They hear that I sigh; [there is] none to comfort me. All my enemies have heard my evil; they are glad that You have done [it]. You will bring the day [that] You have called, and they shall be like me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Let all their wickedness come before You; and do to them as You have done to me for all my transgressions. For my sighs [are] many, and my heart [is] faint.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in His anger! He cast down the beauty of Israel from the heavens to the earth and remembered not His footstool in the day of His anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Lord swallowed up all the dwelling-places of Jacob [and] has not pitied. In His wrath He has thrown down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He has brought [them] down to the ground. He has defiled the kingdom and its rulers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He has cut off all the horn of Israel in [His] fierce anger; He has drawn back His right hand from before the enemy, and He burned against Jacob like flaming fire [which] devours all around.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He has bent His bow like an enemy; [He stood with] His right hand like an adversary, and killed all [who were] desirable to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion. He poured out His fury like fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The LORD was like an enemy; He swallowed up Israel; He has swallowed up all her palaces, [and] destroyed His strongholds. And [He] has increased mourning and weeping in the daughter of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And He violated His booth like a garden, [and] destroyed His meeting places. The LORD caused the meeting places and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and He despised the king and the priest in the fury of His anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The LORD has cast off His altar; He rejected His sanctuary; He has given up the walls of her palaces into the hater's hand. They gave a noise in the house of the LORD, as a day of meeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The LORD purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion; He has stretched out a line; He has not withdrawn His hand from swallowing, and He made rampart and wall lament; they languish together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her gates have sunk in the ground; He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her kings and her rulers [are] among the nations. The law is no more; also her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground and [are] silent; they send up dust on their heads; they gird on sackclothes. The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My eyes fail with tears; my inward parts ferment; my liver is poured on the ground for the ruin of the daughter of my people, in that the children and the babies faint in the streets of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They say to their mothers, Where [are] grain and wine? In their fainting [they are] like the wounded in the streets of the city, in their pouring out their lives to their mothers' bosom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">What can I testify for you? What thing shall I compare to you, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I equal to you, so that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your break [is] great like the sea! Who can heal you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Your prophets have seen false and foolish things for you, and they have not uncovered your iniquity, to turn away your captivity; but they have seen false oracles and seductions for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">All who pass by clap [their] hands at you; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, [saying], Is this the city which they called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">All your enemies have opened their mouth against you; they hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed [her] up. Certainly this [is] the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The LORD has done [what] He has purposed; He has fulfilled His word which He commanded from the days of old. He has thrown down and not pitied. And He caused your hater to rejoice over you; He has set up the horn of your foes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Their heart cried to the LORD. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a torrent day and night; give yourself no rest. Let not the daughter of your eye cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Arise, cry out in the night. At the beginning of the watches, pour out your heart like water before the face of the LORD. Lift up your hands toward Him for the life of your children who are faint for hunger in the head of every street.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom You have done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, children of tender care? Shall the priest and the prophet be killed in the holy place of the Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Young and old lie on the ground in the streets; my virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword. You have killed [them] in the day of Your anger; You have killed and not pitied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You have called as in a solemn day my terrors all around, and there was not an escaped one or a survivor in the day of the LORD's anger. Those whom I have nursed and multiplied, my enemy has consumed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I the man have seen affliction by the rod of His wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He has led me and made [me] go in darkness and not into light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Surely He turned [against me]; He turns His hand all the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He has wasted my flesh and my skin; He has broken my bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He built against me and has circled [me] with bitterness and hardship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He has made me live in dark places, like the dead of old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He has set a fence around me and I cannot go out; He has made my bronze [chain] heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Also when I cry and shout, He shuts out my prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He walled up my ways with cut stone; my paths are crooked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He [was] a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in secret places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He has turned my ways aside and torn me in pieces. He made me desolate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He has bent His bow and set me as a mark for the arrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He has caused the arrows of His quiver to enter into my inward parts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I was a mockery to all my people, their song all the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He has filled me with bitterness [and] made me drunk [with] wormwood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He also broke my teeth with gravel; He has covered me in the ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And You cast off my soul from peace; I have forgotten blessedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I said, My strength and my hope from the LORD [are] gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Remember my affliction and my wandering, [as] wormwood and bitterness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">[It is] good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He sits alone and keeps silence because He laid [it] on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He puts his mouth in the dust, if perhaps there may be hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He gives [his] cheek to Him who strikes him; he is filled with reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For the Lord will not cast off forever;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">for though He causes grief, yet He will have pity according to the multitude of His kindnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For He does not afflict from His heart, nor does He grieve the sons of men;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">to crush all the prisoners of the earth under his feet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High;</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">How the gold has become dim; the fine gold has changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it happened in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">On the fifth of the month, the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Coming the Word of Jehovah became known] to Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, the priest in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar. And the hand of the LORD was on him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I looked, and behold, a windstorm came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire flashing itself, and a brightness to it all around, and out of its midst, like the color of polished bronze out of the middle of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Also out of its midst [came] the likeness of four living creatures. And this [was] how they looked; they had the likeness of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And four faces [were] to each, and four wings to each.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And their feet [were] straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot. And they sparkled like the color of burnished copper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the [hands] of a man [extended] from under their wings on their four sides; and the four of them [had] their faces and their wings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">joining each one to the other [by] their wings. They did not turn in their going; each one went toward the front of their face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the likeness of their faces: the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right [side] to the four of them; and the face of an ox on the left side to the four of them; and the face of an eagle to the four of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So their faces [were]. And their wings [were] stretched upward; to each, the two [wings] of each one were joined; and two [wings] covered their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And each went toward the front of their faces. To where the spirit was to go, there they went; they did not turn in their going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the likeness of the living creatures: they looked like burning coals of fire; like the appearance of torches. It was continually circling among the living creatures. And the fire [was] bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the living creatures kept running and returning, like the appearance of a flash of lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And as I looked at the living creatures, behold, one wheel [was] on the earth by the living creatures, with its four faces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship [was] the color of beryl, and the four of them had one likeness. And their appearance and their workmanship [was] like a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they went, they went on their four sides; [and] they did not turn when they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And their rims: they [were] even high; they were even awesome. And their rims [were] full of eyes all around the four of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And in the going of the living creatures, the wheels went beside them; and in the lifting up of the living creatures from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wherever the spirit was to go, there they went; there the spirit [was] to go, and the wheels were lifted up along with them. For the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In their going, [these] went; and in their standing still, these stood still. And in their lifting up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up along with them. For the spirit of the living creature [was] in the wheels.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Word of the LORD came again to me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they fornicated in Egypt; they whored in their youth, their breasts were handled, and there their virgin nipples were worked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And their names [were] Oholah, the oldest, and Oholibah, her sister. And they were Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And their names: Samaria [is] Oholah, and Jerusalem [is] Oholibah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Oholah whored under Me. And she lusted after her lovers, to [her] Assyrian neighbors,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">clothed with purple, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So she bestowed her harlotries on them, the choice sons of Assyria; [with] all of them, and with all whom she lusted after; she defiled herself with all their idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nor did she leave her fornications from Egypt. For in her youth they lay with her, and they worked her virgin nipples, and poured their fornications on her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore I have given her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians on whom she lusted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters and killed her with the sword. And she became notorious among women, and they executed judgment on her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And her sister Oholibah saw, she was more corrupt in her lustfulness than she, and her fornications were greater than her sister's whoredom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She lusted to the sons of Assyria, governors and rulers nearby, clothed most perfectly; horsemen riding horses, all of them desirable young men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I saw that she was defiled, one way [was] to both of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And she added to her fornications. And she saw men carved on the wall; images of the Chaldeans engraved with vermilion,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">girded with girdles on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like rulers, like the sons of Babylon [in] Chaldea, the land of their birth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and she lusted after them, to the look of her eyes, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with fornications. And she was defiled with them, and her mind was alienated from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So she uncovered her fornications and uncovered her nakedness. And My soul was alienated from her just as My soul was alienated from her sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet she multiplied her fornications to recall the days of her youth, in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And she lusted on her lovers, whose flesh is like the flesh of asses and whose issue [is like] the issue of horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So you longed for the wickedness of your youth, when the Egyptians worked your nipples, for the sake of the breasts of your youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So, O Oholibah, the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, I will raise up against you your lovers, from whom your soul is alienated; and I will bring them against you from all around;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">the Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, [and] all the Assyrians with them; all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, all of them, third heads and called ones; all of them riding on horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they shall come against you [with] weapons, chariots, and wheels, and with an assembly of peoples; buckler and shield and helmet shall set against you all around. And I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge you by their judgments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And I will set My jealousy against you, and they shall deal with you in fury. They shall take away your nose and your ears, and the rest of you shall fall by the sword. They shall take away your sons and your daughters, and the rest of you shall be devoured by the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They shall also strip you [of] your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So I will make your wickedness to cease from you, and your fornication from the land of Egypt. And you shall not lift up your eyes to them, nor shall you remember Egypt any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For so says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give you into the hand of [those] whom you hate, into the hand of whom your soul was alienated, from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And they shall deal with you in hatred, and shall take away all your labor, and shall leave you naked and bare. And the nakedness of your fornications shall be uncovered, both your wickedness and your fornications.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">These [things] will be done to you because you have whored after the nations, and because you are defiled with their idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So says the Lord Jehovah: You shall drink of your sister's cup deep and large; you shall be laughed to scorn and mocked; for it holds much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">[In] drunkenness and sorrow you are filled, the cup of horror and ruin, the cup of your sister Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You shall even drink it and empty it. And you shall break its pieces, and tear off your own breasts. For I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So the Lord Jehovah says this: Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, therefore bear also your wickedness and your adulteries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the LORD said to me: Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah, and declare to them their abominations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">that they have committed adultery, and blood [is] on their hands? And they have committed adultery with their idols and have also caused their sons whom they bore to Me to pass through the fire to them, to devour them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And yet they have done this to Me: They have defiled My sanctuary in that day, and have profaned My sabbaths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when they had slain their sons to their idols, then they came into My sanctuary in that day to profane it. And lo, this they have done in the midst of My house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And they have even sent for men to come from far, to whom a messenger [was] sent. And lo, they came. You washed yourself for them, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">and sat on a stately bed with a table prepared before it, on which you set My incense and My oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the sound of a crowd [was] at ease with her; and drunkards from the wilderness were brought with the men of the host of mankind; and they put bracelets on their hands, and crowns of beauty on their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And I said about the one worn [in] adulteries, Will they now whore with her, and she [with them] ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And they went in to her, as [they] go in to a woman of harlotry; so they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the wicked women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And [as] righteous men, they shall judge them [with] the judgment of adulteresses, and the judgment of women who shed blood; because they [are] adulteresses, and blood [is] in their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For so says the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up a company on them, and will give them to be removed and stripped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And the company shall stone them [with] stones, and cut them down with their swords. They shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">So I will cause wickedness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught, even not to go after your wickedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And they shall put your wickedness on you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols. And you shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth of the month, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Son of man, write for yourself the name of the day, even of this same day. The king of Babylon has leaned toward Jerusalem this same day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And speak a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Set on a pot; set [it] on, and also pour water into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Gather its pieces into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder. Fill [it with] the choice bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Take the choice of the flock, and also burn the bones under it; make it boil high, and let them boil its bones in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the Lord Jehovah says this: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum [is] in it, and whose scum has not gone out of it! Bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For her blood is in her midst; she set it on the top of a rock. She did not pour it on the ground, to cover it [with] dust,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance. I have set her blood on a shining rock, that it should not be covered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So the Lord Jehovah says this: Woe to the bloody city! I will even heap on the pile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And heap on the wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and mix in the spice, and let the bones be burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And set it empty on its coals, so that its bronze may be hot and may glow, and [that] its uncleanness may be melted in it, [that] the scum of it may be burned away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She has wearied [herself] with lies, and her great scum did not go out from her. Her scum [shall be] in the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In your defilement [is] wickedness. Because I have purged you and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your defilement any more, until I have caused My fury to cease on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I the LORD have spoken. It shall come, and I will do [it]. I will not let go, nor will I spare, nor will I repent. According to your ways, and according to your doings, they shall judge you, says the Lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Groan [but] be silent; make no mourning [for] the dead; tie your turban on you, and put your sandals on your feet, and do not cover [your] lips, and do not eat the bread of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So I spoke to the people in the morning. And in the evening my wife died, and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these [things mean] to us, that you do so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I answered them, The Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Speak to the house of Israel. So says the Lord Jehovah: behold, I will defile My sanctuary, the glory of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities. And your sons and your daughters whom you have left shall fall by the sword.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">So says the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to the grave, I caused a mourning.

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god. And he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs that he should bring [some] of the sons of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the rulers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">sons [in] whom was no blemish, but who were handsome and skillful in all wisdom; and who had knowledge and understanding, even those who were able to stand in the king's palace, and to whom they might teach the writing and the language of the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king gave them the portion of a day in its day from the king's food, and the wine which he drank, even to rear them three years, so that at their end they might stand before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And among them were [four] of the sons of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">to whom the ruler of the eunuchs gave names. For he called Daniel, Belteshazzar; and Hananiah, Shadrach; and Mishael, Meshach; and Azariah, Abednego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Daniel laid on his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank. So he asked permission of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And God had given Daniel kindness and compassion before the chief of the eunuchs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has chosen your food and your drink. For why should he see your faces worse looking than the boys who [are] of your kind? Then you would forfeit my head to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Daniel said to Melzar, whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I beg you, try your servants ten days. And let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then let our look be seen before you, and the look of the boys who eat of the king's food. And as you see, deal with your servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So he listened to them in this matter, and tried them for ten days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And at the end of ten days their faces looked fairer and fatter in flesh than all the boys who had eaten the king's food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Melzar took away their part of the food, and the wine that they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">As for these four boys, God gave them knowledge and skill in all writing and wisdom. And Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And at the end of the days that the king had said he would bring them in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the king talked with them. And among them all were found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they stood before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And [in] any matters of wisdom [and] understanding that the king asked them, he found them ten times better than all the horoscopists [and] conjurers who were in all his kingdom.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And in the second year of the reign of king Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the king commanded to call to the horoscopists, and to the conjurers, and to the sorcerers, and to the Chaldeans, to tell to the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the Chaldeans spoke to the king [in] Aramaic, O king, live forever. Tell your servants the dream, and we will reveal the meaning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing has gone from me. If you will not make known to me the dream, with its meaning, you will be made into [mere] members, and your houses shall be made an outhouse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if you make known the dream and its meaning, you shall receive gifts and a present and great honor from me. Therefore reveal to me the dream and its meaning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will reveal its meaning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The king answered and said, For I know that you surely want to gain time, because you see the thing is gone from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if you will not make the dream known to me, [there is] only one judgment for you. For you have prepared lying and deceiving words to speak before me, until the time has changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can reveal to me its meaning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Chaldeans answered before the king and said, There is not a man on the earth who can reveal the king's matter, because not any king, lord, nor ruler has asked such a thing from any horoscopist or conjurer or Chaldean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And [it is] a rare thing that the king asks, and there is no other who can reveal it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For this cause the king was enraged and angered, and commanded all the wise men of Babylon to be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the law went out that the wise men should be killed. And they sought Daniel and his fellows to be killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Daniel answered [with] counsel and insight to Arioch the chief of the king's executioners, who had gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Daniel went in and asked of the king that he would give him time, and that he would make known the meaning to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that they might pray for the mercies of God in Heaven concerning this secret, that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. And Daniel blessed the God of Heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and might are His.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And He changes the times and the seasons; He removes kings and sets up kings. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He reveals the deep and secret things; He knows what [is] in the darkness, and the light dwells with Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I thank You, and praise You, O God of my fathers, who has given me wisdom and might, and have made known to me now what we asked of You. For You have now made known to us the king's matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had chosen to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said this to him; Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will declare the meaning to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel in before the king, and said this to him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah who will make the meaning known to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its meaning?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Daniel answered before the king and said, The secret which the king has demanded cannot be shown to the king by the wise men, the conjurers, the horoscopists, or the fortune-tellers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But there is a God in Heaven who reveals secrets and makes known to King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon your bed [are] these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As for you, O king, your thoughts came on your bed, what should happen after this. And He who reveals secrets makes known to you what shall happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for [any] wisdom that I have more than any living man, but so that the meaning might be known to the king, and that you might know the thoughts of your heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">You, O king, were seeing. And, behold! A great image! That great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before you. And its form [was] dreadful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This image's head [was] of fine gold; his breast and his arms [were] of silver; his belly and his thighs [were] of bronze;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">his legs [were] of iron; his feet [were] part of iron and part of clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You watched until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image upon its feet [which were] of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were broken to pieces together. And they became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors. And the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This [is] the dream. And we will tell its meaning before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">You, O king, [are] a king of kings. For the God of Heaven has given you a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And wherever the sons of men, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens live, He has given [them] into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all. You are this head of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And after you shall arise another kingdom lower than you, and another third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And the fourth kingdom shall be [as] strong as iron. Since iron crushes and smashes all things; and as the iron that shatters all these, it will crush and shatter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And as to that which you saw: the feet and toes, part of potters' clay and part of iron; [the] kingdom shall be divided. But there shall be in it the strength of the iron, because you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And [as] the toes of the feet [were] part of iron and part of clay, [so] the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And as you saw iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mix themselves with the seed of men. But they shall not cling to one another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And in the days of these kings, the God of Heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be left to other peoples, but it shall crush and destroy all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Because you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it crushes the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what shall occur after this. And the dream  is] certain, and its meaning is sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshiped Daniel, and he commanded to offer an offering and incense to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The king answered Daniel and said, It is true that your God [is] a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over all the province of Babylon, and chief of the prefects over all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And Daniel asked the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But Daniel [sat] in the gate of the king.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Then at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accused the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They spoke and said to king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You, O king, have made a decree that every man who shall hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and the bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And whoever does not fall down and worship, he should be thrown into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There are men, Jews, whom you have set over the business of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, do not heed you. They do not serve your gods nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Nebuchadnezzar in anger and wrath commanded them to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, [Is it] true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego? Do you not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now if you are ready, at the time you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, fall down and worship the image which I have made. But if you do not worship, in that moment you shall be thrown into the middle of a burning fiery furnace. And who is that god who shall deliver you out of my hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we [have] no need to return a word to you on this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If it is [so that] our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, then He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and the form of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He spoke and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he commanded mighty men in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to throw [them] into the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then these men were tied up in their slippers, their tunics, and their mantles, and their [other] clothes, and were thrown into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was amazed. And he rose up in haste and spoke and said to his advisers, Did we not throw three men bound into the middle of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered and said, Behold! I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and there is no harm among them. And the form of the fourth is like a son of [the] gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near the door of the burning fiery furnace. He answered and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the most high God, come forth and come [here]. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth from the middle of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king's advisers gathered and saw these men [on whose] bodies the fire had no power (and the hair of their head was not scorched, nor were their slippers changed, nor had the smell of fire clung on them).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed [be] the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent His Angel and has delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and have changed the king's words and has given their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And a decree is given by me, that every people, nation, and language, who speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be made into mere members, and his house shall be made an outhouse. Because there is no other God who can deliver in this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the king made Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego prosper in the province of Babylon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It seemed good before me to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done with me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house and flourishing in my palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I saw a dream and it terrified me, and [the] thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the meaning of the dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then the horoscopists, the conjurers, the Chaldeans, and the fortune-tellers came in. And I told the dream before them, but they did not make its meaning known to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But at last Daniel came in before me, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom [is] the spirit of the holy gods. And I told the dream before him, [saying] ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">O Belteshazzar, master of the horoscopists, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods [is] in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its meaning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As to the visions of my head on my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height [was] great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The tree grew and was strong, and its height reached to the heavens; and the sight of it reached to the end of all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Its leaves [were] beautiful, and its fruit plentiful, and in it [was] food for all. The animals of the field sought shade under it, and the birds of the heavens lived in its boughs, and all flesh was fed by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from Heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He cried aloud and said this, Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches; shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals get away from under it, and the birds from its branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field. And let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion [be] with the animals in the grass of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let his heart be changed from man's, and let the heart of an animal be given to him. And let seven times pass over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones, so that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever He will, and sets up over it the lowest of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen this dream. Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare its meaning, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make the meaning known to me. But you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods [is] in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stunned for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke and said, Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream  is] to those who hate you, and its meaning to your foes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The tree that you saw, which became great and strong, whose height reached to the heaven, and the sight of it to all the earth;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">this [is] the meaning, O king, and this the decree of the Most High, which has come on my lord the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field, and they shall make you eat grass like oxen.

      <VERS vnumber="26">And in that they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; your kingdom [shall be] sure to you after you have known that Heaven rules.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore, O king, let my advice be pleasing to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor, whether there will be duration to your prosperity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">All this came on the king Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The king spoke and said, [Is] this not great Babylon that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my majesty?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">While the word [was] in the king's mouth, a voice fell from Heaven, saying, O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken. The kingdom has departed from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. They shall make you eat grass like oxen, and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever He will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The same hour the thing was fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar. And he was driven from men, and ate grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the heavens, until his hair had grown like eagles'  feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And at the end of days, I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to Heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored Him who lives forever, whose kingdom  is] an everlasting kingdom, and His rule is from generation to generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And all the people of the earth are counted as nothing; and He does according to His will in the army of heaven, and [among] the people of the earth. And none can strike His hand, or say to Him, What are You doing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">At that time my reason returned to me. And the glory of my kingdom, my honor and brightness returned to me. And my advisers and my lords came for me, and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and exalt and honor the King of heaven, all whose works are truth and His ways judgment. And those who walk in pride He is able to humble.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God in Jerusalem. And the king, and his rulers, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, and of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed. Then he wrote the dream and gave the sum of the matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Daniel spoke and said, In my vision by night I was looking: and behold, the four winds of the heavens were stirring up the Great Sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And four great beasts came up from the sea, different from one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The first was like a lion and had eagle's wings. I watched until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on its feet like a man. And a man's heart was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And behold another beast, a second, like a bear. And it raised itself up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And they said this to it: Arise, eat up much flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After this I saw, and lo, another, like a leopard, which [had] four wings of a bird on its back. The beast also [had] four heads; and rulership was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After this I looked in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, frightening and terrifying, and very strong. And it [had] great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet. And it [was] different from all the beasts before it; and it had ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I was thinking about the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom three of the first horns were uprooted. And behold, in this horn [were] eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I watched until the thrones were thrown up, and the Ancient of Days sat, whose robe [was] white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool. His throne [was] like flames of fire, and His wheels [like] burning fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A stream of fire went out and came out from before Him. A thousand thousands served Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The judgment was set, and the books were opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then I was looking because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke. I watched until the beast was slain, and his body was destroyed and given to the burning flame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away. Yet their lives were made longer for a season and time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the night visions, and behold, [One] like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought Him near before Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And dominion and glory was given Him, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations and languages, should serve Him. His dominion [is] an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I Daniel was distressed in My spirit in its body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I came near one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the meaning of the things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These four great beasts [are] four kings; they shall arise out of the earth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, [to] me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And in a vision I looked. And it happened when I looked, I [was] at Shushan the palace, which [is] in the province of Elam. And in a vision I looked, and I was by the Ulai Canal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked. And behold, a ram with [two] horns stood before the Canal [having] two horns, and the [two] horns were high, but one [was] higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward; so that no beasts could stand before him, nor any that could deliver out of his hand. But he did according to his will, and became great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as I was watching, behold, a he-goat came from the west, over the face of the all earth, and did not touch the ground. And the he goat [had] an outstanding horn between his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he came to the ram that [had two] horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran to him in the fury of his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I saw him come close beside the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram and shattered his two horns. And there was no power in the ram to stand before him. But he threw him down to the ground and stamped on him. And none could deliver the ram out of his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the he-goat became very great. And when he was strong, the great horn was broken. And in its place came up four outstanding [ones] towards the four winds of the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became very great, toward the south and toward the east and toward the bountiful [land].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And it became great, [even] to the host of heaven. And it made fall some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and trampled them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yea, he magnified himself, even to the ruler of the host, and the daily [sacrifice] was taken away by him, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And an army was given [to him] against the daily [sacrifice] because of transgression, and it cast the truth to the ground. And it worked and succeeded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard a certain holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that one who spoke, Until when shall the vision last, concerning the daily [sacrifice] and the transgression that astounds, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said to me, For two thousand, three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be vindicated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it happened when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me the form of a man.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">So he came near beside my place. And when he came, I was afraid and fell on my face. But he said to me, Understand, O son of man, for the vision [is] for the time of the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And as he was speaking with me, I was stunned, on my face toward the ground. But he touched me and set me upright.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">The ram which you saw having two horns [are] the kings of Media and Persia.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And as for that being broken, and four stood up in its place; four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in its power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king, fierce of face, and skilled at intrigues, shall stand up.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood the number of the years by books, which came of the Word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I set my face toward the Lord God, to seek by prayer and holy desires, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar. And the thing was true, and a great conflict. And he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">His body also [was] like the beryl, and his face looked like lightning. And his eyes [were] like lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet in color were like polished bronze, and the voice of his words like the sound of a multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision. For the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great quaking fell on them, so that they fled to hide themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me. For my beauty was turned within me to corruption, and I kept no strength.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">so that you may become sons of your Father in Heaven. For He makes His sun to rise on [the] evil and on [the] good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">But He answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign. And there shall be no sign given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the huge fish, so the Son of man shall be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, because they repented at the proclaiming of Jonah, and behold, [One] greater than Jonah [is] here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The queen of the south shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, [One] greater than Solomon [is] here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he walks through dry places seeking rest, and finds none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then he said, I will return into my house from where I came out. And when he has come, he finds [it] empty, swept, and decorated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and live there. And the last [state] of that man is worse than the first. Even so it also shall be to this evil generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But while He yet talked with the people, behold, [His] mother and His brothers stood outside, desiring to speak with Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Then one said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers stand outside, desiring to speak with You.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And He answered and said to him who told Him, Who is My mother? And who are My brothers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And He stretched out His hand toward His disciples and said, Behold, My mother and My brothers!</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In that day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the seaside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And great crowds were gathered to Him, so that He went into a boat and sat. And all the crowd stood on the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And as he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Some fell on stony places, where they did not have much earth. And they sprang up immediately, because they [had] no deepness of earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And [the] sun rising, they were scorched, and because they had no root, they withered away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And some fell among thorns. And the thorns sprung up and choked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And some fell on the good ground and yielded fruit, indeed one a hundredfold, and one sixty, and one thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the disciples said to Him, Why do You speak to them in parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered and said to them, Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance. But whoever does not have, from him shall be taken away even that which he has.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not; nor do they understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which said, By hearing you shall hear and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">for this people's heart has become gross, and [their] ears are dull of hearing, and they have closed their eyes, lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with [their ears and should understand with [their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But blessed [are] your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous [men] have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear what you hear, and have not heard them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore hear the parable of the sower.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When anyone hears the Word of the kingdom and does not understand [it,] then the wicked one comes and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown by the wayside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But that which was sown on the stony places is this: he who hears the Word and immediately receives it with joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he has no root in himself, and is temporary. For when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, he immediately stumbles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And that sown into the thorns is this: he who hears the Word; and the anxiety of this world, and the deceit of riches, choke the Word, and he becomes unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But that sown on the good ground is this: he who hears the Word and understands; who also bears fruit and produces one truly a hundredfold; and one sixty; and one thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He put out another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel among the wheat and went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But when the blade had sprung up and had produced fruit, then the darnel also appeared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then where have the darnel come from?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Then do you want us to go and gather them up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he said, No, lest while you gather up the darnel you also root up the wheat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Let both grow together until the harvest. And in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, First gather together the darnel and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my granary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He put out another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">which indeed is the least of all seeds, but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of Heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak to them without a parable,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then sending the crowds away, Jesus went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the darnel of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He answered and said to them, He who sows the good seed is the Son of man;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; but the darnel are the sons of the evil [one].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The enemy who sowed them is the Devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Therefore as the darnel are gathered and burned in the fire, so it shall be in the end of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Son of man shall send out His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who do iniquity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and shall cast them into a furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then the righteous shall shine out like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which when a man has found it, he hides it, and for the joy of it goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered some of every kind;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">So it shall be at the end of the world. The angels shall come out and separate the wicked from among the just,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and shall cast them into the furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Jesus said to them, Have you understood all these things? They said to Him, Yes, Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then He said to them, Therefore every scribe [who is] instructed to the kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out [things] new and old out of his treasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And it happened when Jesus finished these parables, He departed from there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And when He had come into His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so much so that they were astonished and said, From where does this [man have] this wisdom and these mighty works?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Is not this the carpenter's son? [Is] not his mother called Mary? And his brothers, James and Joses and Simon and Judas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">and his sisters, are they not all with us? Then from where does this [man have] all these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And they were offended in Him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and said to his servants, This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead, and therefore the powerful works [are] working in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For Herod had laid hold on John, and had bound him, and had put [him] in prison because of Herodias his brother Philip's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For John said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when he desired to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And she, being instructed before by her mother, said, Give me John the Baptist's head here on a platter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the king was sorry. But for the oath's sake, and those reclining with [him], he commanded [it] to be given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he sent and beheaded John in the prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl. And she brought [it] to her mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And his disciples came and took up the body and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Jesus heard, He departed from there by boat into a deserted place apart. And hearing, the crowds followed Him on foot out of the cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jesus went out and saw a great crowd, and He was moved with compassion toward them. And He healed their sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And evening coming on, His disciples came to Him, saying, The place is deserted and the time has already gone by. Send the crowd away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Jesus said to them, They do not need to leave, you give them [something] to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they said to Him, We have here only five loaves and two fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And He said, Bring them here to Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And He commanded the crowd to recline on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to Heaven He blessed and broke, and gave the loaves to [His] disciples. And the disciples [gave] to the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they all ate and were filled. And they took up twelve hand baskets full from the fragments that remained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And immediately Jesus constrained His disciples to get into a boat and to go before Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when He had sent the crowds away, He went up into a mountain apart to pray. And when evening had come, He was there alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the boat was now in [the] midst of the sea, tossed with waves; for the wind was against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a phantom! And they cried out for fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer, I AM! Do not fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Peter answered Him and said, LORD, if it is You, tell me to come to You on the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And He said, Come. And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But seeing that the wind was strong, he was afraid. And beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And immediately Jesus stretched out [His] hand and caught him; and said to him, Little-faith! Why did you doubt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And when they had come into the boat, the wind ceased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And those in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, Truly You are the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when they had passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And recognizing Him, the men of that place sent to all that neighborhood, and brought to Him all who were diseased.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and mother; and, He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him die by death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But you say, Whoever says to [his] father or mother, Whatever you would gain from me, [It is] a gift to God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and in no way he honors his father or his mother. And you voided the commandment of God by your tradition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This people draws near to Me with their mouth, and honors Me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But in vain they worship Me, teaching [for] doctrines [the] commandments of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And He called the crowd and said to them, Hear and understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then His disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Peter answered and said to Him, Explain this parable to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jesus said, Are you also still without understanding?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Do you not yet understand that whatever enters in at the mouth goes into the belly, and is cast out into [the] waste-bowl?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the things which come out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">these are [the things] which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And going out from there, Jesus withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And behold, a woman of Canaan coming out of these borders cried to Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and begged Him, saying, Send her away, for she cries after us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But He answered and said, I am not sent except to the lost sheep of [the] house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, Lord, help me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children's bread and to throw [it] to dogs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And she said, True, O Lord; but even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great [is] your faith! So be it to you even as you wish. And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And moving from there Jesus came beside the Sea of Galilee. And He went up into a mountain and sat there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And great crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others. And they cast them down at Jesus' feet. And He healed them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">so much so that the crowd wondered when they saw the dumb speak, the maimed sound, the lame walk, and the blind see. And they glorified the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then Jesus called His disciples and said, I have compassion on the crowd because they continue with Me for three days now and have nothing to eat. And I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And His disciples said to Him, From where should we [get] so many loaves in the wilderness, so as to fill so great a crowd?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few little fish.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Then His disciples understood that He spoke to them about John the Baptist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they came to the crowd, a man came to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and grievously vexed; for oftentimes he falls into the fire, and often into the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I brought him to Your disciples, and they could not cure him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him here to Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus rebuked the demon, and he departed out of him. And the child was cured from that very hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the disciples came to Jesus apart, and said, Why could we not cast him out?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief. For truly I say to you, If you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Move from here to there. And it shall move. And nothing shall be impossible to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And while they stayed in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they will kill Him, and the third day He will be raised again. And they grieved exceedingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they had come to Capernaum, those who received the didrachmas came to Peter and said, Does your master not pay the didrachmas?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said, Yes. And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? From their sons, or from strangers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Peter said to Him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then truly the sons are free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But lest we should offend them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. And when you have opened its mouth, you shall find a stater; take that, and give it to them for Me and you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">At that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who is the greater in the kingdom of Heaven?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jesus called a little child to Him and set him in their midst,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and said, Truly I say to you, Unless you are converted and become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of Heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore whoever shall humble himself like this little child, this one is the greater in the kingdom of Heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And whoever shall receive one such little child in My name receives Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But whoever shall offend one of these little [ones] who believes in Me, it would be better for him that an ass's millstone were hung around his neck, and he be sunk in the depth of the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Woe to the world because of offenses! For it is necessary that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And if your hand or your foot causes you to offend, cut them off and throw [them] from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And if your eye offends you, pluck it out and throw [it] from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Take heed [that] you do not despise one of these little [ones]. For I say to you that in Heaven their angels always behold the face of My Father in Heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the Son of man has come to save that which was lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them strays, does he not leave the ninety and nine [and] go into the mountains and seek the straying one?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And if it happens that he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety and nine which did not stray.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore the kingdom of Heaven has been compared to a certain king who desired to make an accounting with his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when he had begun to count, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But as he had nothing to pay, his lord commanded that he, and his wife and children, and all that he had, be sold, and payment be made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then the servant fell down and worshiped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me and I will pay you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the debt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. And he laid hands on him and took [him] by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, Have patience with me and I will pay you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he would not, but went and cast him into prison until he should pay the debt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry. And they came and told their lord all that was done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then his lord, after he had called him, said to him, O wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Should you not also have pitied your fellow servant, even as I had pity on you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors until he should pay all that was due to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also to you, unless each one of you from your hearts forgive his brother their trespasses.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it happened, when Jesus had finished these sayings, that He departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond Jordan.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">They said to Him, Why did Moses then command to give a bill of divorce and to put her away?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said to them, Because of your hard-heartedness Moses allowed you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her [who is] put away commits adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">His disciples said to Him, If this is the case of the man with [his] wife, it is not good to marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But He said to them, Not all receive this word, except [those] to whom it is given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For there are some eunuchs who were born so from [their] mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of Heaven's sake. He who is able to receive [it], let him receive it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then little children were brought to Him, that He should put [His] hands on them and pray. And the disciples rebuked them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And He said to him, Why do you call Me good? [There is] none good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said to Him, Which? Jesus said, You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">The young man said to Him, I have kept all these things from my youth up; what do I lack yet?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">For the kingdom of Heaven is like a man, a housemaster, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he went out about [the] sixth and ninth hour and did likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why do you stand here all day idle?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They said to him, Because no one has hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and you shall receive whatever is right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So when evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers and pay them [their] wage, beginning from the last to the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when they [who were hired about] the eleventh hour came, they each one received a denarius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But when the first came, they supposed that they would received more; and they also each one received a denarius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And receiving [it] they murmured against the master of the house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">saying, These last have worked [only] one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and heat of the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I do you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Take yours, and go; I will give to this last one the same as to you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said to them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And they shall deliver Him to the nations to mock and to scourge and to crucify. And the third day He shall rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then the mother of Zebedee's children came to Him with her sons, worshiping and desiring a certain thing from Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And He said to her, What do you desire? She said to Him, Grant that these my two sons may sit in Your kingdom, the one on Your right hand and the other on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Jesus answered and said, You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They said to Him, We are able.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And He said to them, You shall indeed drink of My cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but [to those] for whom it has been prepared by My Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when the ten heard [it], they were indignant concerning the two brothers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables, and said,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they would not come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Again he sent out other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatlings [are] killed, and all things [are] ready. Come to the marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But not caring, they went their ways, one to [his] field, another to [his] trading.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the rest took his servants and treated [them] spitefully, and killed [them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when the king heard, he was angry. And he sent out his armies and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then he said to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they who were invited were not worthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore go into the exits of the highways, and as many as you shall find, invite them to the marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the servants went out into the highways and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. And the wedding was filled with reclining guests.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Jesus said to them, All of you will be offended because of Me this night. For it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But after I have risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Peter answered and said to Him, though all shall be offended because of You, I will never be offended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that this night, before the cock crows, you shall deny Me three times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter said to Him, though I should die with You, yet I will not deny You. All the disciples also said the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane. And He said to the disciples, Sit here while I go and pray there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with Him, and He began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Wait here and watch with Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And He went a little further and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You [will].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And He came to the disciples and found them asleep. And [He] said to Peter, What! Could you not watch with Me one hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He went away again the second time and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cup may not pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And He left them and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then He came to His disciples and said to them, Sleep on now and take [your] rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into [the] hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Rise, let us be going; behold, he who is betraying Me is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And as He was yet speaking, behold, Judas came, one of the Twelve. And with him came a great crowd with swords and clubs, being sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he who betrayed Him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, He is the one, lay hold on Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And coming up to Jesus immediately, he said, Hail, Master! And [he] kissed Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And, behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out [his] hand and drew his sword, and he struck a servant of the high priest and [cut] off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then Jesus said to him, Put up your sword again into its place; for all who take [the] sword shall perish with a sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall presently give Me more than twelve legions of angels?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Have you come out in order to take Me with swords and clubs, as against a thief? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not lay hands on Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But all this happened that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples fled, forsaking Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And they who had seized Jesus led [Him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">But Peter followed Him afar off to the high priest's court, and he went in and sat with the servants to see the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And the chief priests and the elders and all the sanhedrin sought false witness against Jesus, in order to put Him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">But they found none; yea, though many false witnesses came, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came up</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">and said, This one said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And standing up, the high priest said to Him, Do you answer nothing? What [is it that] these witness against you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus was silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, I adjure you by the living God that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Jesus said to him, You said [it]. I tell you more. From this time you shall see the Son of man sitting on [the] right [hand] of power, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">What do you think? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then they spat in His face and beat Him with the fist. And others struck [Him] with the palms of their hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">saying, Prophesy to us, Christ; who is the [one] who struck you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">And Peter sat outside in the court. And a girl came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But he denied all before [them], saying, I do not know what you say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And when he had gone out into the porch, another saw him and said to those there, This one was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">And after a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, Surely you also are [one] of them, for your speech betrays you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then he began to curse and to swear, I do not know the man. And immediately the cock crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, Who said to him, Before the cock crows, you shall deny Me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And [it] becoming early morning, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when they had bound Him, they led [Him] away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then he who had betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, sorrowing, Judas returned the thirty pieces of silver again to the chief priests and elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">saying, I have sinned, betraying innocent blood. And they said, What [is that] to us? You see [to that].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he threw the pieces of silver down in the temple and departed. And he went and hanged himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is [the] price of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they took counsel and bought the potter's field with them, to bury strangers in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore that field was called, The Field of Blood, to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who had been priced, whom they of the children of Israel valued,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, Are you the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when He was accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Pilate said to Him, Do you not hear how many things they witness against you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And He did not answer him a word, so that the governor greatly marveled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now at [that] feast the governor was accustomed to release to the people a prisoner, whomever they desired.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they then had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you desire that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus [who is] called Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he knew they had delivered Him because of envy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But as he was sitting down on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that just man, for today because of Him I have suffered many things in a dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd that they should ask [for] Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The governor answered and said to them, Which of the two do you desire that I release [to] you? They said, Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? [They] all said to him, Let Him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the governor said, Why? What evil has He done? But they cried out the more, saying, let Him be crucified!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But when Pilate saw that it gained nothing, but rather [that] a tumult was made, he took water and washed [his] hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person. You see to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then all the people answered and said, Let His blood [be] on us and on our children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he released Barabbas to them. And when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered [Him] to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then taking Jesus into the praetorium, the soldiers of the governor gathered the cohort against Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And stripping Him, they put a scarlet robe around Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And plaiting a crown of thorns, they put [it] on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And spitting at Him, [they] took the reed and struck at His head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And after they had mocked Him, they took the robe off of Him and put His own clothing on Him and led Him away to crucify [Him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They forced this one to carry His cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And coming to a place called Golgotha, which is called, Place of a Skull,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">they gave Him vinegar mixed with gall to drink. And when He had tasted, He would not drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they crucified Him, dividing His garments, casting a lot; so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted My garments among them, and they cast a lot for My clothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And sitting down they guarded Him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they put up over His head His accusation, written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then two thieves were crucified with Him, one off [the] right, one off [the] left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And those who passed by blasphemed Him, shaking their heads,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and saying, [You] destroying the temple and building [it] in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And in the same way also the chief priests mocked, with the scribes and elders, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He saved others, but he cannot save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusted in God, let Him deliver him now, if He will have him. (For He said, I am [the] Son of God.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And also the thieves who were crucified with Him reviled Him, [saying] the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And from [the] sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until [the] ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? That is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Some of those who stood there, when they heard, said, This one calls for Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar, and he put [it] on a reed and gave it to Him to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The rest said, Let Him alone, let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And crying again with a loud voice, Jesus released [His] spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And, behold! The veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. And the earth quaked, and the rocks were sheared,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep arose,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and coming out of the tomb after His resurrection [they] went into the holy city and appeared to many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But the centurion and those guarding Jesus, seeing the earthquake, and the things that took place, [they] feared greatly, saying, Truly this One was Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And many of the women were there, watching from a distance, [those] who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him, watching from a distance;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">When the evening had come, a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, came, who also himself was Jesus' disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">He went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">When Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in clean linen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">and laid it in his new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, were sitting there across from the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And on the next day, which was after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered to Pilate,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while He was living, After three days I will rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Then command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say to the people, He has risen from the dead. So the last error will be worse than the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said to them, You have a watch. Go and make [it] as secure as you can.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">And going they made the tomb secure, sealing the stone along with the guard.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But late in the week, at the dawning into the first [day] of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And behold, a great earthquake occurred! For coming down from Heaven, and coming up, an angel of [the] Lord rolled back the stone from the door and [was] sitting on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the keepers shook for fear of him and became like dead [men].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not fear, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here, for He has risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead. And, behold, He goes before you into Galilee. There you shall see Him. Lo, I have told you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they quickly departed from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring His disciples word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But as they were going to report to His disciples, behold, Jesus also met them, saying, Hail! And they came and held Him by the feet and worshiped Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid; go tell My brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and declared all the things that were done to the chief priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And being assembled with the elders, and taking counsel, [they] gave enough silver to the soldiers,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free from care.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And taking the silver, they did as they were taught. And this saying was spread among the Jews until today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">as it is written in the Prophets, Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of [the] Lord, make His paths straight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">John came baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And all the land of Judea, and those of Jerusalem, went out to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a leather girdle about his loin. And he ate locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he proclaimed, saying, There is One coming after me who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down to loosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I indeed have baptized you in water, but He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And there came a voice from Heaven, [saying], You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. And He was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God draws near. Repent, and believe the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And walking along beside the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jesus said to them, Come after Me and I will make you fishers of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And immediately they left their nets and followed Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when He going farther from there a little, He saw James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And immediately He called them. And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and went after Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they went into Capernaum. And immediately on the sabbath day He entered into the synagogue and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they were astonished at His doctrine. For He taught them as one who had authority, and not like the scribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And in their synagogue was a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">saying, What [is] to us and to You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know You, who You are, the Holy One of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the unclean spirit, convulsing him, and crying with a loud voice, he came out of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They all were amazed, so as to question among themselves, saying, What is this? What new doctrine [is] this? For He even commands the unclean spirits with authority, and they obey Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And immediately His fame went out into all the Galilean neighborhood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And immediately after they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and at once they told Him about her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up. And instantly the fever left her, and she served them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And at evening, when the sun set, they brought all those who were diseased to Him, and those who had been demon-possessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And all the city had gathered at the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And He healed many who were sick of different diseases, and cast out many demons. And He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And rising up quite early in [the] night, He went out and went away into a deserted place, and [He] was praying there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Simon, and those with him, searched for Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And finding Him, they said to Him, All are seeking You.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And He said to them, Let us go into the next towns so that I may proclaim there also. For that reason I came forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And He proclaimed in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And a leper came to Him, begging Him and kneeling down to Him, and saying to Him, If You will, You can make me clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Jesus, moved with compassion, put out [His] hand and touched him, and said to him, I will; be clean!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And He having spoken, the leprosy instantly departed from him and he was cleansed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And He strictly charged him and immediately sent him away,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and He said to him, See that you say nothing to anyone. But go and show yourself to the priest, and offer those things which Moses commanded for your cleansing, for a testimony to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But going out, he began to proclaim [it] very much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was outside in deserted places. And they came to Him from every quarter.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And again He entered into Capernaum after [some] days. And it was heard that He was in [a] house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then they came to Him, bringing one [who was] paralyzed, who was carried by four.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When they could not come near to Him because of the crowd, they unroofed the roof where He was. And digging through, they let down the cot on which the paralytic was lying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, Child, your sins are forgiven to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But some of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Why does this one speak such blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God only?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And instantly knowing in His spirit that they reasoned so within themselves, He said to them, Why do you reason these things in your heart?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, [Your] sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and take up your cot and walk?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And as he sowed, it happened that indeed some fell by the wayside, and the fowls of the air came and ate it up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And another fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth. And it sprang up at once, due to not having deepness of earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when [the] sun rose, it was scorched. And because it had no root, it withered away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And another fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And another fell on good ground and yielded fruit, going up and increasing. And one bore thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundredfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And He said to them, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when He was alone, they who were about Him, with the Twelve, asked Him concerning the parable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And He said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God. But to those outside, all [these] things are [given] in parables</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And He said to them, Do you not know this parable? And how then will you know all parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The sower sows the Word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And these are those by the wayside, where the Word is sown. And when they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the Word that was sown in their hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And these are those likewise being sown on stony places; who, when they hear the Word, immediately receive it with gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Afterward when affliction or persecution arises for the Word's sake, they are immediately offended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And these are those being sown among thorns; such as hear the Word,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and the cares of this world, and the deceit of riches, and the lust about other things entering in, choke the Word, and it becomes unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And these are those sown on good ground, who hear the Word and welcome [it], and bear fruit, one thirty, one sixty, and one a hundredfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And He said to them, Does a lamp come to be put under a grain-measure, or under a bed? and not to be set on a lampstand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For there is nothing hidden which shall not be revealed; nor became covered, but that it might come to the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And He said to them, Take heed what you hear. With that measure which you measure, it shall be measured to you. And to you who hear, more shall be given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For he who has, [more] shall be given to him; and he who has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And He said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knows not how.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the earth brings out fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, after that the full grain in the ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But when the fruit has been brought out, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And He said, to what shall we compare the kingdom of God? Or by what parable shall we compare it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">[It is] like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And with many such parables He spoke the Word to them, as they were able to hear [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But he did not speak to them without a parable. And when [they were] alone, He explained all things to His disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And evening having come, He said to them on that day, Let us pass over to the other side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And when they had sent away the crowd, they took Him with them as He was in the boat. And there were also other little boats with Him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">And He was in the stern of the boat, asleep on a headrest. And they awakened Him and said to Him, Master, do You not care that we perish?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And He awakened and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace! Be still! And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And He said to them, Why are you so fearful? How [is it] that you have no faith?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And they came over to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">who had [his] dwelling among the tombs. And no one could bind him, no, not with chains</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">because he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nor could anyone subdue him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying and cutting himself with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshiped Him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and cried with a loud voice, and said, What [is] to me and to You, Jesus, son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God not to torment me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For He said to him, Come out of the man, unclean spirit!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And He asked him, What [is] your name? And he answered, saying, My name [is] Legion, for we are many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he begged Him very much that He would not send them outside the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And a great herd of pigs was feeding near the mountains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And all the demons begged Him, saying, Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And immediately Jesus allowed them. And the unclean spirits went out and entered into the pigs. And the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea (they were about two thousand), and were choked in the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the ones who fed the pigs fled and told [it] in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they came to Jesus and saw him who had been demon-possessed, and had the legion, sitting and clothed and right-minded, the one who had the legion. And they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And those who had seen told them how it happened to the one who had been demon-possessed, and about the pigs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they began to beg Him to leave their borders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when He had come into the boat, the [former] demoniac begged Him that he might be with Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">However Jesus did not allow him, but said to him, Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and has had mercy on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all marvelled.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="47">And when evening had come, the boat was in [the] middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And He saw them toiling in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them. And about the fourth watch of the night He came toward them walking on the sea, and would have passed by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed that it was a phantom, and cried out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">For they all saw Him and were troubled. And immediately He talked with them, and said, Be of good cheer. I AM! Do not be afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And He went up into the boat to them. And the wind was cut off. And they were very much amazed within themselves beyond measure, and marveled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">For they did not understand [the miracle] of the loaves, for their hearts were hardened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And crossing over, they came into the land of Gennesaret and drew to the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And when they had come out of the boat, at once knowing Him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">they ran all around that neighborhood, and began to carry on cots those who were sick, wherever they heard He was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And wherever He entered, into villages or cities or country, they laid the sick in the streets and begged Him if only they might touch but the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made whole.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the Pharisees and some of the scribes came together to Him, having come from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when they saw some of His disciples eating loaves with unclean hands, that is with unwashed hands, they found fault.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they immerse [their] hands with the fist, holding the tradition of the elders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And coming from the market, they do not eat without immersing, and there are many other things which they have received to hold, the dippings of cups and pots, and of copper vessels, and of tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat loaves with unwashed hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But He answered and said to them, Well has Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honors Me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">However, they worship Me in vain, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the dippings of pots and cups. And many other such things you do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And He said to them, Do you do well to set aside the commandment of God, so that you may keep your own tradition?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother. And, Whoever curses father or mother, let him die the death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But you say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban! (that is, A gift [to God], whatever you may profit by me)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and you no longer allow him to do anything toward [his] father or mother,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">making the word of God of no effect through your tradition which you have delivered. And you do many such things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And calling near all the crowd, He said to them, Listen to Me, every one of you, and understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">There is nothing from outside a man which entering into him can defile [him]. But the things which come out of him, those are the ones that defile the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when He had entered into the house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him concerning the parable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And He said to them, Are you also without understanding? Do you not perceive that whatever enters into the man from outside cannot defile him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">because it does not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the waste-bowl, purifying all food?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And He said, That which comes out of the man is what defiles the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All these evil things pass out from inside and defile the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And He arose from there and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And He entered into a house and desired no one to know [it]. But He could not be hidden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For a woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of Him and came and fell at His feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by race. And she begged Him that He would cast the demon out of her daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be filled. For it is not right to take the children's loaves and to throw [it] to the dogs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And she answered and said to Him, Yes, Lord, yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And He said to her, For this saying go, the demon has gone out of your daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when she had come to her house, she found the demon had gone out, and her daughter lay on the couch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, He came to the Sea of Galilee, in the midst of the borders of the Decapolis.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they brought a deaf one to Him, hardly speaking. And they begged Him to put [His] hand on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And He took him aside from the crowd and put His fingers into his ears. And He spat and touched his tongue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And looking up to Heaven, He sighed and said to him, Ephphatha! (that is, Be opened!)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And instantly his ears were opened and the bond of his tongue was loosened, and he spoke plainly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And He commanded them, that they should tell no one. But the more He commanded them, so much the more they proclaimed [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days, the crowd being very great and having nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples and said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I have compassion on the crowd because they have now been with Me three days and have nothing to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint in the way. For many of them come from afar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And His disciples answered Him, From where can a man satisfy these [with] loaves here in the wilderness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And He asked them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And He commanded the people to recline on the ground. And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks, and He broke and gave to His disciples to set before them. And they set [them before] the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they had a few fish. And He blessed and commanded them to also serve these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So they ate and were filled. And [they] took up over and above seven lunch baskets [of] fragments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they who had eaten were about four thousand. And He sent them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And immediately He entered into a boat with His disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with Him, seeking a sign from Heaven from Him, tempting Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And He sighed deeply in His spirit and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, [There shall no] sign be given to this generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And He left them. And entering into the boat again, He departed to the other side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And [the disciples] had forgotten to take loaves, and they did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And He charged them, saying, Take heed! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and [of] the leaven of Herod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no loaves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And knowing [it], Jesus said to them, Why do you reason [that it is] because you have no loaves? Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Have you still hardened your heart?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Do you have eyes and do not see? Do you have ears and do not hear? And do you not remember?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many hand baskets full of fragments did you take up? They said to Him, Twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the seven among four thousand, how many lunch baskets full of fragments did you take up? And they said, Seven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And He said to them, How do you not understand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And He came to Bethsaida. And they brought a blind man to Him and begged Him to touch him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when He had spat on his eyes and had put [His] hands on him, He asked Him if he saw anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he looked up and said, I see men as trees, walking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And after that He put [His] hands again on his eyes and made him look up. And he was restored and saw all clearly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And He sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Jesus and His disciples went out into the towns of Caesarea Philippi. And in the way He asked His disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they answered, John the Baptist. But others [say] Elijah, and others say one of the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And He said to them, But who do you say that I am? And Peter answered and said to Him, You are the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And He charged them that they should tell no one of Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And He began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And He spoke that saying openly. And Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But when He had turned around and looked on His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Go behind Me, Satan! For you do not mind the things of God, but of the things of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And calling near the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, Whoever will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For whoever will save his life shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for My sake and the gospel's, he shall save it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Or what shall a man give in exchange [for] his soul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Therefore whoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man shall also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And after six days Jesus took Peter and James and John and led them up into a high mountain, apart by themselves. And He was transfigured before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And His clothing became shining, exceedingly white as snow such as no fuller on earth could whiten them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Elijah with Moses was seen by them, and they were talking with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good [for] us to be here. And let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For he did not know what to say, for they were very much afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there was a cloud that overshadowed them. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son. Hear Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And suddenly, looking around, they did not see anyone any more, except Jesus alone with themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And as they came down from the mountain, He commanded them that they should tell no one the things that they had seen until the Son of man had risen from [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they kept that saying within themselves, debating with one another what the rising from [the] dead [is].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they asked Him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must first come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And He answered and told them, Elijah truly does come first and restores all things. And how has it been written of the Son of man that He should suffer many things and be despised?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they desired, as it is written of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And coming to [His] disciples, He saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And immediately all the crowd, seeing Him, were greatly amazed, and they were running to [Him] to greet Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And He asked the scribes, What are you discussing with them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And one of the crowd answered and said, Teacher, I have brought my son who has a dumb spirit to You.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And wherever he seizes him, he dashes him. And he foams and gnashes his teeth and pines away. And I spoke to Your disciples that they should cast him out, and they could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He answered him and said, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they brought him to Him. And when he saw Him, the spirit immediately convulsed him. And he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And He asked his father, How long ago has it been since this came to him? And he said, From childhood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And oftentimes it has cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to him, If you can believe, all things [are] possible to him who believes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, Lord, I believe. Help my unbelief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And seeing that a crowd is running together, Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and enter no more into him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And [the spirit] cried out, throwing him into convulsions, and came out of him. And he was like one dead, so that many said, He is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And He entering into a house, His disciples asked Him privately, [Why] could we not cast him out?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And He said to them, This kind can come out by nothing except by prayer and fasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And going out from there, they passed through Galilee. And He desired that no one should know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For He taught His disciples and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into [the] hands of men, and they shall kill him. And after He is killed, He shall rise the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But they did not understand that saying and were afraid to ask Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And He came to Capernaum. And being in the house, He asked them, What was it that you disputed among yourselves in the way?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out demons in Your name, and he does not follow us. And we forbade him, because he does not follow us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But Jesus said, Do not forbid him. For there is no one who shall do a work of power in My name who can lightly speak evil of Me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">Give, and it shall be given to you, good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over, they shall give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you measure, it shall be measured to you again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And He spoke a parable to them: Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">The disciple is not above his master, but everyone who is perfect shall be like his master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And why do you look at the splinter that is in your brother's eye, but do not see the beam that is in [your] own eye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me pull out the splinter in your eye, when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First cast out the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to pull out the splinter that is in your brother's eye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">For a good tree does not bring forth corrupt fruit, neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For every tree is known by [its] own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth the good. And an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth the evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="47">Whoever comes to Me and hears My words, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He is like a man who built a house and dug deep and laid the foundation on a rock; and a flood occurring, the stream burst against that house and could not shake it; for it was founded on a rock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But he who hears and does not perform, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, on which the stream burst, and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when He had ended all His words in the ears of the people, He entered into Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And a certain servant of a centurion who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when he heard of Jesus, he sent the elders of the Jews to Him, begging Him that He would come and heal his servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And coming to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that he was worthy, he for whom You give this;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for, [they said], He loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Jesus went with them. But He being yet not far off from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble Yourself. For I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore neither did I think myself worthy to come to You; but say a word, and my servant will be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And hearing these things, Jesus marveled at him. And turning to the crowd following Him, He said, I say to you, I have not found such faith, no, not in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they who were sent, returning to the house, found the sick servant well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it happened on the next day, He went into a city called Nain. And many of His disciples and a great crowd went with Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And drawing near the gate of the city, even behold, one having died was being carried out, an only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a considerable crowd of the city was with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, Do not weep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And He came and touched the bier. And the ones who bore [him] stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, Arise!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the one who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He delivered him to his mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And fear came on all. And they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has risen up among us; and, God has visited His people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this report of Him went out in all Judea, and in all the neighborhood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And his disciples reported all these things to John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And John, calling near a certain two of his disciples, sent [them] to Jesus, saying, Are You He that should come, or do we look for another?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And coming to Him, the men said, John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, Are You He who should come, or do we look for another?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And in the same hour He cured many of infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits. And He gave sight to many who were blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And answering, Jesus said to them, Go and tell John what you have seen and heard; that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the gospel is proclaimed to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And blessed is [he] who shall not be offended in Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the people concerning John. What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But what did you go out to see? A man clothed with soft clothing? Behold, those in splendid clothing and being in luxury are in kings' palaces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This is [he] of whom it is written, Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For I say to you, Among [those] who are born of woman there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist. But he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And all the people and the tax-collectors who heard [Him] justified God, being baptized [with] the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, not being baptized by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the Lord said, To what then shall I compare the men of this generation? And to what are they like?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They are like children sitting in a market and calling to one another, and saying, We have played the flute to you, and you have not danced; we have mourned to you, and you did not weep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of tax-collectors and sinners!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But wisdom has been justified by all her children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And going into the Pharisee's house, He reclined.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And behold, a woman, a sinner in the city, knowing that He reclined in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster vial of ointment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And she stood behind [Him], weeping at His feet, and she began to wash His feet with tears and wipe them with the hair of her head. And [she] ardently kissed His feet and anointed [them] with the ointment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But seeing this, the Pharisee who had invited Him, spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what kind of woman [this is] who touches him, for she is a sinner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And answering, Jesus said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Teacher, speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and [the] other fifty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they having nothing to pay, he freely forgave both. Then which of them do [you] say will love him most?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And answering, Simon said, I suppose that one to whom he forgave most. And He said to him, You have judged rightly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And He turned to the woman and said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, yet you gave Me no water for My feet. But she has washed My feet with tears, and has wiped [them] with the hair of her head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">You gave Me no kiss, but this woman, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss My feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with ointment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Therefore I say to you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, he loves little.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And those reclining with [Him] began to say within themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you, go in peace.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it happened afterwards, He traveled in every city and village, proclaiming and announcing the gospel of the kingdom of God. And the Twelve [were] with Him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and also certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities; Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to Him of their possessions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And a great crowd coming together, and those in each city coming to Him, He spoke by a parable:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, the one fell by the roadside and was trampled; and the birds of the air devoured it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And other fell on a rock, and sprouting, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And other fell amidst thorns, and springing up with the thorns, [they] choked it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And other fell on good ground and sprang up, and bore fruit a hundredfold. And when He had said these things, He cried, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And His disciples asked Him, saying, What might this parable be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And He said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God. But to others I speak in parables, so that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Those by the roadside are the ones who hear; then the Devil comes and takes the Word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Those on the rock [are] the ones who, when they hear, receive the Word with joy. And these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And those which fell among thorns are the ones who, when they have heard, go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of life, and do not bear to maturity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But those on the good ground are the ones who, in an honest and good heart, having heard the Word, keep [it] and bring forth fruit with patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And no one lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts [it] under a couch; but he sets [it] on a lampstand so that those who enter in may see the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For nothing is secret that shall not be revealed; nor secret which shall not be known and come to be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore be careful how you hear. For whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And His mother and [His] brothers came to Him. And they could not come near Him because of the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it was told to Him [by some], who said, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside desiring to see You.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And He answered and said to them, My mother and My brothers are those who hear the Word of God and do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And it happened on a certain day that He went into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they put out to sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But as they sailed, He fell asleep. And a storm of wind came onto the lake. And they were being filled [with water] and were in jeopardy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they came to Him and awakened Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! Then being aroused, He rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And He said to them, Where is your faith? And being afraid, they marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this One? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they sailed down to the country of the Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And He going out onto land, He met a certain man out of the city, who had had demons a long time, and put on no clothes, nor stayed in a house, but among the tombs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him and said with a loud voice, What is to me and to You, Jesus, Son of God the Most High? I beseech You, Do not torment me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">(For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had seized him. And he had been kept bound in chains and in fetters, and he broke the bands and was driven into the deserted [places] by the demons.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion; because many demons had entered into him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain. And they begged Him that He would allow them to enter into them. And He allowed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And coming out of the man, the demons entered into the pigs. And the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And those feeding [the pigs], and seeing the thing, fled. And leaving, [they] reported to the city and to the farms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they went out to see what had been done. And they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had departed sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Also those who saw [it] told them how the demon-possessed one was healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And all the multitude of the neighborhood of the Gadarenes were seized with a great fear, and asked Him to depart from them. And entering into the boat, He returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the man out of whom the demons had gone out begged Him, [desiring] to be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Return to your own house and declare what God has done to you. And he went his way and proclaimed throughout all the city what [great] things Jesus had done to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And it happened when Jesus had returned, the people received Him. For they were all waiting for Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And behold, a man named Jairus came, and he was a synagogue-ruler. And he fell down at Jesus' feet and begged Him that He would come into his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as He went, the people thronged Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And a woman who had a flow of blood twelve years (who had spent all her living on physicians, [and] could not be healed by any)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">came behind [Him] and touched the border of His garment. And instantly her flow of blood was staunched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And Jesus said, Who touched Me? And all having denied, Peter and those with Him said, Master, the crowd presses and jostles You, and You say, Who touched Me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Jesus said, Someone has touched Me, for I know that power has gone out of Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And seeing that she was not hidden, the woman came trembling. And falling down before Him, she declared to Him before all the people why she had touched Him, and how she was instantly healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And He said to her, Daughter, be comforted. Your faith has saved you; go in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">He was still speaking when someone came from the synagogue-ruler, saying to him, Your daughter is dead, do not trouble the Teacher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But when Jesus heard, He answered Him, saying, Do not fear, only believe and she shall be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And coming into the house, He allowed no one to go in, except Peter and James and John, and the father and the mother of the girl.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And all were weeping and bewailing her. But He said, Do not weep; she has not died, but sleeps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And they ridiculed, knowing that she was dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And He put them all out. And He took her by the hand and called, saying, Little girl, arise!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And her spirit came again, and she arose immediately. And He commanded that [food] be given her to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And her parents were astonished. But He charged them to tell no one the thing that happened.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And [He] sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And He said to them, Take nothing for [your] journey, neither staffs, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money, nor each to have two tunics.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And whatever house you enter into, abide there and depart from there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they departed and went through the towns, proclaiming the gospel and healing everywhere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things happening by Him. And he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from [the] dead;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets had risen again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Herod said, John I have beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And returning, the apostles told Him all that they had done. And He took them and went aside privately into a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But knowing [this], the crowds followed Him. And He received them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and He healed those who had need of healing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the day began to wear away, and coming up the Twelve said to Him, Send the crowd away so that they may go into the villages and farms all around, and lodge, and get food. For we are here in a deserted place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But He said to them, You give them [something] to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">(For they were about five thousand men.) And He said to His disciples, Make them recline by fifties in a company.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they did so, and made them all recline.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And He took the five loaves and the two fish. And looking up to Heaven, He blessed them and broke, and He gave to the disciples to set before the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they ate and were all filled. And there was taken up twelve hand baskets full of fragments of that left over to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And it happened [as] He was alone praying, the disciples were with Him. And He asked them, saying, Whom do the crowds say that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Answering, they said, John the Baptist; but some [say], Elijah, and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Answering, Peter said, The Christ of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And He strictly charged them and commanded to tell no one this,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">saying, The Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And He said to all, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For whoever will save his life shall lose it, but whoever will lose his life for My sake, he shall save it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world and loses himself, or is cast away?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For whoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words, the Son of man shall be ashamed of him when He shall come in His own and [in His] Father's glory, and that of the holy angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who shall not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And about eight days after these sayings, He took Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And as He prayed, the appearance of His countenance was altered, and His clothing [was] dazzling white.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And behold, two men talked with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">who appeared in glory and spoke of His exodus, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep. But fully awakening, they saw His glory, and the two men who stood with Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And in their parting from Him, it happened that Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for [us] to be here. And let us make three tabernacles, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah; not knowing what he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And as he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them. And they feared [as] they entered into the cloud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, hear Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And when the voice occurred, Jesus was found alone. And they were silent, and told no one in those days anything which they had seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And it happened on the next day, they coming down from the mountain, a huge crowd met Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And behold, a man cried aloud from the crowd, saying, Teacher, I beseech You, look on my son, for he is my only-born son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And lo, a spirit takes him, and [he] suddenly cries out. And [it] throws him into convulsions, with foaming, and with pain departs from him, bruising him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And I begged Your disciples to cast him out, and they could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And answering, Jesus said, O unbelieving generation, [one] having been perverted, how long shall I be with you and endure you? Bring your son here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And as [he] was still coming, the demon violently convulsed and tore [him]. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But as all were marveling at all things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Let these words sink down into your ears. For the Son of man shall be betrayed into [the] hands of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But they did not understand this, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it. And they feared to ask Him of this word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And an argument came in among them, who might be [the] greater of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And seeing the argument of their heart, Jesus took a child and set him beside Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And He said to them, Whoever shall receive this child in My name receives Me. And whoever shall receive Me receives Him who sent Me. For he who is least among you all, he shall be great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in Your name. And we prevented him, because he does not follow us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus said to him, Do not prevent [him], for he who is not against us is for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And it happened in the fulfilling [of] the days of His taking up, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And [He] sent messengers before His face. And they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And they did not receive Him, because His face was going toward Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And seeing, His disciples James and John said, Lord, do You desire [that] we command fire to come down from Heaven and consume them, even as Elijah did?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">For it is easier [for] a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich one to enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the ones who heard said, And who can be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And He said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Peter said, Lo, we have left all and have followed You.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And He said to them, Truly I say to you, There is no one who has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children for the sake of the kingdom of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and, in the world to come everlasting life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And He took the Twelve and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man will be accomplished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For He will be delivered to the nations and will be mocked and insulted and spat on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they will scourge [Him] and put Him to death, and the third day He will rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they did not understand any of these things. And this saying was hidden from them, nor did they know the things which were spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And as He came near Jericho, it happened that a certain blind man sat by the roadside begging.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And hearing the crowd pass by, he asked what it meant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passed by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he cried, saying, Jesus, Son of David! Have mercy on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they who were in front rebuked him that he should be quiet. But he cried so much the more, Son of David! Have mercy on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He asked him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">saying, What do you desire that I should do to you? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight! Your faith has saved you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And when they saw, all the people gave praise to God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And going in, He passed through Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And behold, [there was] a man named Zaccheus, who was a chief tax-collector. And he was rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he sought to see Jesus, to see who He was. And he could not because of the press, because he was little in stature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he ran in front and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him. For He was to pass through that [way].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him. And He said to him, Zaccheus! Hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And hurrying he came down, and received Him joyfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And seeing, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to stay with a sinful man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor. And [in] anything I accused anyone falsely, I restore [it] fourfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jesus said to him, This day salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as they heard these things, He added and spoke a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was about to appear immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore He said, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive a kingdom for himself, and to return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And He called his ten servants and delivered ten minas, and said to them, Trade until I come back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But his citizens hated him. And they sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this one to reign over us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when he had received his kingdom and had returned, then it happened that he commanded these servants to be called to him; the ones to whom he had given the silver; so that he might know what each had gained by trading.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And came the first, saying, Lord, your mina has gained ten minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to him, Well [done], good servant, because you have been faithful in a least thing, have authority over ten cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the second came, saying, Lord, your mina has made five minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said the same to him, You be over five cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And another came, saying, Lord, behold, [here is] your mina, which I have kept in a handkerchief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For I feared you, because you are a harsh man. You take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said to him, I will judge you out of your own mouth, wicked servant! You knew that I was a harsh man, taking up what I had not laid down and reaping what I did not sow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And why did you not give my silver on the [bank] table, and coming I might have exacted it with interest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him and give [it] to him who has ten minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For I say to you that to everyone who has, more will be given. And from him who has not, even that which he has will be taken from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But those who are my enemies, who did not desire that I should reign over them, bring them here and slay [them] before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And saying these things, He went in front, going up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it happened as He drew near Bethphage and Bethany, toward the mount called Mount of Olives, He sent two of the disciples,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">And if anyone asks you, Why are you untying [it]? You will say this to him, Because the Lord has need of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And going, those who were sent found as He had said to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And [as] they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, Why are you untying the colt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they said, The Lord has need of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they brought him to Jesus. And they threw their garments on the colt. And they set Jesus on [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as He went, they spread their clothes in the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And when He had come near, even now at the descent of the Mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all [the] mighty works which they had seen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">saying, Blessed [is] the King coming in the name of the Lord! Peace in Heaven and glory in [the] highest!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And He answered and said to them, I tell you that if these should be silent, the stones would cry out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And as He drew near, He beheld the city and wept over it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">saying, If you had known, even you, even at least in this day of yours, the things for your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">For the days will come on you that your enemies will raise up a rampart to you, and will surround you, and will keep you in on every side.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">And entering into the temple, He began to cast out those selling and buying in it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">saying to them, It is written, My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And He taught in the temple daily. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy Him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And on one of those days, as He taught the people in the temple and proclaimed the gospel, it happened that the chief priests and the scribes along with the elders came on [Him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they spoke to Him, saying, Tell us, by what authority do you do these things? Or who is he who gave you this authority?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And He answered and said to them, I will also ask you one thing, and you answer me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The baptism of John, was it from Heaven or from men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they reasoned within themselves, saying, If we shall say, From Heaven, he will say, Why then did you not believe him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if we say, From men, then all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they answered that they could not tell from where [it was].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And He began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard and let it out to vinedressers. And [he] went into a far country for a long time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And in season he sent a servant to the vinedressers, so that they should give him the fruit of the vineyard. But the vinedressers beat him and sent [him] away empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And again he sent another servant. And they also beat him and treated [him] shamefully, and sent [him] away empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And again he sent a third. And they also wounded him and cast [him] out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that they will respect [him] when they see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir! Come, let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed [him]. What then shall the lord of the vineyard do to them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He shall come and destroy these vinedressers and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard this, they said, Let it not be!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And He looked at them and said, What then is this which is written,  The] Stone which the builders rejected, the same has become [the] Head of [the] corner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whoever shall fall on that Stone shall be broken, but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him the same hour. And [they] feared the people, for they perceived that He had spoken this parable against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they watched and sent forth spies, pretending themselves to be righteous men, so that they might seize upon a word of His, that they might deliver Him in this way to the power and authority of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked Him, saying, Teacher, we know that you say and teach rightly, and do not accept the person of anyone, but truly teach the way of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar or not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But He perceived their craftiness and said to them, Why do you tempt Me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Show Me a coin. Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered and said, Caesar's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And He said to them, Therefore render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they could not take hold of His words before the people. And they marveled at His answer and were silent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And certain of the Sadducees came, those speaking against a resurrection, [that it was] not to be. And they asked Him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If anyone's brother dies, having a wife, and if he dies without children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife and died without children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the second took her as a wife, and he died childless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the third took her. And likewise the seven left no children and died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Last of all the woman also died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be? For the seven had her [as] a wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And answering, Jesus said to them, The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">but they who shall be counted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from [the] dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Nor can they die [any] more, for they are equal to the angels, and are the sons of God, being the sons of the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But that the dead are raised, even Moses pointed out at the Bush, when he called [the] Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For He is not God of [the] dead, but of the living. For all live to Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And answering, certain of the scribes said, Teacher, you have spoken well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And after that they did not dare ask Him anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And He said to them, How do they say that Christ is the Son of David?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Even David himself says in [the] Book of Psalms, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">until I place Your enemies as Your footstool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">David then calls Him Lord; how then is He his son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And as all the people were listening, He said to the disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at the feasts;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">who devour widows' houses, and make long prayers for a show; the same shall receive a more severe condemnation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="43">And an angel appeared to Him from Heaven, strengthening Him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">This one came as a witness, to bear witness concerning the Light, so that all might believe through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He was not that Light, but [was sent] to bear witness of that Light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He was the true Light; [He] enlightens every man coming into the world.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, I am not the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then they said to him, Who are you so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say of yourself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, I [am] the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they who were sent were from the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they asked him and said, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor that Prophet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but One stands among you whom you do not know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He it is who, coming after me, who has been before me; of whom I am not worthy to loosen the thong of His sandal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The next day John sees Jesus coming to him and says, Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water, that One said to me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon Him, He is the One who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">He says to them, Come and see. They came and saw where He lived, and stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">One of the two who heard John and followed Him was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He first found [his] own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being translated, the Christ).</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="43">The day after, Jesus desired to go forth into Galilee. And He found Philip and said to him, Follow Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses wrote in the law and the prophets, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Nathanael said to him, Can there be any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael said to Him, From where do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael answered and said to Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater [things] than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see Heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And He said to them, Now draw out and carry it to the master of the feast. And they carried [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water which was made wine (and did not know where it was from, but the servants who drew the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And [he] said to him, Every man at the beginning sets forth good wine, and when men have drunk well, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This beginning of miracles Jesus did in Cana of Galilee. And [it] revealed His glory. And His disciples believed on Him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when He had made a scourge of small cords, He drove them all out of the temple, also the sheep and the oxen. And He poured out the money-changers' money and overthrew the tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And He said to those who sold doves, Take these things away from here. Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of Your house has eaten Me up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the Jews answered and said to Him, What sign do you show us, since you do these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then the Jews said, This temple was forty-six years building, and will you rear it up in three days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But He spoke of the temple of His body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, at the feast, many believed in His name when they saw the miracles which He did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and did not need that anyone should testify of man. For He knew what was in man.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He came to Jesus by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no [man] can do these miracles which you do unless God is with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second [time] into his mother's womb and be born?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He who believes on Him is not condemned, but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the condemnation, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the Light, because their deeds were evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light, lest his deeds should be exposed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore when the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give Me to drink, you would have asked of Him, and He would have given you living water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The woman said to Him, Sir, you have no vessel, and the well is deep. From where then do you have that living water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children and his cattle?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you shall neither worship the Father in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You worship what you do not know, we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to worship Him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="52">Then he asked of them the hour when he began to get better. And they said to him, Yesterday [at the] seventh hour the fever left him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now there is a pool at the Sheep Gate at Jerusalem, which [is] called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, of blind, lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and troubled the water. Then whoever first stepped in after the troubling of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty-eight years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus saw him lying, and knowing that he had spent much time, He said to him, Do you desire to be made whole?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The infirm man answered Him, Sir, when the water is troubled, I have no one to put me into the pool. But while I am coming, another steps down before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus says to him, Rise, take up your bed and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked. And it was a sabbath on that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore the Jews said to him who had been healed, It is the sabbath. It is not lawful for you to take up the bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, He who made me whole said to me, Take up your bed and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he did not know Him who had cured him, for Jesus had moved away, a crowd being in the place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you are made whole. Sin no more lest a worse thing come to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then, because of this, the Jews sought the more to kill Him, because He not only had broken the sabbath, but also said that God was His father, making Himself equal with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself but what He sees the Father do. For whatever things He does, these also the Son does likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all the things that He Himself does. And He will show Him greater works than these, so that you may marvel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For as the Father raises the dead and makes alive, even so the Son of man makes alive whomever He wills.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">so that all should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes on Him who sent Me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation, but has passed from death to life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they who hear shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has given to the Son to have life within Himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is [the] Son of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Do not marvel at this, for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves shall hear His voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and shall come forth, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have practiced evil to the resurrection of condemnation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I can do nothing of My own self. As I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of [the] Father who has sent Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">There is another who bears witness of Me, and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">And He sending Me, the Father Himself, has borne witness of Me. Neither have you heard His voice at any time nor seen His shape.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather up the fragments left over, so that nothing is lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore they gathered and filled twelve handbaskets with fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over to those who had eaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then seeing the miracle that Jesus did, those men said, This is truly the Prophet, the [One] coming into the world.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">But I said to you that you also have seen Me and do not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and the [one] who comes to Me I will in no way cast out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For I came down from Heaven, not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">Then the Jews murmured about Him, because He said, I am the bread which came down from Heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they said, Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How now does this One say, I have come down from Heaven?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Do not murmur with one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">No one can come to Me unless the Father who has sent Me draw him, and I will raise him up at the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Therefore everyone who hears and learns from the Father comes to Me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="51">I am the Living Bread which came down from Heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread, he shall live forever. And truly the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then the Jews argued with one another, saying, How can this man give us [his] flesh to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Then Jesus says to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Whoever partakes of My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="59">He said these things in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Then when they had heard, many of His disciples said, This is a hard saying, who can hear it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">But knowing in Himself that His disciples murmured about it, Jesus said to them, Does this offend you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Then [what] if you should see the Son of man going up where He was before?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">It is the Spirit that makes alive, the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit and are life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from [the] beginning who they were who did not believe, and who is the one] betraying Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And He said, Because of this I said to you that no one can come to Me unless it was given to him from My Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">From this [time] many of His disciples went back into the things behind, and walked no more with Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then Jesus said to the Twelve, Do you also wish to go away?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have [the] words of eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">And we have believed and have known that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? And one [of] you is a devil?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for He did not desire to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore His brothers said to Him, Move away from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see the works that You do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For no one does anything in secret, while he himself seeks to be in public. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For His brothers did not believe in Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Jesus said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it, that its works are evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You go up to this feast; I am not yet going up to this feast; for My time is not yet fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as in secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the Jews sought Him at the feast and said, Where is He?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And there was much murmuring among the crowd concerning Him, for some said, He is a good man; others said, No, but he deceives the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">However, no one spoke openly of Him, because of the fear of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now about the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the Jews marveled, saying, How does this man know letters, not being taught?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If anyone desires to do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it is of God, or I speak from Myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He who speaks of himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Did not Moses give you the law? And [yet] not one of you keeps the law! Why do you seek to kill Me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The crowd answered and said, You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Because of this Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers,) and you circumcise a man on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath day so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry at Me because I have made a man entirely sound on the sabbath day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Do not judge according to sight, but judge righteous judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then some of those from Jerusalem said, Is this not the one they seek to kill?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But lo, he speaks publicly, and they say nothing to him. Perhaps the rulers truly know that this is the Christ indeed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">However, we know this one, from where he is; but when Christ comes, no one knows from where He is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Jesus cried in the temple as He taught, saying, You both know Me, and you know from where I come. And I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He has sent Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then they sought to seize Him, but no one laid [a] hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And many of the crowd believed on Him, and said, When the Christ comes, will He do more miracles than these which this One has done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The Pharisees heard that the crowd murmured such things concerning Him. And the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to seize Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while I am with you, and [then] I go to Him who sent Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You shall seek Me and shall not find [Me]. And where I am, you cannot come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then the Jews said among themselves, Where is he about to go that we shall not find him? Is he about to go to the Dispersion of the Greeks, and to teach the Greeks?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">What saying is this that He said, You shall seek Me and shall not find [Me], and where I am, you cannot come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And in the last day of the great feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He who believes on Me, as the Scripture has said, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">(But He spoke this about the Spirit, which they who believed on Him should receive; for [the] Holy Spirit was not yet [given], because Jesus was not yet glorified.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then when they heard the Word, many of the people said, Truly this is the Prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Others said, This is the Christ. But others said, Does the Christ come out of Galilee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Has the Scripture not said that Christ comes from the seed of David and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">So a division occurred in the crowd because of Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And some of them desired to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, Why have you not brought him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">The officers answered, Never did any man speak as does this Man.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman taken in adultery. And standing her in the midst,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">they said to Him, Teacher, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned. You, then, what do you say?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They said this, tempting Him so that they might have [reason] to accuse Him. But bending down, Jesus wrote on the ground with [His] finger, not appearing [to hear].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But as they continued to ask Him, He lifted Himself up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And again bending down, He wrote on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And hearing, and being convicted by conscience, they went out one by one, beginning at the oldest, until the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And she said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I give judgment. Go, and sin no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying, I am the Light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore the Pharisees said to Him, You bear record concerning yourself; your witness is not true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear record concerning Myself, My witness is true. For I know from where I came, and where I go. But you do not know from where I came, and where I go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You judge after the flesh, I judge no one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And yet if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and [the] Father who sent Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I am one who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness concerning Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then they said to Him, Where is your father? Jesus said to them, You neither know Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as He taught in the temple. And no man laid hands upon Him, for His hour had not yet come.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the Jews said, Will he kill himself? Because he says, Where I go you cannot come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And He said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore I said to you that you shall die in your sins, for if you do not believe that I AM, you shall die in your sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then they said to Him, Who are you? And Jesus said to them, Even [the same] which I also say to you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="44">You are of the Devil as father, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from [the] beginning, and did not abide in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own, for he is a liar and the father of it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him. For they know his voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they did not understand what it was which He spoke to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Jesus said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I am the door. If anyone enters in by Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The thief does not come except to steal and to kill and to destroy. I have come so that they might have life, and that they might have [it] more abundantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But he who is a hireling and not the shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away. And the wolf catches them and scatters the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The hireling flees, because he is a hireling and does not care for the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am the Good Shepherd, and I know those that [are] Mine, and I am known by those who are Mine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Even as the Father knows Me, I also know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I have other sheep who are not of this fold. I must also lead those, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I might take it again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down from Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. I have received this commandment from My Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then a division occurred again among the Jews because of these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And many of them said, He has a demon and is insane. Why do you hear him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Others said, These are not words of one who has been possessed by a demon. A demon is not able to open [the] eyes of blind ones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And [the Feast] of Dedication took place at Jerusalem, and it was winter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's Porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then the Jews encircled Him and said to Him, How long do you make us doubt? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus answered them, I told you and you did not believe. The works that I do in My Father's name, they bear witness of Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But you did not believe because you are not of My sheep. As I said to you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And I give to them eternal life, and they shall never ever perish, and not anyone shall pluck them out of My hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">My Father who gave [them] to me is greater than all, and no one is able to pluck [them] out of My Father's hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I and the Father are one!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from My Father; for which of these do you stone Me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The Jews answered Him, saying, We do not stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">If He called those gods with whom the Word of God was, and the Scripture cannot be broken,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">do you say [of Him] whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You blaspheme, because I said, I am the Son of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works so that you may know and believe that the Father [is] in Me, and I in Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then they again sought to seize Him, but He went forth out of their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And He went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John baptized at the first, and He stayed there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And many came to Him and said, John indeed did no miracle, but all things that John said concerning this One were true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And many believed on Him there.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And there was a certain sick one, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(And it was [that] Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then his sisters sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When Jesus heard, He said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God might be glorified by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore, when He had heard that he was sick, then indeed He remained two days in the place where He was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then after that He said to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, the Jews lately have sought to stone You, and do You go there again?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles because there is no light in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He said these things; and after that He said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps. But I go so that I may awaken him out of sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then His disciples said, Lord, if he sleeps, he will get well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He had spoken of taking rest in sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, in order that you may believe. But let us go to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Thomas (he being called Twin) said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then when Jesus came, He found him already being held in the tomb four days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Bethany was near Jerusalem, fifteen stadia away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary in order to comfort them concerning their brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she met Him. But Mary was sitting in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But I know that even now, whatever You will ask of God, God will give You.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Martha said to Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said to her, I am the Resurrection and the Life! He who believes in Me, though he die, yet he shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">She said to Him, Yes, Lord, I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who has come into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And saying these things, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher has come and calls you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As soon as she heard, she arose quickly and came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out, [they] followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then when Mary had come where Jesus was, seeing Him, Mary fell down at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then when He saw her weeping, and also the Jews who came with her weeping, Jesus groaned in the spirit and troubled Himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And [He] said, Where have you laid him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then the Jews said, Behold how He loved him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And some of them said, Was not this Man who opened the eyes of the blind able also to cause that even this one should not have died?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then Jesus, groaning in Himself again, came to the tomb. And it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who died, said to Him, Lord, by this time he stinks. For it is [the] fourth [day].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus answered her, Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then they took away the stone where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up [His] eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And I know that You hear Me always, but because of the people who stand by I said [it], so that they may believe that You have sent Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And saying these things, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, Here! Outside!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he who had died came out, bound hand and foot with sheets, and his face was bound with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Untie him and let [him] go!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Then the chief priests and Pharisees gathered a sanhedrin, and said, What can we do? For this man does many miracles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">If we let him alone this way, all will believe on him. And the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And one of them, Caiaphas, being the high priest of that year, said to them, You do not know anything at all,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="51">And he did not speak this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and not for that nation only, but also that He should gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Then from that day they took counsel together that they might kill Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Therefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but He went away from there to a country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and continued there with His disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And the Jews' Passover was near. And many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover in order to purify themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Then they sought Jesus, and spoke with one another as they stood in the temple, What does it seem to you, that He will not at all come to the feast?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And all the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commands, that if anyone knew where He was, he should make [it] known so that they might seize Him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was (who had died, whom He raised from [the] dead).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then they made a supper there for Him. And Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those reclining with Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Mary took a pound of ointment of pure spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said one of His disciples (Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], who was to betray Him)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Why was this ointment not sold [for] three hundred denarii and given to [the] poor?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and held the moneybag and carried the things put [in].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Jesus said, Let her alone. She has kept this for the day of My burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For you have the poor with you always; but you do not always have Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then a great crowd of the Jews learned that He was there. And they did not come for Jesus' sake only, but also that they might see Lazarus, whom He had raised from [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus to death also,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">because many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus because of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">On the next day, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, a great crowd who had come to the Feast</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him. And [they] cried, Hosanna! Blessed [is] the King of Israel who comes in [the] name of [the] Lord!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And finding an ass colt, Jesus sat on it; as it is written,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King comes sitting on the foal of an ass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But His disciples did not know these things at the first. But when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and [that] they had done these things to Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then the crowd witnessed, those who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Because of this the crowd also met Him, because they heard that He had done this miracle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the Pharisees said among themselves, Do you see how you gain nothing? Behold, the world has gone after Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the Feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Philip came and told Andrew. And again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He who loves his life shall lose it. And he who hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant shall be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour? But for this cause I came to this hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Father, glorify Your name! Then there came a voice from the heaven [saying], I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then the crowd who stood by and heard said that it thundered. Others said, An angel spoke to Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus answered and said, This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Now is [the] judgment of this world. Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to Myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But He said this, signifying what kind [of] death He was about to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The crowd answered Him, We have heard out of the law that Christ lives forever. How do you say, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while the Light is with you. Walk while you have the Light, lest darkness come upon you. For he who walks in darkness does not know where he goes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">While you have the Light, believe in the Light so that you may become sons of Light. Jesus spoke these things and departed and was hidden from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But [though] He had done so many miracles before them, yet they did not believe on Him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">so that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, so that they should not see with [their] eyes nor understand with [their] heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Isaiah said these things when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Still, however, even out of the rulers, many did believe on Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not confess, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But Jesus cried out and said, He who believes on Me does not believe on Me but on Him who sent Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">I have come [as] a Light into the world, so that whoever believes on Me should not remain in darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And if any one hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him, for I do not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He who rejects Me and does not receive My words has one who judges him; the Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">For I have not spoken of Myself, but [the] Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say, and what I should speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And I know that His command is life everlasting. Therefore whatever I speak, even as the Father said to Me, so I speak.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come when He should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved [His] own in the world, He loved them to [the] end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when supper had ended, the Devil now having put into the heart of Judas Iscariot [the son] of Simon to betray Him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into [His] hands, and that He had come from God and went to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He rose up from supper and laid aside [His] garments. And He took a towel and girded Himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">After that He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe [them] with the towel with which He was girded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, Lord, do You wash my feet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus answered and said to him, You do not know what I do now, but you shall know hereafter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Peter said to Him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also [my] hands and head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has no need except to wash [his] feet, but is clean every whit. And you are clean, but not all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For He knew who would betray Him. Therefore He said, You are not all clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So after He had washed their feet and had taken His garments and had reclined again, He said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You call Me the Teacher, and Lord, and you say well, for I AM.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If then I, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">When Jesus had said this, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you shall betray Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the disciples looked upon one another, wondering of whom He spoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But there was one of His disciples leaning upon Jesus' bosom, the one whom Jesus loved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Simon Peter therefore signaled to him to ask whom it might be of whom He spoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And lying on Jesus' breast, he said to him, Lord, who is it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give the morsel when I have dipped [it]. And dipping the morsel, He gave [it] to Judas Iscariot, the [son] of Simon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">But no one reclining knew for what [reason] He spoke this to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For some thought, because Judas had the moneybag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy what we have need [of] for the feast; or that he should give something to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He then, having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Then He said to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her into [his] own [home].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After this, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, I thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then a vessel full of vinegar was set. And they filled a sponge with sour wine and put [it] upon hyssop, and put [it] to His mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, It is finished! And He bowed [His] head and gave up the spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the Jews, because it was Preparation, begged Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away, so that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath. For that sabbath was a high day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with Him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews) begged of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave permission. Then he came and took the body of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Nicodemus also came, who at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. And He revealed [Himself] this way:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Simon Peter, and Thomas called [the] Twin, and Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter said to them, I am going out to fish. They said to him, We will go with you also. They went out and entered into a boat immediately. And that night they caught nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the morning had come, Jesus stood on the shore. But the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jesus said to them, Children, do you have anything to eat? They answered Him, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find. Therefore they cast, and now they no longer had [the] strength to draw, from the multitude of fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then that disciple whom Jesus loves said to Peter, It is the Lord! Then hearing that it is the Lord, Simon Peter girded on [his] coat (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the other disciples came in a little boat (for they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits), dragging the net of fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then when they went up on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and a fish lying on [it], and bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jesus said to them, Bring from the fish which you have now caught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of big fish, a hundred and fifty-three. And [though] there were so many, the net was not torn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus said to them, Come, break fast. And none of the disciples dared to ask Him, Who are You? knowing that it was the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave to them, and in the same way the little fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This [is] now the three times Jesus was revealed to His disciples, [He] being risen from [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then when they broke fast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My lambs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He said to him the second time, Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you love Me? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He said to him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you love Me? Peter was grieved because He said to him a third [time], Do you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things, You know that I love You. Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were young, you girded yourself and walked where you wished. But when you grow old, you shall stretch forth your hands and another shall gird you and carry [you] where [you] do not wish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He spoke this signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, Follow Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following (the one who also leaned on His breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he who betrays You?)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, Lord, and what [of] this one?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said to him, If I desire that he remain until I come, what [is that] to you? You follow Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then this saying went abroad among the brothers, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him, He shall not die, but, If I desire that he remain until I come, what [is that] to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This is the disciple who testifies of these things and wrote these things. And we know that his testimony is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there are also many things, whatever Jesus did, which, if they should be written singly, I suppose the world itself [could] not contain the books that would be written. Amen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And having met with [them], He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father which you heard from Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in [the] Holy Spirit not many days from now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then, indeed, these coming together, they asked Him, saying, Lord, do You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And He said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in His own authority.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But you shall receive power, the Holy Spirit coming upon you. And you shall be witnesses to Me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to [the] end of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And saying these things, [as] they watched, He was taken up. And a cloud received Him out of their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And while they were looking intently into the heaven, He having gone, even behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">who also said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into the heaven? This same Jesus who is taken up from you into Heaven, will come in the way you have seen Him going into Heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they returned to Jerusalem from [the] mount Of Olive Grove, which is a sabbath day's [journey] from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when they had come in, they went up into an upper room, where Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James [the son] of Alpheus and Simon Zelotes, and Judas [the brother] of James;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">these all were continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication, with [the] women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore, it is right that one of these men who have companied with us all [the] time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">beginning from the baptism of John to that same day that He was taken up from us, to become a witness with us of His resurrection.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">being grieved that they taught the people, even to announce through Jesus the resurrection from [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">[And they] laid hands on [them] and put [them] under guard until the next day, for it was already evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But many of those who heard the Word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it happened on the next day that their rulers and elders and scribes, gathered to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name have you done this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Peter, filled with [the] Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">if we are examined today on a good work for an infirm man, by what this one has been healed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from [the] dead, in this [name] does this man stand before you whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This is the Stone which you builders have counted worthless, and He has become the Head of [the] Corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And there is salvation in no other One; for there is no other name under Heaven given among men by which we must be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and perceiving that they were unlearned and uneducated men, they marveled. And they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when they had commanded them to go aside out of the sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is plain to all those dwelling in Jerusalem. And we cannot deny [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But, so that it spread no further among the people, let us strictly threaten them, [that] they speak to no man in this name from now on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all, nor to teach in the name of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right before God to listen to you more than to God, you judge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way [as to] how they might punish them, because of the people. For all glorified God for that which was done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the man on whom this miracle of healing occurred was more than forty years [old].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And being let go, they went to their own company and reported what the chief priests and elders had said [to them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And having heard, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, Lord, You [are] the God who made the heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that is in them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">who by the mouth of Your servant David has said, Why did the nations rage and the people imagine vain things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For truly, against Your holy child Jesus, whom You have anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations, and [the] people of Israel, were gathered together</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">in order to do whatever Your hand and Your counsel determined before to be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your Word,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">by stretching forth of Your hand for healing, and miracles, and wonders may be done by the name of Your holy child Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled was shaken. And they were all filled with [the] Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul. And not one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own. But they had all things common.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power. And great grace was on them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For neither was anyone needy among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold [them] and brought the prices of the [things] that were sold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">and they laid [them] down at the apostles' feet. And distribution was made to every man according as he had need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Joses, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is, being translated, The son of consolation), a Levite, a Cypriot by race,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">a field being his, selling [it], he bore the proceeds and placed [them] at the apostles' feet.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he kept back [part] of the price, his wife also knowing, and brought a certain part and laid [it] at the apostles' feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart [for] you to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back [part] of the price of the land?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it [not] in your own authority? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And hearing these words, Ananias fell down [and] expired. And great fear came on all those who heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the younger ones arose, wound him up, and carrying [him] out, [they] buried [him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it was about the space of three hours afterward, when his wife (not knowing what was done) came in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Peter answered her, Tell me whether you sold the land [for] so much? And she said, Yes, [for] so much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Peter said to her, How [is it] that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of [the] Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband [are] at the door and they will carry you out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then at once she fell down at his feet and expired. And the younger ones found her dead, and, carrying [her] out, buried her beside her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And great fear came on all the church and on as many as heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And many miracles and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's Porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And of the rest no one dared to join himself to them, but the people magnified them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and more believing ones were added to [the] Lord, multitudes both of men and women;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So as to carry out the sick into the streets and place [them] on cots and mattresses, so that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And also a multitude came [from] the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick ones, and those being tormented by unclean spirits, who were all healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And rising up, the high priest, and all those who were with him (which is the [sect] of the Sadducees) were filled with anger,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the public custody.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But the angel of [the] Lord opened the prison doors by night and brought them out, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Go! Stand and speak all the words of this Life to the people in the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And hearing, they went into the temple about dawn, and taught. But the high priest came, and those with him. And they called the sanhedrin together, and all the elderhood of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But having come near, the officers did not find them in the prison. And returning, reported,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">saying, We indeed found the prison shut with all safety, and the keepers standing outside in front of the doors. But having opened it, we found no one inside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when the high priest and the temple commander and the chief priests heard these things, they were bewildered about them, what this might be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But one came, reporting to them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then the commander went with the officers [and] brought them, not with force, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And bringing them, they stood in the sanhedrin. And the high priest asked them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">saying, Did we not strictly command you [that] you not teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood on us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Peter and the apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed and hanged on a tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">This One God [has] exalted [to be] a Ruler and Savior to His right [hand] in order to give repentance and remission of sins to Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And we are His witnesses of these things. And [so] also [is] the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But those hearing were cut [to the heart], and they took counsel to kill them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then there stood up one in the sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law honored among all the people. And he commanded the apostles to be put outside a little space.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do [regarding] these men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For before these days Theudas rose up, boasting himself to be somebody; a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves to him; who was slain. And all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered and brought to nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">After this one, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the Registration, and drew away considerable people after him. Yet that one perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And now I say to you, withdraw from these men and let them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of men, it will come to nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest perhaps you be found even to fight against God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And they obeyed him. And calling the apostles, beating [them], they commanded not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then indeed they departed from [the] presence of the sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be shamed for His name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And every day in the temple, and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching the gospel: Jesus Christ.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And in those days, the disciples having multiplied, a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews occurred, because their widows were overlooked in the daily serving.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Twelve called near the multitude of the disciples and said, It is not pleasing to us, leaving the Word of God, to serve tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore, brothers, look out among you seven [men] being witnessed to, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this duty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the Word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the saying pleased all the multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of [the] Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicholas, a proselyte of Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They set these before the apostles. And having prayed, they laid hands on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the word of God was increasing. And the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was multiplying exceedingly; even a great crowd of the priests obeyed the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called [the synagogue] of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and from Asia, disputing with Stephen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And they set up false witnesses, who said, This man does not cease speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the Law.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And God said, I will judge the nation to whom they shall be in bondage, and after these things they will come out and will serve Me in this place.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And being jealous of Joseph, the patriarchs sold [Joseph] into Egypt. But God was with him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and plucked him out from all his afflictions, and He gave him favor and wisdom over against Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he appointed him governor over Egypt and all his household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and a great affliction. And our fathers found no food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But hearing grain was in Egypt, Jacob sent out our fathers first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And at the second [time] Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph's race was made known to Pharaoh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">And he said, How can I unless some man should guide me? And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the content of the Scripture which he read was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so He opened not His mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">In His humiliation His judgment was taken away, and who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">Then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same Scripture and preached the gospel of Jesus to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they passed along the way, they came on some water. And the eunuch said, See, here is water, what hinders me [from] being baptized?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And after they were silent, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Even as Simon has declared [how] God [at] the first visited the nations to take out of them a people for His name.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men from them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; Judas, whose last name was Barsabas; and Silas, chief men among the brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they wrote these things by their hand: The apostles and elders and brothers [send] greeting to the brothers, from [the] nations in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Because we have heard that certain ones who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, Be circumcised and keep the law! (to whom we gave no such command);</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">it seemed [good] to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who will also announce [to you] the same things by word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For it seemed [good] to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these necessary things:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">that you abstain from meats offered to idols, and [from] blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which, if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Be prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then indeed they being let go, they came to Antioch. And gathering the multitude, [they] delivered the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had read [it], they rejoiced at the comfort.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And remaining for a time, they were let go in peace from the brothers to the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But it pleased Silas to remain there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Also Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the gospel, the Word of the Lord, with many others also.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">Then there was sharp feeling, so as to separate them from each other. And taking Mark, Barnabas sailed to Cyprus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But choosing Silas, Paul went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of God,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And he came to Derbe and Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple named Timothy was there, [the] son of a woman who was a Jewess and who believed. But [his] father [was] a Greek.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul wanted him to go with him, and taking [him he] circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in those places; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And as they passed through the cities, they delivered to them the commandments to keep, the ones that were ordained by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then indeed the churches were established in the faith and increased in number daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And coming through the Phrygian and the Galatian region; and by the Holy Spirit being forbidden to speak the Word in Asia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">having come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia. But the Spirit did not allow them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then passing by Mysia, they came down into Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A certain man of Macedonia stood, begging him, saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And after he saw the vision, we immediately tried to go into Macedonia, gathering that the Lord had called us in order to preach the gospel [to] them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then having set sail from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next [day] to Neapolis;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we continued spending time in that city some days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was usually made. And we sat down and spoke to the women who came together [there].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And a certain woman named Lydia heard us, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God; whose heart the Lord opened, so that she attended to the things which were spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when she was baptized, she and her household, she begged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay. And she constrained us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And as we went to prayer, it happened that a certain girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by divining.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The same followed Paul and us and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who are announcing to us the way of salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And she did this many days. But being distressed, and turning to the [demonic] spirit, Paul said, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her! And it came out in that hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when her masters saw that the hope of their gain went out, having seized Paul and Silas, they dragged [them] to the market before the rulers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And they teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the crowd rose up against them. And tearing off their clothes, the judges ordered [them] to be flogged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And after laying on them many stripes, they threw [them] into prison, commanding the jailor to keep them safely;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">who, having received such a command, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And toward midnight Paul and Silas prayed and praised God in a hymn. And the prisoners listened to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened and all the bonds were loosened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And being awakened, and seeing the doors of the prison being open, drawing a sword, the jailer was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Then asking for a light he rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And leading them outside, he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved, and your household.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly, men who are Romans and uncondemned, they threw [us] into prison. And now do they put us out secretly? No indeed! But coming themselves, let them bring us out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the floggers reported these words to the judges. And hearing that they were Romans, they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And coming they begged [them]. And bringing [them] out, [they] asked [them] to depart out of the city.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And traveling through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And according to Paul's custom, he went in to them and reasoned with them out of the Scriptures on three sabbaths,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">opening and setting forth that Christ must have suffered, and to have risen again from [the] dead; and that this Jesus whom I preach to you is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And some of them believed and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, both a great multitude of the worshiping Greeks, and not a few of the chief women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the disobeying Jews becoming jealous, and having taken aside some wicked men of the market-loafers, and gathering a crowd, they set all the city in an uproar. And coming on the house of Jason, [they] sought to bring them out to the mob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brothers before the city judges, crying, These who have turned the world upside down have come here too,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">whom Jason has received. And these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And hearing these things, they troubled the crowd and the city judge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And taking security from Jason and from the rest, they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. They, when they arrived, went into the synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And these were more noble than those of Thessalonica, in that [they received] the Word with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily [to see] if those things [were so].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore many of them believed, and quite a few of honorable Greek women and men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the Word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And then immediately the brothers sent Paul away to go towards the sea, but both Silas and Timothy stayed there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And those conducting Paul brought him to Athens. And receiving a command to Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But awaiting them in Athens, Paul's spirit was pained within him, seeing the city full of idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then indeed he addressed the Jews in the synagogue, and those worshiping, and daily in the market, to those happening to be [there].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And certain philosophers from the Epicureans and from the Stoics met him. And some said, What will this babbler say? And others said, He seems to be an announcer of foreign demons (because he preached Jesus and the resurrection to them).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And taking hold of him, they led [him] to the Areopagus, saying, Are we able to know what [is] this new doctrine of which you speak?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For you bring certain strange things to our ears, therefore we are minded to know what these things mean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(For all the Athenians and strangers who were [there] spent their time in nothing else except to tell or to hear something newer.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And standing in [the] middle of the Areopagus, Paul said, Men, Athenians, I see that you [are] fearful of gods in everything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For [as I] passed by and saw the things you worship, I also found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Not knowing then whom you worship, I make Him known to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of Heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">nor is served with men's hands, [as though] He needed anything, [since] He gives life and breath and all things to all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And He has made all nations of men of one blood to dwell on all the face of the earth, ordaining fore-appointed seasons and boundaries of their dwelling,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">to seek the Lord, if perhaps they might feel after Him and find Him, though indeed [He] is not far from each one of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For in Him we live and move and have our being, as also certain of your own poets have said, For we are also His offspring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then being offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like gold or silver or stone, engraved by art and man's imagination.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Truly, then, God overlooking the times of ignorance, now He strictly commands all men everywhere to repent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">because He has appointed a day in which He is going to judge the world in righteousness by a Man whom He appointed, having given proof to all [by] raising Him from [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And hearing [of] a resurrection of [the] dead, some indeed mocked; and others said, We will hear you again concerning this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And so Paul departed from among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But certain men joined themselves to him and believed; among whom [were] Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And finding a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy [with] his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome) Paul came to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And because [he] was of the same trade, he stayed and worked with them; for they were tentmakers by occupation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he reasoned in the synagogue on every sabbath, persuading both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews [that] Jesus [is] the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they resisting and blaspheming, shaking [his] garment, he said to them, Your blood [is] on your own heads. I [am] pure from [it]. From now on I will go to the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he departed from there and entered into [the] house of one named Justus, [one] worshiping God, whose house was next to the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house. And hearing this, many of the Corinthians believed and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Lord spoke to Paul in [the] night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak, and be not silent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For I am with you, and no one shall set on you to hurt you, for I have many people in this city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he continued [there] a year and six months, teaching the Word of God among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Gallio [being] pro-consul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rushed against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">saying, This one persuades men to worship God contrary to the Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Paul being about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed then, it was anything wrong or wicked criminality, O Jews, according to reason I would endure you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if it is a question of a word and names, and [of] your law, you look [to it]. For I do not wish to be a judge of such things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he drove them from the judgment seat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat [him] before the judgment seat. And Gallio did not care for any of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Paul having remained many days more, taking leave of the brothers, he sailed from there into Syria. And Priscilla and Aquila were with him. And Paul had shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he came to Ephesus and left them there. But he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they asking [him] to stay a longer time with them, he did not consent</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but took leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that is coming in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you, God willing. And he sailed from Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had landed at Caesarea and had gone up to greet the church, he went down to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And after he had spent some time [there], he departed and went over the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This man was instructed in the way of the Lord. And [being] fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught the things of the Lord diligently, knowing only the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla heard him, and they took him and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And intending to pass into Achaia, being encouraged, the brothers wrote to the disciples to welcome him; who, having arrived, very much helped those who had believed through grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he mightily confuted the Jews publicly, proving by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it happened in the [time] Apollos was at Corinth, Paul [was] passing through the higher parts to Ephesus. And finding certain disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">he said to them, Have you received [the] Holy Spirit since you believed? And they said to him, We did not so much as hear whether [the] Holy Spirit is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said to them, Then to what were you baptized? And they said, To John's baptism.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Paul said, John truly baptized [with] the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe into Him coming after him, that is, into Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And hearing, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And as Paul laid [his] hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And all of the men were about twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And going into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when some were hardened and did not believe, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this happened over two years, so that all those living in Asia heard the Word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God did works of power through the hands of Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so that even handkerchiefs or aprons from his skin being brought onto the sick, the diseases were released, and the evil spirits went out of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And certain from the strolling Jews, exorcists, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those having evil spirits, saying, We adjure you [by] Jesus whom Paul preaches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But answering the evil spirit said, Jesus I know, and I comprehend Paul, but who are you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the man in whom the evil spirit resided leaped on them, and overcoming them he was strong against them, so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks who lived at Ephesus, and fear fell on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And many who believed came and confessed and showed their deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also many of those practicing the curious arts, bringing together the books, burned [them] before all. And they counted the prices of them and found [it to be] fifty thousand [pieces] of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the Word of God grew mightily and prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">After these things were ended, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, Paul purposed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have come there, I must also see Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And sending into Macedonia two who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he stayed in Asia for a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And about that time there was not a little a stir about the Way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For a certain silversmith named Demetrius was making silver temples of Artemis, providing not a little trade [for] the craftsmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And assembling the workmen about such things, he said, Men, you know that from this trade is our wealth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And you see and hear that, not only at Ephesus, but almost all Asia, this Paul having persuaded, he has perverted a huge crowd, saying that those which are made with hands are no gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And not only is this dangerous to us, our share coming into dispute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted for nothing, and her magnificence is also about to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And hearing, and becoming full of anger, they cried out, saying, Great [is] Artemis of [the] Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And all the city was filled with confusion. And they rushed with one accord to the theater, keeping a firm grip on Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Paul intending to go in to the mob, the disciples did not allow him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And some of the chief men of Asia, being his friends, sent to him, begging [him] not to give himself into the theater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then indeed others cried out, some other things; for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they dragged Alexander forward out of the crowd, the Jews thrusting him forward. And waving [his] hand Alexander desired to defend himself to the mob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for two hours' [time], Great [is] Artemis of [the] Ephesians!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And quieting the crowd, the town clerk said, Men, Ephesians! What one of you does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Artemis, and of That Fallen from the Sky?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Since these things cannot be spoken against, you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For you have brought these men, who are neither robbers of churches nor blasphemers of your goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Therefore if Demetrius and those craftsmen with him truly have a matter against anyone, the court days are [kept], and there are proconsuls. Let them plead against one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if you ask anything concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For we are in danger to be accused of revolt concerning today; there being no cause by which we may give an account of this crowding together.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after the uproar had ceased, calling the disciples and greeting [them], Paul left to go into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And passing through those parts, and exhorting them with much speech, he came into Greece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And spending three months [there], there [being] a plot against him by the Jews, being about to sail into Syria, he proposed to return through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Sopater of Berea accompanied him into Asia, and Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus as far as Asia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Going before, these waited for us at Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And after the days of Unleavened [Bread], we sailed away from Philippi and came to them at Troas [in] five days, where we stayed seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And on the first of the sabbaths, the disciples having been assembled to break bread, being about to depart on the morrow, Paul reasoned to them. And he continued his speech until midnight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there were many lights in the upper room where they were assembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And a certain young man named Eutychus [was] sitting on the window sill, Paul reasoning for a longer time, being overborne by sleep, he fell down from the third floor, and was taken up dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Paul went down and fell on him, and embracing [him] said, Do not be terrified, for his soul is in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And going up, and breaking bread, and tasting, and conversing over a long [time], until daybreak, he went out thus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And going ahead onto the ship, we sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul; for so he had appointed, intending himself to go on foot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And we sailed from there and came the next [day] across from Chios. And the next [day] we arrived at Samos, and we stayed at Trogyllium. And the next [day] we came to Miletus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not lose time in Asia; for, if it were possible for him, he hastened to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they had come to him, he said to them, You know how I was with you at all times, from [the] first day I arrived in Asia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and many tears and temptations happening to me through the plots of the Jews;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">[and] how I kept back nothing that was profitable, but have shown you and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now, behold, I am going bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall happen to me there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">except that the Holy Spirit witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But none of these things move me, neither do I count my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus [Christ], to testify fully the gospel of the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And now, behold, I know that you all will see my face no more, among whom I went proclaiming the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore I testify to you on this day that I [am] pure from the blood of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For I did not keep back from declaring to you all the counsel of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore take heed to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to feed the church of God which He has purchased with [His] own blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Also men shall arise from your own selves, speaking perverse things in order to draw disciples away after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore watch and remember that [for the time] of three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And now, brothers, I commend you to God, and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Yea, you yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs, and to those who were with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I have shown you all things, that working in this way we ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And saying these things, kneeling, he prayed with them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And there was much weeping of all, and falling on the neck of Paul, they ardently kissed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">grieving most of all over the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they went with him to the ship.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it happened when it was time to sail, we having been torn away from them, running direct we came to Cos; and on the next [day] to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia, going on board, we set sail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And sighting Cyprus, and leaving it on the left, we sailed into Syria, and came down to Tyre. For the ship was to unload its cargo there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And finding disciples, we stayed there seven days; who said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But when it was [time to] finish the days, going out, we traveled on. [And they] with all [the] women and children went with us as far as outside the city. And we kneeled down on the shore and prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And giving parting greetings to one another, we went up into the ship; and they returned to their own things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And finishing the voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais. And greeting the brothers, we stayed with them one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the next [day] those around [him] going out, Paul came to Caesarea. And entering the house of Philip the evangelist, [he] being of the seven, we stayed with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there were four virgin daughters to this one, who prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And as we stayed more days, a certain prophet from Judea named Agabus came down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And coming to us, and taking Paul's belt, and binding his hands and feet, he said, The Holy Spirit says these [things]: So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose belt this is, and will deliver [him] into the hands of  the] nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when we heard these things, both we and those of [the] place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Paul answered, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he not being persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be [done].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And after those days, making ready, we went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Also [some] of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing Mnason, a certain Cypriot, an old disciple with whom we were to lodge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And we being in Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And on the next [day] Paul went with us to James. And all the elders were present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And having greeted them, he related one by one what things God had done among the nations by his ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And hearing, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who believe, and they are all zealous of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they are informed concerning you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the nations to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise [their] children, nor to walk after the customs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What is it therefore? At all events a multitude will come together, for they will hear that you have come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore do this, what we say to you: We have four men who have a vow on themselves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">taking them, be purified with them, and be at expense for them, so that they may shave [their] heads. And all may know that what they have been told about you is nothing, but you yourself also walk orderly and keep the Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as to the nations who believe, we joined in writing, judging them to observe no such things, except only that they keep themselves from both idol sacrifice, and blood, and a thing strangled, and [from] fornication.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then taking the men on the next day, being purified with them, Paul went into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of the purification, until an offering should be offered for each of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews who were from Asia, having seen him in the temple, stirred up all the crowd and laid hands on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">crying out, Men, Israelites, help! This is the man who teaches all everywhere against the people and the Law and this place. And even he brought Greeks into the temple and has polluted this holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">(For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city before, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And all the city was moved, and the people ran together. And laying hands on Paul, they drew him outside of the temple. And immediately the doors were shut.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And as they [were] seeking to kill him, the news came to the chiliarch of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">[He] immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And seeing the chiliarch and the soldiers, they quit beating Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then going near, the chiliarch laid hold on him, and commanded [him] to be bound with two chains. And [he] demanded who he was and what he had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And others cried something else in the crowd, and not being able to know the certainty on account of the uproar, he commanded him to be carried into the fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when he came on the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers, because of the violence of the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And as Paul was about to be led into the fortress, he said to the chiliarch, Is it lawful for me to say a thing to you? And he said, Do you know Greek?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then are you not the Egyptian who before these days caused a riot, and led four thousand men of the assassins out into the wilderness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But Paul said, I am a man, a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen [of] no small city. And I beseech you, allow me to speak to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he allowing him, standing on the stairs, Paul signaled with [his] hand to the people. And much silence taking place, he spoke in the Hebrew dialect, saying:</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Men, brothers and fathers! Hear my defense now to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And hearing that he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, they all the more kept silence. And he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I am truly a man, a Jew born in Tarsus in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the exactness of the law of the fathers, being a zealous one of God, as you all are today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">[I] persecuted this Way as far as death, binding and delivering both men and women into prisons;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">as also the high priest bears witness to me, and all the elderhood. And receiving letters from [them] to the brothers, I traveled into Damascus indeed to lead those being bound to Jerusalem, in order that they might be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it happened to me, traveling and drawing near to Damascus: suddenly, about midday, a great light out of the heaven shone around me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I answered, Who are you, lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid. But they did not hear the voice of Him who spoke to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise and go into Damascus. And there it shall be told you all things which are appointed for you to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I did not see, because of the glory of that light; being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, testified to by all the Jews who lived [there] ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">coming to me and standing by, said to me, Brother Saul, look up! And the same hour I looked up on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you to know His will and to see the Just One, and to hear a voice out of His mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For you shall be His witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And now what do you intend? Arise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it happened to me, I returning to Jerusalem and praying in the temple, I became in an ecstasy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I saw Him say to me, Hurry and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I said, Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and beating those who believed on You throughout the synagogues.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was poured out, I also was standing by and consenting to his death, and holding the garments of those who killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And He said to me, Go, for I will send you far away to the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they listened to him until this word, and [then] they lifted up their voice, saying, Take such a one from the earth! For it is not fitting that he should live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as they shouted and tore [their] garments, and threw dust into the air,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">the chiliarch commanded him to be brought into the fortress, saying for him to be examined by scourging, so that he might know why they cried out so against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as they stretched him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And hearing, coming near the centurion reported to the chiliarch, saying, Watch what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And coming up the chiliarch said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? And He said, Yes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the chiliarch answered, With a great sum I bought this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was even born [free].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then immediately, those being about to examine him stood away from him. And the chiliarch also was afraid, fully knowing that he was a Roman, and that he had bound him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">On the next day, he desiring to know with certainty why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from [his] bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their sanhedrin to appear. And bringing Paul down, [he] set [him among them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And looking earnestly on the sanhedrin, Paul said, Men, brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Paul said to him, God shall strike you, whitened wall! For do you sit judging me according to the Law, and against law command me to be stricken?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they who stood by him said, Do you revile God's high priest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Paul said, I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Paul saw that the one part were Sadducees and the other part Pharisees, he cried out in the sanhedrin, Men! Brothers! I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee! I am being judged because of the hope and resurrection of [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there arose a great cry. And the scribes [who were] on the Pharisees' side arose and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And dissension arising, the chiliarch, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him from among them by force, and to bring [him] into the fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the following night the Lord stood by him and said, Be of good cheer, Paul, for as you have testified of Me in Jerusalem, so you also must bear witness at Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when [it] became day, some of the Jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they who made this conspiracy were more than forty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they came to the chief priests and elders and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore you, with the sanhedrin, inform the chiliarch that he bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you would inquire something more perfectly regarding him. And we are ready to put him to death before he comes near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And hearing of the ambush, Paul's sister's son, having come near, and entering into the fortress, he reported to Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And calling one of the centurions, Paul said, Bring this young man to the chiliarch, for he has a certain thing to tell him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So he took him and brought [him] to the chiliarch and said, Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to say to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And laying hold of his hand, and drawing aside privately, the chiliarch asked [him], What is [it] that you have to tell me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the sanhedrin tomorrow, as though they would inquire something more exactly about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But do not yield to them, for there are more than forty men of them lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him. And now they are ready, looking for a promise from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the chiliarch sent away the young man commanding, Tell no one that you have shown these things to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he called two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And provide animals, so that they may set Paul on them and bring [him] to Felix the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he wrote a letter in this way:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This man was taken by the Jews and would have been killed by them. Then I came with an army and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And being minded to know the charge for which they accused him, I brought him down to their sanhedrin;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">whom I found be accused of questions of their law, and having no charge worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it being revealed to me that a plot against the man was about to be [executed] by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, commanding his accusers also to say before you what [they had] against him. Farewell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then, indeed, taking up Paul, as it was commanded them, the soldiers brought [him] by night to Antipatris.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they had come to Caesarea and had delivered the letter to the governor, [they] presented Paul before him also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when the governor had read [the letter], he asked what province he was from. And when he understood that [he was] from Cilicia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">he said, I will hear you when your accusers have also come. And [he] commanded him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders and [with] a certain orator, Tertullus, who made a statement to the governor against Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And being called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Since we enjoy great quietness by you, and very worthy deeds are done to this nation due to your forethought, in everything and everywhere, most noble Felix, we accept with all thankfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But that I not hinder you further, I beseech you to hear us briefly in your fairness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we have found this man pestilent, and moving rebellion among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who also attempted to profane the temple, whom we took and would have judged according to our law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the chiliarch Lysias came with much force, taking [him] away out of our hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him, you yourself may know about all these things of which we accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the governor motioning to him to speak, Paul answered; Understanding you as being a judge of this nation many years, I cheerfully defend myself [as to] the things concerning myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You can know that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, nor making a gathering of a crowd; not even in the synagogues, nor throughout the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But I confess this to you, that after the Way which they call heresy, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things that are written in the Law and in the Prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of [the] dead, both of the just and unjust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And in this I exercise myself, always to have a blameless conscience toward God and men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Among which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd nor with tumult.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">These ought to be present before you and to accuse me, if they have anything against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Or else let these themselves say if they have found anything unjust in me while I stood before the sanhedrin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">unless it may be for this one voice that I cried out standing among them, that concerning a resurrection of [the] dead I am being judged by you today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And having heard these things, Felix put them off, knowing more accurately of the Way, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch has come down, I will examine the things concerning you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul and to let [him] have liberty, and not to forbid anyone of his own to minister or come to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and the Judgment to come, Felix trembled and answered, Go for this time, but taking time later, I will call for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He also hoped that silver would be given him by Paul, that he might free him. Therefore [he] also frequently sent for him [and] talked with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But after two years Felix welcomed a successor, Porcius Festus. And wishing to show a favor to the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then entering the province, after three days Festus went from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and they begged him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">asking a favor against him that he would send for him to Jerusalem, making a plot to kill him on way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then indeed Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea; he himself would depart shortly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then he said, those having power among you may go down with [me]. If there is a thing amiss in this man, let them accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And staying among them more than ten days, going down to Caesarea, on the next day sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he having come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood around and brought many charges against Paul, which they could not prove.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Defending himself, [Paul] said, Neither against the Law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended in anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Festus, wanting to please the Jews, answered Paul and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me about these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Paul said, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if I am an offender or have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if there is nothing of which these accuse me, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then conferring with the sanhedrin, Festus answered, You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And after some days king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause to the king, saying, A certain man has been left in bonds by Felix,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">about whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed [me], desiring judgment against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To them I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to destruction before he being accused may have the accusers face to face, and have had freedom to answer for himself concerning the accusation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore, when they had come here, without any delay I sat on the judgment seat the next [day] and commanded the man to be brought,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">about whom, standing up, the accusers brought against him no charge of which I suspected,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but they had certain questions about [their] own demon-worship, and about a certain Jesus dying, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And because I was perplexed about this question, I asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Paul having appealed to be reserved to the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be held until I might send him to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Agrippa said to Festus, I also would like to hear the man myself. And he said, Tomorrow you shall hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp and had entered into the auditorium with both the chiliarchs and principal men of the city, also Festus commanding, Paul was brought out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all those men present with us, you see this one about whom all the multitude of the Jews pleaded with me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I had perceived nothing he had committed worthy of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I determined to send him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">about whom I have no certain thing to write of him to [my] lord. Therefore I brought him before you, and especially before you, O king Agrippa, so that, after examination is made, I might have something to write.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to signify the charges against him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then stretching out his hand, Paul made a defense:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Concerning all of which I am accused by Jews, king Agrippa, I think myself happy being about to make defense before you today,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">you being especially expert in all customs and questions among the Jews. Therefore I beseech you to hear me patiently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Truly, then, all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth, which was at first among my own nation at Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">who knew me from the first, if they would testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now I stand and am judged for [the] hope of the promise made to our fathers by God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">to which [promise] our twelve tribes hope to attain, serving God fervently night and day. For the sake of this hope, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Why is it thought a thing incredible with you that God raises [the] dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I truly thought within myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">which I also did in Jerusalem. And I shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests. And they being put to death, I cast a vote.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I punished them often in every synagogue; I compelled [them] to blaspheme; and [being] exceedingly furious against them, I persecuted them even to the outside cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In which pursuit also traveling to Damascus with authority and power of decision from the chief priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">at midday, along the highway, O king, I and those with me saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun; shining around me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And all of us falling to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me? [It is] hard for you to kick against the goads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I said, Who are you, lord? And He said, I am Jesus whom you persecute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But rise and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of what you saw, and in what I shall appear to you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">delivering you from the people and the nations, to whom I now send you</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">in order to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan to God, so that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">After this, king Agrippa, I did not disobey the heavenly vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But to those first in Damascus, and Jerusalem, and to all the country of Judea, and to the nations, I made known [the command] to repent and to turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Because of these things, having caught [me] in the temple, The Jews tried to kill [me].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then having obtained help from God, I stand until this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said was going to happen;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">whether the Christ was] liable to suffer, whether first by a resurrection of the] dead He was going to proclaim light to the people and to the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he defending himself [with] these things, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you rave! Your many letters turn [you] to insanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But he said, Not to insanity, most noble Festus, but I speak words of truth and sanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For the king understands about these things, to whom I speak, even being bold of speech. For I am persuaded that not any of these things are hidden [from] him, nothing. For the doing of this was not in a corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Agrippa said to Paul, Do you persuade me to be a Christian in [but] a little?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Paul said, I would pray to God, both in a little and in much, that not only you, but also all hearing me today to become as I also am, except for these bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he having spoken this, the king and the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them rose up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And withdrawing, they spoke with one another, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to [one] named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' cohort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And boarding a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail alongside Asian places, we set sail, Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, being with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And on the next [day] we were landed at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul courteously and gave [him] liberty to go to his friends to receive care.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And setting sail from there, we sailed close to Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And sailing over the sea against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra of Lycia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy, and he put us on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And sailing slowly many days and with difficulty, coming abreast of Cnidus; the wind not allowing us; we sailed close to Crete, across from Salmone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And coasting along with difficulty, we came to a place named Fair Havens, near which was a city, Lasea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And much time having been used up, and the voyage already being dangerous, because the Fast was now already past, Paul warned [them] ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">saying, Men, I perceive that this voyage is about to be with much harm and loss, and not only much cargo and of the ship, but also of our souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the centurion was rather persuaded by the helmsman and the shipmaster, than by the things spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the port not being fit to winter in, the most of them advised to set sail from there, if by any means they might be able to get to Phoenix to winter; [which is] a port of Crete, looking toward [the] southwest and northwest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And a south wind blowing softly, thinking to have obtained [their] purpose, lifting [anchor], they sailed along close beside Crete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But not long after, a stormy wind called Euroclydon beat down [on] it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the ship being seized, and not being able to beat against the wind, giving way we were borne along.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And running under an islet being called Clauda, we hardly were able to become masters of the boat;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">which taking, they used helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they should fall into the sandbanks of Syrtis, lowering the tackle, so they were borne along.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And being exceedingly storm-tossed with a tempest, they made a casting on the next [day] ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And on the third [day] we threw out the ship's tackle with our hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And neither sun nor stars appearing in many days, and no small tempest pressing hard, now all hope that we would be saved was taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But there being much fasting, then standing up in their midst, Paul said, O men, being obedient to me [you] ought not to have set sail from Crete, and to have come by this harm and loss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there will be no casting away of life among you, only of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For tonight an angel of God stood beside me, whose I am and whom I serve,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">saying, Fear not, Paul! You must stand before Caesar. And behold! God has given you all those who sail with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore, men, be of good cheer, for I believe God, that it will be so, according to the way it was told me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But we must fall on a certain island.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when [the] fourteenth night came, we being carried about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors thought that they drew near some country.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">And fearing that we would fall on rocks, and casting four anchors out of [the] stern, they wished day to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and lowering the boat into the sea, pretending to be about to cast out anchors from [the] prow,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the boat, and let her fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And until day was about to come, Paul begged all to take food, saying, This [is] the fourteenth day that you continued waiting without food, having taken nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Therefore I beg you to take [some] food, for this is for your deliverance. For not a hair of your head shall perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And saying these things, and taking bread, he gave thanks to God before all, and breaking, he began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And all becoming cheered, they also took food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And we were, all the souls in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">And casting off the anchors, they left [them] in the sea; at the same time they loosened the rudder bands and hoisted up the foresail to the wind and held to the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And coming on a place between two seas, they drove the vessel. And indeed the prow sticking fast, [it] remained unmovable. But the stern was broken with the violence of the waves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the mind of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out and escape.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">But they expected him to be about to become inflamed, or to fall down dead suddenly, But over much [time] expecting and seeing nothing amiss happening to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And it happened the father of Publius was lying down, suffering fevers and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and praying and laying on his hands, he healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then this taking place, the rest who were having infirmities in the island also came, and were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">[They] also honored us with many honors. And on [our] setting sail, they laid on the things of [our] needs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And after three months we sailed in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian with an ensign, The Twin Brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Going around from there we arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind coming on, we came to Puteoli on the second,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">where finding brothers, we were asked to stay seven days. And so we went toward Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the brothers from there hearing of us, [they] came to meet us as far as [the] market-place of Appius, and Three Taverns. Seeing them, thanking God, Paul took courage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when we came into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the camp commander. But Paul was allowed to dwell by himself, with a soldier guarding him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And after three days it happened that Paul called together those being chief of the Jews. And they coming together, he said to them, Men, brothers, I did nothing against the people or customs of our fathers. I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">who, examining me, were of a mind to let [me] go because there was no cause of death in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But the Jews speaking against [it], I was constrained to appeal to Caesar; not as having anything to accuse my nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For this cause, then, I called for you, to see and to speak with [you]. For I have this chain around me for the hope of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they said to him, We neither received letters out of Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brothers who came declared or spoke anything evil of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But we think [it] right to hear from you what you think. For truly as concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they having appointed him a day, many came to him in [his] lodging; to whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them the things concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses and out of the prophets, from morning until evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And some indeed believed the things that were said, others did not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And disagreeing with one another, they were let go, Paul saying one word: Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">saying, Go to this people and say: Hearing you shall hear and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see and not perceive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the heart of this people was fattened, and they have heard with their ears dully; and they closed their eyes; lest at any time they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and understand with [their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore be it known to you that the salvation of God is sent to the nations, and they will hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he having said these words, the Jews departed, having much discussion amongst themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Paul remained two years in his own hired house. And he welcomed all who came in to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching those things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom, [and] without hindrance.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">always in my prayers, making request if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to you for the establishing of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And this is to be comforted together with you by our mutual faith, both yours and mine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, and was kept back until the present; that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the foreigners, both to the wise and to the unwise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So, as much as is in me [lies], I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are at Rome also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is [the] power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">because the thing which may be known of God is clearly revealed within them, for God revealed [it] to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the unseen things of Him from [the] creation of [the] world [are] clearly seen, being realized by the things that are made, [even] His eternal power and Godhead, for them to be without excuse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Because, knowing God, they did not glorify Him as God, neither were thankful. But [they] became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Professing to be wise, they became fools</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, and birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of [their] hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For they changed the truth of God into a lie, and they worshiped and served the created thing more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For this cause, God gave them up to dishonorable affections. For even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another; males with males working out shamefulness, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was fitting for their error.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And even as they did not think fit to have God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do the things not right,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And, O man, the [one] judging those who do such things, and practice them, do you think this, that you shall escape the judgment of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Or do you despise the riches of His kindness, and the forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But according to your hardness and your impenitent heart, do you treasure up wrath for yourself in a day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who will render to each according to his works;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But to those who indeed disobeying the truth out] of self-seeking, and obeying unrighteousness, will be] anger and wrath,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who has worked out evil; of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But He [will give] glory, honor and peace to every man who works good, to [the] Jew first and also to [the] Greek.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">For as many as sinned without Law will also perish without Law. And as many as have sinned within Law shall be judged through Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For it is not the hearers of the Law who [are] just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For when the nations, who do not have the Law, do by nature the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law unto themselves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and the thoughts between one another accusing or even excusing one another,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">[You] who boast in Law, do you dishonor God through breaking the Law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For the name of God is blasphemed among the nations because of you, as it is written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For circumcision truly profits if you keep [the] Law, but if you are a transgressor of the Law, circumcision becomes uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If then the uncircumcision keeps the ordinances of the Law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the Law, shall it not judge you, who through letter and circumcision [become] transgressors of the Law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he is not a Jew who [is one] outwardly, nor [is] circumcision that outwardly in flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">but he [is] a Jew who [is one] inwardly, and circumcision [is] of the heart; in spirit and not in letter; whose praise [is] not from men, but from God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then what [is] the superiority of the Jew? Or what [is] the profit of circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Much, by every way! Chiefly, indeed, because they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what? If some did not believe, will not their unbelief nullify the faith of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Let it not be! But let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That You might be justified in Your sayings, and will overcome when You are judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Is] God unrighteous who lays on wrath? (I speak as a man.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Let it not be! For then how shall God judge the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if in my lie the truth has more abounded to His glory why am I still judged as a sinner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And not [rather], (as we are wrongly accused, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do bad things that good may come? [Their] condemnation is just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What then? Do we excel? No, in no way; for we have before charged both Jews and Greeks all [with] being under sin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">as it is written: There is none righteous, no not one;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">there is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They are all gone out of the way, [they] have together become unprofitable, there is none that does good, no, not one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Their throat [is] an open grave, with their tongues they have used deceit, [the] poison of asps [is] under their lips;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">their feet [are] swift to shed blood;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">destruction and misery [are] in their way,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and the way of peace they did not know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But we know that whatever things the Law says, it says to those who are under the Law; so that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be under judgment before God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">because by the works of the Law none of all flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law [is] the knowledge of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But now a righteousness of God has been revealed apart from Law, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ, toward all and upon all those who believe. For there is no difference,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">whom God has set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness through the passing by of the sins that had taken place before, in the forbearance of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for the display of His righteousness at this time, for Him to be just and, forgiving the [one] being of the faith of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then where [is] the boasting? It is excluded. Through what law? Of works? No, but through the law of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Or [is He] the God of the Jews only, and not also of the nations? Yes, of the nations also,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">since [it is] one God who will justify circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Do we then make the Law void through faith? Let it not be! But we establish the Law.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What then shall we say that our father Abraham has found, according to flesh?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if Abraham was justified by works, he has a boast; but not before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But to him working, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But to him not working, but believing on Him justifying the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Even as David also says of the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness without works,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">[saying], Blessed are those whose lawlessnesses are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">blessed [is] the man to whom [the] Lord will in no way impute sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">[Is] this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">How then was it reckoned? Being in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he received a sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith [while still] uncircumcised; so that he might be [the] father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for righteousness to be imputed to them also;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and a father of circumcision to those not of the circumcision only, but also to those walking by the steps of the faith of our father Abraham during uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For the promise that he should be the heir of the world [was] not to Abraham or to his seed through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if they of the Law [are] heirs, faith is made void and the promise is made of no effect;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">because the Law works out wrath, for where no law is, [there is] no transgression.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore [it is] of faith so that [it might be] according to grace; for the promise to be made sure to all the seed, not only to that which is of the Law, but to that also which is of  the] faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">(as it has been written, I have made you a father of many nations) --before God, whom he believed, who makes the dead live, and calls the things [which] do not exist as [though they] do exist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">[For he] who beyond hope believed on hope for him to become the father of many nations (according to that which was spoken, So your seed shall be).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body already dead (being about a hundred years old) or the deadening of Sarah's womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He did not stagger at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and being fully persuaded that what God had promised, He was also able to perform.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now it was not written for him alone that it was imputed to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but for us also to whom it is to be imputed, to the ones believing on Him who has raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">who was delivered because of our offenses and was raised for our justification.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And not only [this], but we glory in afflictions also, knowing that afflictions work out patience,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and patience [works out] experience, and experience [works out] hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And hope does not make [us] ashamed, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through [the] Holy Spirit given to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For we yet being without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For one will with difficulty die for a righteous one, yet perhaps one would even dare to die for a good one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But God commends His love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Much more then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if [when] we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And not only [so], but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, even as through one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed on all men inasmuch as all sinned:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">for until the Law sin was in [the] world, but sin is not imputed [when] there is no law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is the type of Him who was to come;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but the free gift [shall] not [be] also like the offense. For if by the offense of the one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift in grace; which [is] of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the free gift [shall] not [be] as by one having sinned; (for indeed the judgment [was] of one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offenses to justification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they who receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by One, Jesus Christ.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore as by one offense [sentence came] on all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of One the free gift [came] to all men to justification of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the Law entered so that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised up from [the] dead by the glory of the Father; even so we also should walk in newness of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For if we have been joined together in the likeness of His death, we shall also be [in the likeness] of His resurrection;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [Him] in order that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Or are you ignorant, brothers; for I speak to those who know the Law; that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the married woman was bound by law to the living husband. But if the husband is dead, she is set free from the law of [her] husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So then [if], while [her] husband lives, she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, [so that] she is no adulteress by becoming another man's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So, my brothers, you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ so that you should be married to Another, [even] to Him raised from [the] dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sin worked in our members through the law to bring forth fruit to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now we having been set free from the Law, having died [to that] in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not [in] oldness of the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? Let it not be said! But I did not know sin except through the law. For also I did not know lust except the law said, You shall not lust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all kinds of lust. For apart from law sin [was] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For I was alive without the law once. But when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the commandment, which [was] to life, was found [to be] death to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed [me].</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Then has that [which is] good become death to me? Let it not be! But sin, that it might appear [to be] sin, working death in me by [that which is] good; in order that sin might become exceedingly sinful by the commandment.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">So that the one resisting the authority resists the ordinance of God; and the ones who resist will receive judgment to themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the bad. And do you desire to be not afraid of the authority? Do the good, and you shall have praise from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is a servant of God to you for good. For if you practice evil, be afraid, for it does not bear the sword in vain; for it is a servant of God, a revenger for wrath on him who does evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore [you] must be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For because of this you also pay taxes. For they are God's servants, always giving attention to this very thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore give to all [their] dues; to the [one due] tax, the tax; tribute to whom tribute [is due], fear to whom fear [is due], and honor to whom honor [is due].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves another has fulfilled the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For: Do not commit adultery; do not murder; do not steal; do not bear false witness; do not lust; and if [there is] any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Love works no ill to its neighbor, therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This also, knowing the time, that [it is] already time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation [is] nearer than when we believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The night [is] far spent, the day is at hand; therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Let us walk becomingly, as in [the] day; not in carousings and drinking; not in co-habitation and lustful acts; not in strife and envy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take thought beforehand for the lusts of the flesh.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And receive him who is weak in the faith, [but] not to judgments of [your] thoughts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For indeed one believes to eat all things; but being weak, [another] eats vegetables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do not let him who eats despise him who does not eat; and do not let him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Who are you that judges another's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. But he will stand, for God is able to make him stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">One indeed esteems a day above [another] day; and [another] esteems every day [alike]. Let each one be fully assured in his own mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He who regards the day regards [it] to the Lord; and he not regarding the day, does not regard [it] to the Lord. He who eats, eats to [the] Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, does not eat to [the Lord, and gives God thanks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For both if we live, we live to [the] Lord; and if we die, we die to [the] Lord. Therefore both if we live, and if we die, we are the Lord's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For this Christ both died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord both of [the] dead and living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But why do you judge your brother? Or also why do you despise your brother? For all shall stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For it is written,  As] I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then each one of us will give account concerning himself to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then let us not judge one another any more, but rather judge this, not to put a stumbling-block or an offense toward his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I know and am persuaded in [the] Lord Jesus, that nothing by itself [is] common; except to him who esteems anything to be common, [it is] common.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if your brother is grieved with [your] food, you no longer walk according to love. Do not with your food destroy him for whom Christ died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then do not let your good be spoken evil of,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in [the] Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he who serves Christ in these things [is] well-pleasing to God, and approved by men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So then let us pursue the things of peace, and the things for building up one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Do not undo the work of God for food. Truly, all things indeed [are] clean, but [it is] bad to the man eating because of a stumbling-block.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">[It is] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [anything] by which your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Do you have faith? Have [it] to yourself before God. Blessed [is] he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But, the one doubting, if he eats, [he] has been condemned, because it is not of faith; and all that [is] not of faith is sin.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then we who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Let every one of us please [his] neighbor for [his] good, to building up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, so that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And may the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like minded toward one another according to Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">so that with one mind [and] one mouth you may glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore receive one another as Christ also received us, to [the] glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I say, Jesus Christ has become a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises [made] to the fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and that the nations might glorify God for [His] mercy, as it is written, For this cause I will confess to You in the nations, and I will praise Your name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And again He says, Rejoice, O nations, with His people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And again, Praise the Lord, all the nations, and praise Him, all the peoples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And again Isaiah says, There shall be a root of Jesse, and He who shall rise to reign over the nations, in Him shall the nations trust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope through the power of [the] Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But, brothers, I wrote to you boldly, as reminding you in part, because of the grace that is given to me by God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the nations, ministering the gospel of God, so that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, being sanctified by [the] Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore I have boasting in Christ Jesus [as to] the things pertaining to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ did not work out by me for [the] obedience of the nations in word and deed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">in power of miracles and wonders, in power of [the] Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem, and all around to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yea, so I have been eager to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man's foundation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but as it is written, To whom nothing was said about Him, they shall see. And they who have not heard shall understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For this cause I also have been greatly hindered from coming to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But now, having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">whenever I may go into Spain, I will come to you. For [in] traveling through I hope to see you, and to be set forward there by you, if first I may be filled of you in part.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But now I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For it has pleased those of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Truly it has pleased them, and they are their debtors. For if the nations have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in fleshly things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore when I have completed this, and have sealed this fruit to them, I will come by you into Spain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And I am sure that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of [the] blessing of the gospel of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But I exhort you, brothers, for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in [your] prayers to God for me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">that I may be delivered from those disbelieving in Judea, and that my service which [I have] for Jerusalem may be accepted by the saints;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">so that [I may] come to you with joy by [the] will of God, and may be refreshed with you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ through [the] will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called out with all those in every place who call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Grace [be] to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I thank my God always on your behalf [for] the grace of God given you in Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that in everything you are enriched by Him, [in] all speech and in all knowledge;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that you come behind in no gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He shall also confirm you to [the] end, [that you may be] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God [is] faithful, by whom you were called to [the] fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But I exhort you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, [that] you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But I say this, that every one of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides these, I do not know if I baptized any other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel; not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the preaching of the cross is foolishness to those being lost, but to us being saved, [it is] the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will set aside the understanding of the perceiving ones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Where [is the] wise? Where [is the] scribe? Where [is the] lawyer of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For since, in the wisdom of God, the world [by] wisdom did not know God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the Jews ask for a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But to them, the called-out ones, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is] the power of God and the wisdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Because the foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and the weak thing of God is stronger than men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For you see your calling, brothers, that not many wise men according to the flesh [are called], not many mighty, not many noble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and God has chosen the base things of the world, and things which are despised, and things which are not, in order to bring to nothing things that are;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">so that no flesh should glory in His presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And I, brothers, when I came to you, did not come with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I was with you in weakness and in fear, and in much trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And my speech and my preaching [was] not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the] Spirit and of power,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">so that your faith should not stand in [the] wisdom of men, but in [the] power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But, we speak wisdom among those who are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, that come to nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we speak [the] wisdom of God in a mystery, which God has hidden, predetermining it before the world for our glory;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">which none of the rulers of this world knew (for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But God has revealed [them] to us by His Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For who among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of man within him? So also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit from God, so that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These things we also speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the] Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But the natural man does not receive the things of [the] Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; neither can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged by no one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">I have fed you with milk and not with solid food, for you were not yet able [to bear it]; nor are you able even now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For you are yet carnal. For in that [there is] among you envyings and strife and divisions, are you not carnal, and [do you not] walk according to men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For while one says, I am of Paul; and another, I [am] of Apollos; are you not carnal?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Who then is Paul, and who [is] Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So then neither is he who plants anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So he planting, and he watering, are one, and each one shall receive [his] own reward according to [his] own labor.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">If anyone's work shall be burned up, he shall suffer loss. But he shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If anyone defiles the temple of God, God shall destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool so that he may be wise.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then shall each one have praise of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And these things, brothers, I have [in a figure] transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that you might learn in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, so that no one of you may [be] puffed up against one another.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">In the same way [He took] the cup also, after supping, saying, This cup is the New Covenant in My blood; as often as you drink it, do this in remembrance of Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until He shall come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So that whoever shall eat this bread and drink [this] cup of the Lord unworthily, he will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread and drink of that cup.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For he who eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For this cause many among you [are] weak and sickly, and many sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But when we are judged, we are chastened by [the] Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So that, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But if anyone hungers, let him eat at home, so that you do not come together to condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brothers, I would not have you ignorant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You know that being led away, you nations were led to dumb idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by [the] Spirit of God says Jesus [is] a curse, and [that] no one can say that Jesus [is] Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But there are differences of gifts, but the same Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there are differences of workings, but it is the same God working all things in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But to each one is given the showing forth of the Spirit to [our] profit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For through the Spirit is given to one a word of wisdom; and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and to another faith by the same Spirit; and to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and to another workings of powers, to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to another kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing separately to each one as He desires.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, [are] one body; so also [is] Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For also by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free, even all were made to drink into one Spirit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But much rather the members of the body seeming to be weaker are necessary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And those [members] of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we put more abundant honor around [them]. And our unpresentable [members] have more abundant propriety.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For our presentable [members] have no need, but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the [member] having need;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">that there not be division in the body, but [that] the members should have the same care for one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with [it]; if one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And you are the body of Christ, and members in part.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And God set some in the church, firstly, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers, then works of power, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, kinds of languages.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Charity never fails. But if [there are] prophecies, they will be abolished; if tongues, they shall cease; if knowledge, it will be abolished.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">When I was an infant, I spoke as an infant, I thought as an infant, I reasoned as an infant. But when I became a man, I did away with the things of an infant.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Follow after charity and desire spiritual [things], but rather that you may prophesy.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But he who prophesies speaks to men [for] building up, and exhortation, and comfort.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">I wish all of you to speak in languages, but rather that you may prophesy; for greater [is] he prophesying than he speaking in tongues, unless he interpret so that the church may receive building up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you, except I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yet lifeless things giving a sound, whether flute or harp, if they do not give a distinction in the sound, how will it be known what is being piped or harped?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">So also you, if you do not give a clear word through the language, how will it be known what [is] being said? For you will be speaking into the air.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So it may be many kinds of sounds are in [the] world, and not one [is] without a distinct sound.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore if I do not know the power of the sound, I will be a foreigner to him speaking, and he speaking [will be] a foreigner to me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">I thank my God [that] I speak more languages than all of you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">yet in a church I desire to speak five words with my mind, so that I might also teach others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">In the law it is written, By other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people, and even so they will not hear Me, says the Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Then how is it, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be for building up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">If one speaks in a language, [let it be] by two, or [at] the most three, and in succession. And let one interpret.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">If [a revelation] is revealed to another sitting by, let the first be silent.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And the spirits of the prophets [are] subject to the prophets.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and in which you stand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">by which you also are being kept safe, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the Twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Afterward He was seen by over five hundred brothers at once, of whom the greater part remain until this present day, but also some fell asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Afterward He was seen by James, then by all the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And last of all He was seen by me also, as one born out of time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For I am the least of the apostles and am not sufficient to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace which [was] toward me has not been without fruit, but I labored more abundantly than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore whether [it was] I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But if Christ is proclaimed, that He was raised from [the] dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation [is] worthless, and your faith [is] also worthless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And we are also found [to be] false witnesses of God, because we testified of God that He raised Christ; whom He did not raise if the dead are not raised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For if [the] dead are not raised, then Christ is not raised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if Christ is not raised, your faith [is] foolish; you are yet in your sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then also those that fell asleep in Christ were lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But now Christ has risen from [the] dead, [and] has become the firstfruit of those who slept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For since death [is] through man, the resurrection of [the] dead also [is] through a Man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all will be made alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But each in [his] own order: Christ the first-fruit, and afterward they who are Christ's at His coming;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">then [is] the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God, even the Father; when He makes to cease all rule and all authority and power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">for it is right for Him to reign until He has put all the enemies under His feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The last enemy made to cease [is] death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For He put all things under His feet. But when He says that all things have been put under [His feet], it is plain that [it] excepts Him who has put all things under Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subject to Him who has subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all things in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Otherwise, what will they do, those being baptized on behalf of [the] dead? If the dead are not at all raised, why indeed are they baptized on behalf of [the] dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And why are we also in danger every hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Day by day I die, by your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">If according to man I fought with beasts in Ephesus, what advantage is to me if [the] dead are not raised? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Do not be deceived; evil companionships corrupt good habits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Be righteously awake, and sin not; for some have ignorance of God. I speak [this] to your shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But someone will say, How are the dead raised up, and with what body do they come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Foolish one! What you sow is not made alive unless it dies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And what you sow, you do not sow the body that [is] going to be, but a bare grain (perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And God gives it a body as it has pleased Him, and to each of the seeds its own body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">All flesh [is] not the same flesh; but one [kind of] flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fish, and another of birds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">[There are] also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly [is] truly different, and that of the earthly different;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">one glory of [the] sun, and another glory of [the] moon, and another glory of [the] stars; for [one] star differs from [another] star in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So also the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And so it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul, the last Adam was a life-giving Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But not the spiritual first, but the natural; afterward the spiritual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The first man [was] out of earth, earthy; the second Man [was] the Lord from Heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="50">And I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit [the] kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Behold, I speak a mystery to you; we shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">in a moment, in a glance of an eye, at the last trumpet. For a trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall all be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and when this mortal shall put on immortality, then will take place the word that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="56">The sting of death [is] sin, and the strength of sin [is] the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">But thanks [be] to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">So that, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not without fruit in the Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I would that you were bearing with me a little in foolishness; but indeed bear with me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, so your thoughts should be corrupted from the simplicity due to Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Indeed, it is not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of [the] Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I know a man in Christ fourteen years before (whether in [the] body, I do not know; or outside of [the] body, I do not know; God knows) such a one [was] caught up to [the] third Heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">I will glory of such a one, yet I will not boast on my behalf, except in my weaknesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For if I desire to boast, I shall not be foolish. For I will speak the truth. But I spare, lest anyone should think of me as [being] beyond what he sees me, or hears of me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and by the surpassing revelations, lest I be made haughty, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be made haughty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For this thing I besought the Lord three times, that it might depart from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And He said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may overshadow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore I am pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am powerful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I have become foolish boasting. You compelled me. For I ought to be commended by you. For I lacked nothing of the highest apostles, if even I am nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Truly the signs of the apostle were worked out among you in all patience, in miracles and in wonders, and by works of power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For what is it in which you were inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, a third [time] I am ready to come to you. And I will not burden you, for I do not seek your things, but you. For the children ought not to lay up treasure for the parents, but the parents for the children.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me (who is not weak toward you, but is powerful in you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for even if He was crucified out of weakness, yet He lives by [the] power of God. For indeed even we are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by [the] power of God toward you),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith, prove your own selves. Do you not know your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are reprobates?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I trust that you will know that we are not reprobates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But I pray to God [for] you not to do evil, none. And not that we may appear approved, but that you should do the good things, though we are deemed to be reprobates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we have no power against the truth, but for the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we are glad when we are weak, and you are powerful. But we pray also for this, your perfection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore I write these things while absent, lest being present I may not deal sharply [with you] according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for pulling down.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But even if we or an angel from Heaven preach a gospel to you beside what we preached to you, let him be accursed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As we said before, and now I say again, If anyone preaches a gospel to you beside what you have received, let him be accursed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And, brothers, I make known to you the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught [it] except by a revelation of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For you heard my manner of life when [I was] in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God with surpassing [zeal], and ravaged it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And I progressed in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being much more a zealot of the traditions of my fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and having called [me] by His grace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the nations, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those apostles before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again to Damascus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">But from those who seemed to be something (what kind they were then does not matter to me; God does not accept the face of man), for those seeming [important] conferred nothing to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But on the contrary, seeing that I have been entrusted [with] the gospel of the uncircumcision, as Peter to the circumcision;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">for He working in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision also worked in me to the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and knowing the grace given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave right hands of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we [go] to the nations, but they to the circumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Only [they asked] that we remember the poor, which very thing I was eager to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed [him] to his face, because he was to be blamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For before some came from James, he ate with the nations. But when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the rest of the Jews also dissembled with him, so as even Barnabas was led away with their dissembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before all, If you, being a Jew, live as a Gentile, and not as the Jews, why do you compel [the] nations to judaize?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We Jews by nature, and not sinners of the nations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">knowing that a man is not justified by works of the Law, but through faith [in] Jesus Christ; even we believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith in Christ, and not by works of the Law. For all flesh will not be justified by works of law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we also were found [to be] sinners, [is] Christ therefore a minister of sin? Let it not be [said] !</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I confirm myself [as] a transgressor.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">I have been crucified with Christ, and I live; [yet] no longer I, but Christ lives in me. And [that] life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith toward the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself on my behalf.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Did you suffer so many things in vain, if indeed [it is] even in vain?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And to Abraham and to his Seed the promises were spoken. It does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your Seed, which is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I say this, A covenant having been ratified by God in Christ, the Law (coming into being four hundred and thirty years after) does not annul the promise, so as to abolish it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if the inheritance [is] of Law, [it is] no more of promise; but God gave [it] to Abraham by way of promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Why then the Law? It was added because of transgressions, until the Seed should come [to those] to whom it had been promised, being ordained through angels in the Mediator's hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the Mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">[Is] the Law then against the promises of God? Let it not be [said]! For if a law had been given which could have given life, indeed righteousness would have been out of Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the Scripture shut up all under sin, so that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But before faith came, we were kept under Law, having been shut up to the faith about to be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So that the Law has become a trainer of us until Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But faith coming, we are no longer under a trainer.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Even so we, when we were infants, were in bondage under the elements of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, coming into being out of a woman, having come under Law,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and from [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">always in every prayer of mine making [my] request for you all with joy</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for your fellowship in the gospel from [the] first day until now;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will perform [it] until the day of Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">even as it is righteous for me to think this of you all, because you have me in your heart, inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partakers of my grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For God is my witness how greatly I long after you all in [the] bowels of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and [in] all perception;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">that you may distinguish [between] things that differ, that you may be sincere and without offense until the day of Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">being filled [with the] fruits of righteousness through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But I desire that you should understand, brothers, that the things [which happened] to me have fallen out rather to [the] furtherance of the gospel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other [places].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And most of the brothers in [the] Lord, becoming confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Some indeed even preach Christ because of envy and strife, and some also of good will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Those, indeed, preach Christ out of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But these [others] preach in love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">What then? Nevertheless, in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached. And I rejoice in this. Yet, also I will rejoice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and [the] supply of [the] Spirit of Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">according to my earnest expectation and hope that I shall be ashamed in nothing, but as always now Christ shall be magnified in my body with all boldness, whether it is by life or by death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But if [I] live in [the] flesh, this [is] the fruit of [my] labor. Yet I do not know what I shall choose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For I am pressed together by the two: having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But to remain in the flesh [is] more needful for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And having this confidence, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all, for your advancement and joy of faith,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">so that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Only let your conduct be as becomes the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you, or else am absent, I may hear of your [affairs], that you stand fast in one spirit, striving together with one mind for the faith of the gospel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and terrified in nothing by your adversaries. [For this is] to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For to you it is given on behalf of Christ not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear [to be] in me.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">If [there is] therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of [the] Spirit, if any tendernesses and mercies,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">then fulfill my joy, that you may be like-minded, having the same love, [being] of one accord and of one mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">[Let] nothing [be done] through strife or vainglory, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Do not let each man look upon his own things, but each man also [on] the things of others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who, being in the form of God, thought [it] not robbery to be equal with God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but made Himself of no reputation, and took [upon Himself] the form of a servant, and was made in [the] likeness of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself [and] became obedient unto death, even [the] death of the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore God has highly exalted Him, and has given Him a name [which is] above every name,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly ones, and of earthly ones, and of ones under [the] earth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and [that] every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to [the] glory of God [the] Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, cultivate your own salvation with fear and trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For it is God who works in you both to will and to do of [His] good pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Do all things without murmurings and disputings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">so that you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation. Among these you shine as lights in the world,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">holding forth the word of life, so that I may rejoice with you in [the] day of Christ, that I have not run in vain nor labored in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And you also rejoice [in] the same, and rejoice with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly to you, so that I also may be of good comfort when I know [your state].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For I have no one who is like-minded, who will naturally care for [your state].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For all seek their own, not the things which are of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore I hope to send him presently, as soon as I shall see the things about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But I trust in [the] Lord that I myself shall also come shortly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker, and fellow-soldier, but your messenger and he who ministered to my wants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For he longed after you all and was full of heaviness, because you had heard that he had been sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For indeed he was sick, coming near death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore I sent him the more eagerly, so that you may rejoice when you see him again, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore receive him in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such in honor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">because for the work of Christ he was near death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Finally, my brothers, rejoice in [the] Lord. To write the same things to you is indeed not grievous to me, but for you [it is] safe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision party.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we are the circumcision who worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinks that he has reason to trust in the flesh, I more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I was circumcised [the] eighth day, of [the] stock of Israel, [of the] tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews. As regards the Law, [I was] a Pharisee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">concerning zeal, persecuting the church; regarding the righteousness in the Law, blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But whatever things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But no, rather, I also count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them [to be] dung, so that I may win Christ</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and be found in Him; not having my own righteousness, which is of the Law, but through [the] faith of Christ, the righteousness of God by faith,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable to His death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I am pressing on, if I may lay hold of that for which I also was taken hold of by Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">My brothers, I do not count myself to have taken possession, but one [thing I do], forgetting the things behind and reaching forward to the things before,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Let us therefore, as many as [are] perfect, be of this mind. And if in anything you are otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yet, as to what we have already attained, let us walk in the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Brothers, be imitators together of me, and mark those who walk this way, for you have us [for] a pattern.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">(For many are walking, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, [as] the enemies of the cross of Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">whose end [is] destruction, whose god [is their] belly, and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, [those] who mind earthly things.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For our citizenship is in Heaven, from which also we are looking for the Savior, [the] Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">who shall change our body of humiliation so that it may be fashioned like His glorious body, according to the working of His power, even to subdue all things to Himself.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, my brothers, ones loved and longed for, my joy and crown, stand fast in this way in [the] Lord, beloved ones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I beg Euodia and Syntyche that they be of the same mind in [the] Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I also beg you, true yoke-fellow, help those women who labored in the gospel with me and with Clement, and others of my fellow-laborers, whose names [are] in the Book of Life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Rejoice in [the] Lord always. Again I say, Rejoice!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let your moderation be known to all men. The Lord [is] at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Finally, my brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things [are] honest, whatever [things are] right, whatever [things are] pure, whatever [things are] lovely, whatever  things are] of good report; if  there is] any virtue and if [there is] any praise, think on these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do those things which you have also learned and received and heard and seen in me. And the God of peace shall be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But I rejoiced in [the] Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again. Although you indeed did think, but you lacked opportunity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Not that I speak according to need, for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound. In everything and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Yet you did well in sharing my troubles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now you Philippians know also that in [the] beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as regards giving and receiving, except you alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my necessity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I do not say this because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But I have all, and abound. I have been filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things [which you sent], an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now unto God and our Father [be] glory forever and ever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All the saints greet you, most of all those who are of Caesar's household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, [an] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">who is [the] image of the invisible God, [the] First-born of all creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For all things were created in Him, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all things were created through Him and for Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And He is before all things, and by Him all things consist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And He is [the] Head of the body, the church, who is [the] Beginning, the First-born from the dead, that He may be pre-eminent in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For it pleased [the Father] that in Him all fullness should dwell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And through Him having made peace through the blood of His cross, it pleased the Father to reconcile all things to Himself through Him, whether the things on earth or the things in Heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And you, who were once alienated and enemies in [your] mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">if indeed you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and [are] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard [and] which was proclaimed in all the creation under Heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Faithful [is] the word: If anyone reaches out to overseership, he desires a good work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then it behooves the overseer to be without reproach, husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, well-ordered, hospitable, apt at teaching,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">not a drunkard, not contentious, not greedy of ill gain, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">ruling his own house well, having children in subjection with all honor.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling [their] children and households well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For they having served well gain a good grade for themselves, and much boldness in the faith, those in Christ Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But the Spirit expressly says that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">forbidding to marry, [saying] to abstain from foods which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For every creation of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For it is sanctified through the Word of God and prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Having suggested these things to the brothers, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and by the good doctrine which you have followed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But refuse profane and old-womanish tales, and exercise yourself to godliness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the present life, and of that which is to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Faithful [is] the Word, and worthy of all acceptance.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to be godly to their own house, and give back to [their] forebears what is due them; for that is good and pleasing before God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But if anyone does not provide for [his] own, and especially [his] family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do not let a widow be enrolled having become less than sixty years old, [the] wife of one man,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But refuse younger widows, for whenever they grow lustful against Christ, they desire to marry;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">having guilt because they have cast off the first faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And with it all they also learn [to be] idle, going around the houses; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things they ought not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore I want the younger ones to marry, bear children, guide the house, giving no occasion to the adversary because of reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For some have already turned aside after Satan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If any believing man or believing woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be charged, so that it may relieve those who are widows indeed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and doctrine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox treading out grain, and, The laborer [is] worthy of his reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Do not receive an accusation against an elder except before two or three witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Those who sin, rebuke before all, so that the rest also may fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I charge [you] before God and [the] Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Do not lay hands quickly on anyone, neither be partaker of [the] sins of others. Keep yourself pure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Drink water no longer, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and for your frequent infirmities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment. And some they also follow after.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let as many slaves as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name and doctrine of God may not be blasphemed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And those who have believing masters, let them not despise [them] because they are brothers. But rather let them serve, because they are faithful and beloved, those of the good service receiving in return. Teach and exhort these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If anyone teaches otherwise, and does not consent to wholesome words (those of our Lord Jesus Christ), and to the doctrine according to godliness,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">But they who will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into] many foolish and hurtful lusts which plunge men into destruction and perdition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the love of money is a root of all evils, of which some having lusted after, they were seduced from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But you, O man of God, flee these things and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">God, who at many times and in many ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">has in these last days spoken to us by His] Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">who being the shining splendor of [His] glory, and the express image of His essence, and upholding all things by the word of His power, through Himself cleansing of our sins, [He] sat down on [the] right of the Majesty on high,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">being made so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For to which of the angels did He say at any time, You are My Son, this day I have begotten You? And again, I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And again, when He brings in the First-born into the world, He says, And let all [the] angels of God worship Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And of the angels He says, Who makes His angels spirits and His ministers a flame of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But to the Son [He says], Your throne, O God, [is] forever and ever. A scepter of righteousness [is] the scepter of Your kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You have loved righteousness and hated iniquity, therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, You, Lord, have laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They shall perish, but You will remain. And [they] shall all become old as a garment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and as a covering You shall fold them up, and [they] shall be changed. But You are the same, and Your years shall not fail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But to which of the angels, did He say at any time, Sit on My right hand until I make Your enemies Your footstool?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for those who shall be heirs of salvation?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let [them] slip.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and if every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">how shall we escape [if] we neglect so great a salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by those who heard [Him] ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God [also] bearing [them] witness, both with signs and wonders, and with different kinds of miracles and gifts [of the] Holy Spirit, according to His own will?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For He has not put in subjection to the angels the world to come, of which we speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But one testified in a certain place, saying, What is man, that You are mindful of him; or the son of man, that You visit him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You have made him a little lower than [the] angels. You crowned him with glory and honor and set him over the works of Your hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You subjected all things under his feet. For in subjecting all things to Him, He did not leave anything not subjected to Him. But now we do not see all things having been subjected to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we see Jesus, who [was] made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that He by [the] grace of God should taste death for every [son].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For it became Him, for whom [are] all things and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons into glory, to perfect the Captain of their salvation through sufferings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For both He who sanctifies and they who are sanctified [are] all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">saying, I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And again, I will put My trust in Him. And again, Behold Me and the children whom God has given Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Since then the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise partook of the same; that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death (that is, the Devil),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and deliver those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For truly He did not take [the nature of] angels, but He took hold of [the] seed of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore in all things it behoved him to be made like [His] brothers, that He might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of [His] people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For in that He Himself has suffered, having been tempted, He is able to rescue those who are being tempted.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, holy brothers, called [to be] partakers of the heavenly [calling], consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also [was faithful] in all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For He was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who has built the house has more honor than the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things [is] God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Moses truly [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken afterward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Christ [was faithful] as a Son over his own house; whose house we are, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you will hear His voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">when your fathers tempted Me, proved Me, and saw My works forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore I was grieved with that generation and said, They always err in [their] heart, and they have not known My ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from [the] living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But exhort one another daily, while it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through [the] deceitfulness of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to [the] end,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">while it is said, Today if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For some, when they had heard, did provoke; however, not all who came out of Egypt by Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But with whom was He grieved forty years? [Was it] not with those who had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to whom did He swear [that they should] not enter into His rest, but to those who did not believe?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, a promise being left to enter into His rest, let us fear lest any of you should seem to come short of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For also we have had the gospel preached, as well as them. But the word [preached] did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we who have believed do enter into the rest, as He said, I have sworn in My wrath that they should not enter into My rest; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For He spoke in a certain place of the seventh [day] in this way: And God rested the seventh day from all His works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And in this place again, They shall not enter into My rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Since then it remains that some must enter into it, and since they to whom it was first preached did not enter in because of unbelief,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He again marks out a certain day, saying in David, Today, (after so long a time). Even as it is said, Today, if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So then there remains a rest to the people of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he who has entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God [did] from His.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore let us labor to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of unbelief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the word of God [is] living and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to [the] dividing apart of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in His sight, but all things [are] naked and opened to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Since then we have a great High Priest who has passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we do not have a high priest who cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted just as [we are, yet] without sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things [pertaining] to God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">who can have compassion on the ignorant and on those who are out of the way. For he himself also is compassed with weakness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And because of this he should, as for the people, so also for himself, offer for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called of God, as Aaron [was].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So also Christ did not glorify Himself to be made a high priest, but He who said to Him, You are My Son, today I have begotten You.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As He says also in another [place], You [are] a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">[For Jesus], in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications with strong cryings and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard in that He feared,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">though being a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And being perfected, He became [the] Author of eternal salvation to all those who obey Him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">being called by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">of whom we [have] much to say, and hard to be explained since you are dull of hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For indeed because of the time, you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again what [are] the first principles of the oracles of God. And you have become [in] need of milk, and not of solid food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For everyone partaking of milk [is] unskillful [in the] word of righteousness, for he is an infant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, [even] those who because of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, having left the discourse of the beginning of Christ, let us go on to full growth, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">of [the] baptisms, of doctrine, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And this we will do, if God permits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For [it is] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of [the] Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and have tasted [the] good Word of God and [the] powers of the world to come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and who have fallen away; it is impossible, I say, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify the Son of God afresh to themselves and put [Him] to an open shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">(For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth plants fit for those by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But [that which] bears thorns and briers [is] rejected and [is] a curse, whose end [is] to be burned.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation, though we speak in this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And we desire that each one of you show the same eagerness to the full assurance of hope to [the] end,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that you be not slothful, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For when God made promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no greater, [He] swore by Himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">saying, Surely in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For men truly swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all strife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In this way desiring to declare more fully to the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, God interposed by an oath,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">so that by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible [for] God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before [us] ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">where the Forerunner has entered for us, even] Jesus, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To him Abraham also gave a tenth of all. [He was] first by interpretation king of righteousness, and after that also king of Salem, which is king of peace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, [he] remains a priest continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now consider how great this man [was], to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And truly they [who are] of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priest, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the Law, that is, from their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And without all contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And here men who die receive tithes; but there he [receives them], of whom it is witnessed that he lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And if I may say so, Levi, also, who receives tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore if perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the Law), what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made in the law also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man gave attendance at the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it is still far more evident, since there arises another priest after the likeness of Melchizedek,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who is made, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For He testifies, You [are] a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For truly there] is a putting away of the commandment which went before, because of the weakness and unprofitableness of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did], by which we draw near to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And inasmuch as [He was] not made priest] without an oath</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(for those priests were made without an oath, but this one was made with an oath by Him who said to Him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You [are] a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they truly were many priests, because they were not allowed to continue because of death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore He is able also to save to the uttermost those who come unto God by Him, [since He] ever lives to make intercession for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For such a high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">who does not need, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice daily, first for his own [sins] and then for the people's sins. For He did this once for all, when He offered up Himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the Law appoints men high priests who have infirmity, but the word of the swearing of an oath, after the Law, [has consecrated] the Son forever, having been perfected.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the sum of the things which we have spoken [is this]: We have such a High Priest, who has sat down on [the] right of the throne of the Majesty in Heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Therefore [it is] necessary that this One have something to offer also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For if indeed He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the Law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">who serve the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was warned of God when he was about to make the tabernacle. For, He says See [that] you make all things according to the pattern shown to you in the mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much He is also the Mediator of a better covenant, which was built upon better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if that first [covenant] had been without fault, [then] no place would have been sought for the] second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For finding fault with them, He said to them, Behold, days are coming, says [the] Lord, and I will make an end on the house of Israel and on the house of Judah; a new covenant shall be,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day I took hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I did not regard them, says the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws into their mind and write them in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then truly the first [tabernacle] had also ordinances of divine service and an earthly sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the first tabernacle was prepared, in which [was] both the lampstand, and the table, and the setting out of the loaves, which is called Holies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And after the second veil [was] a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid all around with gold, in which [was] the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And over it were the cherubs of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat (about which we cannot now speak piece by piece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when these things were ordained in this way, the priests always went into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service [of God].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But once [in] the year into the second the high priest [goes] alone, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">the Holy Spirit signifying [by] this [that] the way into the Holiest of all was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For it [was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him who did the service perfect as regards the conscience,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">[which stood] only in meats and drinks, and different kinds of washings and fleshly ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Christ had become a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">nor by the blood of goats and calves, but by [His] own blood [He] entered once for all into the Holies, having obtained eternal redemption [for us].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">how much more shall the blood of Christ (who through [the] eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God) purge your conscience from dead works to serve [the] living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And for this cause He is the Mediator of the new covenant, so that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first covenant, those who are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For where a covenant [is], the death of him covenanting must be offered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For a covenant [is] affirmed over [those] dead, since it never has force when The one covenanting is living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">From which we see that neither was the first [covenant] dedicated without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For [when] Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the Law, [he] took the blood of calves and of goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, This [is] the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And almost all things are by the law purged with blood, and without shedding of blood is no remission.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore [it was] necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified [with] these, but the heavenly things themselves were purified] with better sacrifices than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Christ has not entered into the [Holy of] Holies made with hands, [which are] the figures of the true, but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Nor yet that He should offer Himself often, even as the high priest enters into the [Holy of] Holies every year with the blood of others</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">(for then He must have suffered often since [the] foundation of the world), but now once in the end of the world He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">so Christ was once offered to bear [the] sins of many. And to those who look for Him He shall appear the second [time] without sin to salvation.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For the Law which has a shadow of good things to come, not the very image of the things, [appearing] year by year with the same sacrifices, which they offer continually, they are never able to perfect those drawing near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For then would they not have ceased to be offered? Because the worshipers, when they had been once for all purged, would have had no more conscience of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But in those [sacrifices there is] a remembrance again of sins every year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore when He comes into the world, He says, Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but You have prepared a body for Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin You have had no pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I said, Lo, I come ( in the] volume of the Book it is written of Me) to do Your will, O God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Above, when He said, Sacrifice and offering, and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin You did not desire, neither did You have pleasure in them (which are offered according to the Law),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">then He said, Lo, I come to do Your will, O God. He takes away the first so that He may establish the second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">By this will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And indeed every priest stands daily ministering and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down [on the] right of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">from then on expecting until His enemies are made His footstool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Holy Spirit also is a witness to us; for after He had said before,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord; I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">also [He adds, their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore, brothers, having boldness to enter into the [Holy of] Holies by the blood of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">by a new and living way which He has consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, His flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and [having] a High Priest over the house of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and [our] bodies having been washed with pure water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering (for He is faithful who promised),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and let us consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is], but exhorting [one another], and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">but a certain fearful looking for judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He who despised Moses' law died without mercy on [the word of] two or three witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy of punishment, the [one] who has trampled the Son of God, and who has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For we know Him who has said, Vengeance [belongs] to Me, I will repay, says [the] Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge His people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">[It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">For you both sympathized with my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in Heaven a better and an enduring substance.</VERS>
