    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</VERS>

And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="42">And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="44">And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD'S people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beersheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="30">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="31">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="18" bname="Job" bsname="Job">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</VERS>
