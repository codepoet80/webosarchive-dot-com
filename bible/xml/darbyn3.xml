    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], on the fifth of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">On the fifth of the month, (it was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the look of glowing brass, out of the midst of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Also out of the midst thereof, the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled as the look of burnished brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And their faces and their wings were parted above; two [wings] of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they went every one straight forward: whither the Spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, as the appearance of torches: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright; and out of the fire went forth lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I looked at the living creatures, and behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, toward their four faces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The appearance of the wheels and their work was as the look of a chrysolite; and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not when they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Whithersoever the Spirit was to go, they went, thither would [their] spirit go; and the wheels were lifted up along with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When those went, they went; and when those stood, they stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up along with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And there was the likeness of an expanse over the heads of the living creature, as the look of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And under the expanse were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, a tumultuous noise, as the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and there was a voice from above the expanse that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And I saw as the look of glowing brass, as the appearance of fire, within it round about; from the appearance of his loins and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spoke unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me unto this very day;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and these children are impudent and hard-hearted: I am sending thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall they know that there hath been a prophet among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, and be not afraid of their words; for briars and thorns are with thee, and thou dwellest among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, and be not dismayed at their faces; for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear; for they are rebellious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I looked, and behold, a hand was put forth toward me; and behold, a roll of a book therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he spread it out before me; and it was written within and without; and there were written in it lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he said unto me, Son of man, eat what thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll which I give thee. And I ate, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For thou art not sent to a people of strange language, and of difficult speech, [but] to the house of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">not to many peoples of strange language and of difficult speech, whose words thou canst not understand: had I sent thee to them, would they not hearken unto thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee, for none of them will hearken unto me. For all the house of Israel are hard of forehead and stiff of heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead. Fear them not, neither be dismayed at them, for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said unto me, Son of man, all my words which I shall speak unto thee, receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great rushing, [saying,] Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and the sound of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, and the sound of a great rushing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and I sat where they sat; and I sat there astonied among them seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Son of man, I have appointed thee a watchman unto the house of Israel, and thou shalt hear the word from my mouth, and give them warning from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt certainly die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, that he may live: the same wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when a righteous [man] doth turn from his righteousness, and do what is wrong, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die; because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous acts which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And if thou warn the righteous [man], that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall certainly live, for he hath taken warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the valley, and there I will talk with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And I arose, and went forth into the valley, and behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And thou, son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee therewith, and thou shalt not go out among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And thou, son of man, take thee a brick, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast a mound against it, and set camps against it, and place battering-rams against it round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And take thou unto thee an iron plate, and put it [for] a wall of iron between thee and the city; and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it: this shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And thou, lie upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: the number of the days that thou liest upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I have appointed thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when thou hast accomplished them, thou shalt lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thyself from one side to the other, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And thou, take unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, [according to] the number of the days that thou liest upon thy side: three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And thou shalt eat it [as] barley-cake, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Jehovah said, So shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations whither I will drive them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, my soul hath not been defiled, and from my youth up even until now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or of that which is torn; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said unto me, See, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I break the staff of bread in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread by weight, and with anxiety; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">because bread and water shall fail them, and they shall be astonied one with another, and waste away in their iniquity.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife; a barber's razor shalt thou take; and cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard: and thou shalt take balances to weigh, and divide the [hair].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part, [and] smite about it with a knife; and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And thou shalt take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and thou shalt take of these again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire: from it shall a fire come forth against all the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem: I have set her in the midst of the nations, and the countries are round about her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And she hath rebelled against my judgments in wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for mine ordinances have they refused; and my statutes, they have not walked in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have been turbulent more than the nations that are round about you, [and] have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept mine ordinances, nor [even] have done according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Wherefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, verily because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also withdraw mine eye, and it shall not spare, nor will I have any pity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A third part of thee shall die by the pestilence, and shall be consumed by the famine in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And mine anger shall be accomplished, and I will satisfy my fury upon them, and I will comfort myself; and they shall know that I Jehovah have spoken in my jealousy, when I have accomplished my fury upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And I will make thee a waste and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it shall be a reproach, and a taunt, an instruction, and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments upon thee in anger, and in fury, and in furious rebukes: I, Jehovah, have spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When I send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are for [their] destruction, which I send to destroy you, then will I increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, which shall bereave thee of children; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee: I, Jehovah, have spoken.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And your altars shall be desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain [men] before your idols;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your sun-images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yet will I leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some escaped from the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they have been carried captives, when I shall have broken their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols; and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed, in all their abominations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they shall know that I [am] Jehovah: I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the abominations of the iniquities of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that is left, and is besieged, shall die by the famine: and I will accomplish my fury upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah, when their slain shall be among their idols, round about their altars, upon every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick terebinth, the places where they offered sweet savour to all their idols.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth [month], on the fifth of the month, that [as] I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell there upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I looked, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the look of glowing brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he stretched forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entry of the inner gate that looketh toward the north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the valley.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king appointed unto them a daily provision of the king's delicate food, and of the wine that he drank, to nourish them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the prince of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel he gave [the name] Belteshazzar, and to Hananiah, Shadrach, and to Mishael, Meshach, and to Azariah, Abed-nego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not pollute himself with the king's delicate food, nor with the wine which he drank; and he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not have to pollute himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And God granted Daniel favour and mercy before the prince of the eunuchs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king who hath appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces worse liking than the youths who are of your age? and ye would endanger my head with the king.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And Daniel went in, and requested of the king that he would give him time, that he might shew the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that they would desire mercies of the God of the heavens concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; For wisdom and might are his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And it is he that changeth times and seasons; He deposeth kings, and setteth up kings; He giveth wisdom to the wise, And knowledge to them that know understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">It is he that revealeth the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I thank thee, and I praise thee, O God of my fathers, Who hast given me wisdom and might, And hast made known unto me already what we desired of thee; For thou hast made known unto us the king's matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken in pieces together, and they became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them. And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Thou, O king, art a king of kings, unto whom the God of the heavens hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;</VERS>

And the dream is certain, and the interpretation of it sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The king answered Daniel and said, Of a truth it is that your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, because thou wast able to reveal this secret.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Whereupon at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then were these men brought before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them, Is it of purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image that I have set up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now if ye be ready at the time that ye hear the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, [well]: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast that same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace: and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. He spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Forasmuch as the king's commandment was rigorous, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that had taken up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste; he spoke and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the opening of the burning fiery furnace; he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come [hither].

      <VERS vnumber="27">And the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had had no power, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and who changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore I make a decree, that in every people, nation, and language, he who shall speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and his house shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that is able to deliver after this sort.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and before him I told the dream:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Its leaves were beautiful, and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the heavens;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">he cried aloud, and said thus: Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the beasts get away from under it, and the birds from its branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be bathed with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the decision by the word of the holy ones: that the living may know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">The tree that thou sawest, which grew and was strong, whose height reached unto the heavens, and the sight of it to all the earth;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which cometh upon my lord the king:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">The same hour was the word fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen; and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, till his hair grew like eagles' [feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto the heavens, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation.</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream; he told the sum of the matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of the heavens broke forth upon the great sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till its wings were plucked; and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And behold, another beast, a second, like unto a bear, and it raised up itself on one side; and [it had] three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and they said thus unto it: Arise, devour much flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird upon its back; and the beast had four heads; and dominion was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceeding strong; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another, a little horn, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I beheld till thrones were set, and the Ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was flames of fire, [and] its wheels burning fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I beheld therefore, because of the voice of the great words that the horn spoke; I beheld till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given up to be burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of heaven [one] like a son of man, and he came up even to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As for me Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the certainty of all this. And he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, [that] shall arise out of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the saints of the most high [places] shall receive the kingdom, and they shall possess the kingdom for ever, even to the ages of ages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then I desired to know the certainty concerning the fourth beast, which was different from them all, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and concerning the ten horns that were in its head, and the other that came up, and before which three fell: even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and whose look was more imposing than its fellows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I beheld, and that horn made war with the saints, and prevailed over them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most high [places]; and the appointed time arrived, and the saints possessed the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said thus: The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon the earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And as to the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall arise ten kings; and another shall arise after them; and he shall be different from the former, and he shall subdue three kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most high [places], and think to change seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and a half time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heavens, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high [places]. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So far is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared unto me, [even] to me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I saw in the vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was in the fortress of Shushan, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I lifted up mine eyes and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; and one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward, and no beast could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; and he did according to his will, and became great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged with him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; and he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the he-goat became exceeding great; but when he was become strong, the great horn was broken; and in its stead came up four notable ones toward the four winds of the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauty [of the earth].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And it became great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down [some] of the host and of the stars to the ground, and trampled upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">(And he magnified [himself] even to the prince of the host, and from him the continual [sacrifice] was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And a time of trial was appointed unto the continual [sacrifice] by reason of transgression.) And it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that one who spoke, How long shall be the vision of the continual [sacrifice] and of the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden down under foot?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said unto me, Until two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings: then shall the sanctuary be vindicated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, when I Daniel had seen the vision, I sought for the understanding of it, and behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I heard a man's voice between [the banks of] the Ulai; and he called and said, Gabriel, make this [man] to understand the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face; and he said unto me, Understand, son of man; for the vision is for the time of the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep stupor, with my face toward the ground. And he touched me, and set me up where I had stood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be at the end of the indignation: for at the set time the end shall be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The ram that thou sawest having the two horns: they are the kings of Media and Persia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the rough goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn that was between his eyes is the first king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now that being broken, whereas four stood up in its stead, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And at the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors shall have come to the full, a king of bold countenance, and understanding riddles, shall stand up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy marvellously, and shall prosper, and shall practise, and shall destroy the mighty ones, and the people of the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And through his cunning shall he cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he will magnify [himself] in his heart, and by prosperity will corrupt many; and he will stand up against the Prince of princes: but he shall be broken without hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the vision of the evening and the morning which hath been told is true; but close thou up the vision, for it is for many days [to come].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And I Daniel fainted, and was sick [certain] days: then I rose up, and did the king's business. And I was astonished at the vision, but none understood [it].</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by the books that the number of the years, whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishment of the desolations of Jerusalem, was seventy years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and I prayed unto Jehovah my God, and made my confession, and said, Alas Lord! the great and terrible God, keeping covenant and loving-kindness with them that love him, and that keep his commandments:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside so as not to listen unto thy voice. And the curse hath been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God: for we have sinned against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he hath performed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; so that there hath not been done under the whole heaven as hath been done upon Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jehovah hath watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he hath done; and we have not hearkened unto his voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And now, O Lord our God, who broughtest thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and hast made thee a name, as it is this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Lord, according to all thy righteousnesses, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; for because of our sins, and because of the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people [are become] a reproach to all round about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And now, our God, hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing is true, but the appointed time of trial is long; and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three full weeks were fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And on the four-and-twentieth day of the first month, I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man clothed in linen, and his loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and his body was like a chrysolite, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet as the look of burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I Daniel alone saw the vision; and the men that were with me saw not the vision, but a great quaking fell on them, and they fled to hide themselves.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and the palms of my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said unto me, O Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words which I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I now sent. And as he spoke this word unto me, I stood trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he said unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come because of thy words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">and also [on] Hamath [which] bordereth thereon; on Tyre and Zidon, though she be very wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Tyre hath built herself a stronghold, and hath heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold, the Lord will take possession of her, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Ashkelon shall see [it], and fear; Gazah also, and she shall be greatly pained; Ekron also, for her expectation shall be put to shame: and the king shall perish from Gazah, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; but he that remaineth, he also shall belong to our God, and shall be as a leader in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I will encamp about my house because of the army, because of those that pass by and that return; and the exactor shall not pass through them any more: for now have I seen [it] with mine eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion; shout, daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, thy King cometh to thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly and rIding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle-bow shall be cut off. And he shall speak peace unto the nations; and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant, I will send forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Turn again to the stronghold, prisoners of hope! even to-day do I declare I will render double unto thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Ask of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain; Jehovah will make lightnings, and he will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams: they comfort in vain. Therefore they have gone away as a flock, they are in distress, because there is no shepherd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for Jehovah of hosts visiteth his flock, the house of Judah, and maketh them as his majestic horse in the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every exactor together.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back again; for I will have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And [they of] Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their hearts shall rejoice as through wine; and their children shall see [it], and rejoice; their heart shall be joyful in Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Howl, cypress, for the cedar is fallen; because the noble ones are spoiled. Howl, ye oaks of Bashan; for the strong forest is come down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">A voice of howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Thus saith Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah, and behold, I will deliver men, every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and I will not deliver out of their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So I fed the flock of slaughter, truly the poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I destroyed three shepherds in one month; and my soul was vexed with them, and their soul also loathed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I said, I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die; and that which perisheth let it perish; and let them which are left eat every one the flesh of another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I took my staff, Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it was broken in that day; and so the poor of the flock that gave heed to me knew that it was the word of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I said unto them, If ye think good, give [me] my hire; and if not, forbear. And they weighed for my hire thirty silver-pieces.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And I cut asunder mine other staff, Bands, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jehovah said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who shall not visit those that are about to perish, neither shall seek that which is strayed away, nor heal that which is wounded, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their hoofs in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock! The sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye; his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye utterly darkened.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">In that day will I make the leaders of Judah like a hearth of fire among wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left; and Jerusalem shall dwell again in her own place, in Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But Herod the king having heard [of it], was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and, assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea; for thus it is written through the prophet:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And *thou* Bethlehem, land of Juda, art in no wise the least among the governors of Juda; for out of thee shall go forth a leader who shall shepherd my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod, having secretly called the magi, inquired of them accurately the time of the star that was appearing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and having sent them to Bethlehem, said, Go, search out accurately concerning the child, and when ye shall have found [him] bring me back word, so that *I* also may come and do him homage.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And having come into the house they saw the little child with Mary his mother, and falling down did him homage. And having opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Now, they having departed, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise, take to [thee] the little child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I shall tell thee; for Herod will seek the little child to destroy it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And, having arisen, he took to [him] the little child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">A voice has been heard in Rama, weeping, and great lamentation: Rachel weeping [for] her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Herod having died, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Arise, take to [thee] the little child and its mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they who sought the life of the little child are dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he arose and took to [him] the little child and its mother, and came into the land of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">but having heard that 'Archelaus reigns over Judaea, instead of Herod his father,' he was afraid to go there; and having been divinely instructed in a dream, he went away into the parts of Galilee,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">but John urgently forbad him, saying, *I* have need to be baptised of thee; and comest *thou* to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Jesus answering said to him, Suffer [it] now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffers him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jesus, having been baptised, went up straightway from the water, and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And the tempter coming up to him said, If thou be Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he answering said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the devil takes him to the holy city, and sets him upon the edge of the temple,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said to him, It is again written, Thou shalt not tempt [the] Lord thy God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Again the devil takes him to a very high mountain, and shews him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the devil leaves him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But having heard that John was delivered up, he departed into Galilee:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">But Jesus knowing [it], withdrew thence, and great crowds followed him; and he healed them all:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and charged them strictly that they should not make him publicly known:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul has found its delight. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall shew forth judgment to the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He shall not strive or cry out, nor shall any one hear his voice in the streets;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And that [same] day Jesus went out from the house and sat down by the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And great crowds were gathered together to him, so that going on board ship himself he sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and as he sowed, some [grains] fell along the way, and the birds came and devoured them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and others fell upon the rocky places where they had not much earth, and immediately they sprang up out of [the ground] because of not having [any] depth of earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but when the sun rose they were burned up, and because of not having [any] root were dried up;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and others fell upon the good ground, and produced fruit, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He that has ears, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the disciples came up and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he answering said to them, Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not given;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">for whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall be caused to be in abundance; but he who has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For this cause I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor understand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and in them is filled up the prophecy of Esaias, which says, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and beholding ye shall behold and not see;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">for the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes as asleep, lest they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But blessed are *your* eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous [men] have desired to see the things which ye behold and did not see [them], and to hear the things which ye hear and did not hear [them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">*Ye*, therefore, hear the parable of the sower.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">From every one who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand [it], the wicked one comes and catches away what was sown in his heart: this is he that is sown by the wayside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But he that is sown on the rocky places this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but has no root in himself, but is for a time only; and when tribulation or persecution happens on account of the word, he is immediately offended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he that is sown among the thorns this is he who hears the word, and the anxious care of this life, and the deceit of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he that is sown upon the good ground this is he who hears and understands the word, who bears fruit also, and produces, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel amongst the wheat, and went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But when the blade shot up and produced fruit, then appeared the darnel also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the bondmen of the householder came up and said to him, Sir, hast thou not sown good seed in thy field? whence then has it darnel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he said to them, A man [that is] an enemy has done this. And the bondmen said to him, Wilt thou then that we should go and gather it [up]?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he said, No; lest [in] gathering the darnel ye should root up the wheat with it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Suffer both to grow together unto the harvest, and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvestmen, Gather first the darnel, and bind it into bundles to burn it; but the wheat bring together into my granary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard [seed] which a man took and sowed in his field;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">which is less indeed than all seeds, but when it is grown is greater than herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it had been all leavened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from [the] world's foundation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he answering said, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil [one];</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil; and the harvest is [the] completion of [the] age, and the harvestmen are angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">As then the darnel is gathered and is burned in the fire, thus it shall be in the completion of the age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all offences, and those that practise lawlessness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and they shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field, which a man having found has hid, and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">and having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a seine which has been cast into the sea, and which has gathered together of every kind,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">which, when it has been filled, having drawn up on the shore and sat down, they gathered the good into vessels and cast the worthless out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Thus shall it be in the completion of the age: the angels shall go forth and sever the wicked from the midst of the just,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yea, [Lord].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And he said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man [that is] a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables he withdrew thence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And having come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence has this [man] this wisdom and these works of power?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then has this [man] all these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And they were offended in him. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, unless in his country and in his house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For Herod had seized John, and had bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And they said, Some, John the baptist; and others, Elias; and others again, Jeremias or one of the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He says to them, But *ye*, who do ye say that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Simon Peter answering said, *Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jesus answering said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed [it] to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And *I* also, I say unto thee that *thou* art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly, and hades' gates shall not prevail against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou mayest loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then he enjoined on his disciples that they should say to no man that he was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">From that time Jesus began to shew to his disciples that he must go away to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Peter taking him to [him] began to rebuke him, saying, [God] be favourable to thee, Lord; this shall in no wise be unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But turning round, he said to Peter, Get away behind me, Satan; thou art an offence to me, for thy mind is not on the things that are of God, but on the things that are of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Jesus said to his disciples, If any one desires to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For what does a man profit, if he should gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to each according to his doings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Verily I say unto you, There are some of those standing here that shall not taste of death at all until they shall have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And after six days Jesus takes with [him] Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">and lo, Moses and Elias appeared to them talking with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Peter answering said to Jesus, Lord, it is good we should be here. If thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles: for thee one, and for Moses one, and one for Elias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying, *This* is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And [his] disciples demanded of him saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first have come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he answering said to them, Elias indeed comes first and will restore all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But I say unto you that Elias has already come, and they have not known him, but have done unto him whatever they would. Thus also the Son of man is about to suffer from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the baptist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they came to the crowd, a man came to him, falling on his knees before him, and saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And I brought him to thy disciples, and they were not able to heal him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon went out from him, and the boy was healed from that hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the disciples, coming to Jesus apart, said [to him], Why were not *we* able to cast him out?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he says to them, Because of your unbelief; for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard [seed], ye shall say to this mountain, Be transported hence there, and it shall transport itself; and nothing shall be impossible to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered up into [the] hands of men,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they came to Capernaum, those who received the didrachmas came to Peter and said, Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What dost thou think, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute? from their own sons or from strangers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In that hour the disciples came to Jesus saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="42">for I hungered, and ye gave me not to eat; I thirsted, and ye gave me not to drink;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye did not clothe me; ill, and in prison, and ye did not visit me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then shall *they* also answer saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or ill, or in prison, and have not ministered to thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then shall he answer them saying, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye have not done it to one of these least, neither have ye done it to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And these shall go away into eternal punishment, and the righteous into life eternal.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ye know that after two days the passover takes place, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together to the palace of the high priest who was called Caiaphas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and took counsel together in order that they might seize Jesus by subtlety and kill him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but they said, Not in the feast, that there be not a tumult among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Jesus being in Bethany, in Simon the leper's house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">a woman, having an alabaster flask of very precious ointment, came to him and poured it out upon his head as he lay at table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But the disciples seeing it became indignant, saying, To what end [was] this waste?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">for this might have been sold for much and been given to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Jesus knowing [it] said to them, Why do ye trouble the woman? for she has wrought a good work toward me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For in pouring out this ointment on my body, she has done it for my burying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Verily I say to you, Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world, that also which this [woman] has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then one of the twelve, he who was called Judas Iscariote, went to the chief priests</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and said, What are ye willing to give me, and *I* will deliver him up to you? And they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And from that time he sought a good opportunity that he might deliver him up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now on the first [day] of [the feast of] unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said, Go into the city unto such a one, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near, I will keep the passover in thy house with my disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the evening was come he lay down at table with the twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And as they were eating he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And being exceedingly grieved they began to say to him, each of them, Is it *I*, Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he answering said, He that dips his hand with me in the dish, *he* it is who shall deliver me up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Son of man goes indeed, according as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up; it were good for that man if he had not been born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Judas, who delivered him up, answering said, Is it *I*, Rabbi? He says to him, *Thou* hast said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken [the] bread and blessed, broke [it] and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And having taken [the] cup and given thanks, he gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For this is my blood, that of the [new] covenant, that shed for many for remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But I say to you, that I will not at all drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then saith Jesus to them, All *ye* shall be offended in me during this night. For it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But after that I shall be risen, I will go before you to Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Peter answering said to him, If all shall be offended in thee, *I* will never be offended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, that during this night, before [the] cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter says to him, If I should needs die with thee, I will in no wise deny thee. Likewise said all the disciples also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and says to the disciples, Sit here until I go away and pray yonder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And taking with [him] Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then he says to them, My soul is very sorrowful even unto death; remain here and watch with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And going forward a little he fell upon his face, praying and saying, My Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me; but not as *I* will, but as *thou* [wilt].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Thus ye have not been able to watch one hour with me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] ready, but the flesh weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Again going away a second time he prayed saying, My Father, if this cannot pass [from me] unless I drink it, thy will be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And coming he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And leaving them, he went away again and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he comes to the disciples and says to them, Sleep on now and take your rest; behold, the hour has drawn nigh, and the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up has drawn nigh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and elders of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is: seize him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And immediately coming up to Jesus he said, Hail, Rabbi, and covered him with kisses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But Jesus said to him, [My] friend, for what purpose art thou come? Then coming up they laid hands upon Jesus and seized him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and smiting the bondman of the high priest took off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then saith Jesus to him, Return thy sword to its place; for all who take the sword shall perish by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Or thinkest thou that I cannot now call upon my Father, and he will furnish me more than twelve legions of angels?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks to take me? I sat daily [with you] teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But all this is come to pass that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Now they that had seized Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And Peter followed him at a distance, even to the palace of the high priest, and entering in sat with the officers to see the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And the chief priests and the elders and the whole sanhedrim sought false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. But at the last two false witnesses came forward</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">and said, *He* said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and in three days build it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And the high priest standing up said to him, Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus was silent. And the high priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us if *thou* art the Christ the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Jesus says to him, *Thou* hast said. Moreover, I say to you, From henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has blasphemed: what need have we any more of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">What think ye? And they answering said, He is liable to the penalty of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him, and some struck him with the palms of their hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">saying, Prophesy to us, Christ, Who is it who struck thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">But Peter sat without in the palace-court; and a maid came to him, saying, And *thou* wast with Jesus the Galilaean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But he denied before all, saying, I do not know what thou sayest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And when he had gone out into the entrance, another [maid] saw him, and says to those there, This [man] also was with Jesus the Nazaraean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">And again he denied with an oath: I do not know the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">And after a little, those who stood [there], coming to [him], said to Peter, Truly *thou* too art of them, for also thy speech makes thee manifest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately [the] cock crew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said [to him], Before [the] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went forth without, and wept bitterly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when it was morning all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus so that they might put him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And having bound him they led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Judas, who delivered him up, seeing that he had been condemned, filled with remorse, returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">saying, I have sinned [in] having delivered up guiltless blood. But they said, What is that to us? see *thou* [to that].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And having cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, he left the place, and went away and hanged himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, It is not lawful to cast them into the Corban, since it is [the] price of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And having taken counsel, they bought with them the field of the potter for a burying-ground for strangers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore that field has been called Blood-field unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet, saying, And I took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was set a price on, whom [they who were] of the sons of Israel had set a price on,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and they gave them for the field of the potter, according as [the] Lord commanded me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor questioned him, saying, Art *thou* the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, Thou sayest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he was accused of the chief priests and the elders, he answered nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then says Pilate to him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he answered him not so much as one word, so that the governor wondered exceedingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now at [the] feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd, whom they would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they had then a notable prisoner, named Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he knew that they had delivered him up through envy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But, as he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous [man]; for I have suffered to-day many things in a dream because of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should beg for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the governor answering said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate says to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the governor said, What evil then has he done? But they cried more than ever, saying, Let him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Pilate, seeing that it availed nothing, but that rather a tumult was arising, having taken water, washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am guiltless of the blood of this righteous one: see *ye* [to it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all the people answering said, His blood [be] on us and on our children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he released to them Barabbas; but Jesus, having scourged [him], he delivered up that he might be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus with [them] to the praetorium, gathered against him the whole band,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and having taken off his garment, put on him a scarlet cloak;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and having woven a crown out of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and, bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And having spit upon him, they took the reed and beat [him] on his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had mocked him, they took the cloak off him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And as they went forth they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; him they compelled to go [with them] that he might bear his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And having come to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a skull,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">they gave to him to drink vinegar mingled with gall; and having tasted [it], he would not drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And having crucified him, they parted his clothes amongst [themselves], casting lots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And sitting down, they kept guard over him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they set up over his head his accusation written: This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then are crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But the passers-by reviled him, shaking their heads</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou art Son of God, descend from the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">[And] in like manner the chief priests also, mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He saved others, himself he cannot save. He is King of Israel: let him descend now from the cross, and we will believe on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusted upon God; let him save him now if he will [have] him. For he said, I am Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the robbers also who had been crucified with him cast the same reproaches on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now from [the] sixth hour there was darkness over the whole land until [the] ninth hour;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">but about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And some of those who stood there, when they heard [it], said, This [man] calls for Elias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And immediately one of them running and getting a sponge, having filled [it] with vinegar and fixed [it] on a reed, gave him to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But the rest said, Let be; let us see if Elias comes to save him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus, having again cried with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And lo, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were rent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But the centurion, and they who were with him on guard over Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that took place, feared greatly, saying, Truly this [man] was Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And there were there many women beholding from afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee ministering to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">among whom was Mary of Magdala, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Now when even was come there came a rich man of Arimathaea, his name Joseph, who also himself was a disciple to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">*He*, going to Pilate, begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="61">But Mary of Magdala was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Now on the morrow, which is after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">saying, Sir, we have called to mind that that deceiver said when he was still alive, After three days I arise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Command therefore that the sepulchre be secured until the third day, lest his disciples should come and steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch: go, secure it as well as ye know how.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now late on sabbath, as it was the dusk of the next day after sabbath, came Mary of Magdala and the other Mary to look at the sepulchre.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And his look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And they go into Capernaum. And straightway on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there was in their synagogue a man [possessed] by an unclean spirit, and he cried out</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">saying, Eh! what have we to do with thee, Jesus, Nazarene? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass as he sowed, one fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And another fell on the rocky ground, where it had not much earth, and immediately it sprung up out [of the ground] because it had no depth of earth;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And he says to them, Do ye not know this parable? and how will ye be acquainted with all the parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The sower sows the word:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And others are they who are sown among the thorns: these are they who have heard the word,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">If any one have ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear; with what measure ye mete, it shall be meted to you; and there shall be [more] added to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For whosoever has, to him shall be given; and he who has not, even what he has shall be taken from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast the seed upon the earth,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">The earth bears fruit of itself, first [the] blade, then an ear, then full corn in the ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But when the fruit is produced, immediately he sends the sickle, for the harvest is come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he said, How should we liken the kingdom of God, or with what comparison should we compare it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">As to a grain of mustard [seed], which, when it is sown upon the earth, is less than all seeds which are upon the earth,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And continually night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying and cutting himself with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But seeing Jesus from afar off, he ran and did him homage,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and crying with a loud voice he says, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For he said to him, Come forth, unclean spirit, out of the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he asked him, What is thy name? And he says to him, Legion is my name, because we are many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now there was there just at the mountain a great herd of swine feeding;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass on [the] second-first sabbath, that he went through cornfields, and his disciples were plucking the ears and eating [them], rubbing [them] in their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But some of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye what is not lawful to do on the sabbath?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jesus answering said to them, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did when he hungered, he and those who were with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">how he entered into the house of God and took the shewbread and ate, and gave to those also who were with him, which it is not lawful that [any] eat, unless the priests alone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said to them, The Son of man is Lord of the sabbath also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass on another sabbath also that he entered into the synagogue and taught; and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the scribes and the Pharisees were watching if he would heal on the sabbath, that they might find something of which to accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But *he* knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, Get up, and stand in the midst. And having risen up he stood [there].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus therefore said to them, I will ask you if it is lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy [it]?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And having looked around on them all, he said to him, Stretch out thy hand. And he did [so] and his hand was restored as the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But *they* were filled with madness, and they spoke together among themselves what they should do to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it came to pass in those days that he went out into the mountain to pray, and he spent the night in prayer to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when it was day he called his disciples, and having chosen out twelve from them, whom also he named apostles:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And when he had completed all his words in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">But they, being come to Jesus, besought him diligently, saying, He is worthy to whom thou shouldest grant this,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jesus went with them. But already, when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent to him friends, saying to him, Lord, do not trouble thyself, for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wherefore neither did I count myself worthy to come to thee. But say by a word and my servant shall be healed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass afterwards he went into a city called Nain, and many of his disciples and a great crowd went with him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">This is he concerning whom it is written, Behold, *I* send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, in order that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But those by the wayside are those who hear; then comes the devil and takes away the word from their heart that they may not believe and be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But those upon the rock, those who when they hear receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a time, and in time of trial fall away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But that that fell where the thorns were, these are they who having heard go away and are choked under cares and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But that in the good ground, these are they who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">and coming to [him] they woke him up, saying, Master, master, we perish. But he, rising up, rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said to them, Where is your faith? And, being afraid, they were astonished, saying to one another, Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">And they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting, clothed and sensible, at the feet of Jesus. And they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And they also who had seen it told them how the possessed man had been healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And all the multitude of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were possessed with great fear; and *he*, entering into the ship, returned.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And it came to pass as he was praying alone, his disciples were with him, and he asked them saying, Who do the crowds say that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But they answering said, John the baptist; but others, Elias; and others, that one of the old prophets has risen again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said to them, But *ye*, who do ye say that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But, earnestly charging them, he enjoined [them] to say this to no man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said to [them] all, If any one will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">for whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, *he* shall save it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For what shall a man profit if he shall have gained the whole world, and have destroyed, or come under the penalty of the loss of himself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For whosoever shall have been ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his glory, and [in that] of the Father, and of the holy angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But I say unto you of a truth, There are some of those standing here who shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And it came to pass after these words, about eight days, that taking Peter and John and James he went up into a mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And as he prayed the fashion of his countenance became different and his raiment white [and] effulgent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And lo, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elias,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">who, appearing in glory, spoke of his departure which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But Peter and those with him were oppressed with sleep: but having fully awoke up they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And it came to pass as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But as he was saying these things, there came a cloud and overshadowed them, and they feared as they entered into the cloud:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">and there was a voice out of the cloud saying, *This* is my beloved Son: hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as the voice was [heard] Jesus was found alone: and *they* kept silence, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And it came to pass on the following day, when they came down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And lo, a man from the crowd cried out saying, Teacher, I beseech thee look upon my son, for he is mine only child:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it tears him with foaming, and with difficulty departs from him after crushing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And I besought thy disciples that they might cast him out, and they could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring hither thy son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But as he was yet coming, the demon tore him and dragged him all together. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child and gave him back to his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And all were astonished at the glorious greatness of God. And as all wondered at all the things which [Jesus] did, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Do *ye* let these words sink into your ears. For the Son of man is about to be delivered into men's hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them that they should not perceive it. And they feared to ask him concerning this saying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And a reasoning came in amongst them, who should be [the] greatest of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And Jesus, seeing the reasoning of their heart, having taken a little child set it by him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">and said to them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receives me, and whosoever shall receive me receives him that sent me. For he who is the least among you all, *he* is great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And John answering said, Master, we saw some one casting out demons in thy name, and we forbad him, because he follows not with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus said to him, Forbid [him] not, for he that is not against you is for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And it came to pass when the days of his receiving up were fulfilled, that *he* stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And he sent messengers before his face. And having gone they entered into a village of the Samaritans that they might make ready for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And they did not receive him, because his face was [turned as] going to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And his disciples James and John seeing [it] said, Lord, wilt thou that we speak [that] fire come down from heaven and consume them, as also Elias did?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But turning he rebuked them [and said, Ye know not of what spirit ye are].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And they went to another village.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And it came to pass as they went in the way, one said to him, I will follow thee wheresoever thou goest, Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven roosting-places, but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, allow me to go first and bury my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">But Jesus said to him, Suffer the dead to bury their own dead, but do *thou* go and announce the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord, but first allow me to bid adieu to those at my house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">But Jesus said to him, No one having laid his hand on [the] plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place where he himself was about to come.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to him, Rise up and go thy way: thy faith has made thee well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And having been asked by the Pharisees, When is the kingdom of God coming? he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">nor shall they say, Lo here, or, Lo there; for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said to the disciples, Days are coming, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they will say to you, Lo here, or Lo there; go not, nor follow [them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For as the lightning shines which lightens from [one end] under heaven to [the other end] under heaven, thus shall the Son of man be in his day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And as it took place in the days of Noe, thus also shall it be in the days of the Son of man:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">and in like manner as took place in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from heaven, and destroyed all [of them]:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And he spoke also a parable to them to the purport that they should always pray and not faint,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">saying, There was a judge in a city, not fearing God and not respecting man:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and there was a widow in that city, and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of mine adverse party.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he would not for a time; but afterwards he said within himself, If even I fear not God and respect not man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">at any rate because this widow annoys me I will avenge her, that she may not by perpetually coming completely harass me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge says.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And shall not God at all avenge his elect, who cry to him day and night, and he bears long as to them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I say unto you that he will avenge them speedily. But when the Son of man comes, shall he indeed find faith on the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he spoke also to some, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and made nothing of all the rest [of men], this parable:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Pharisee, standing, prayed thus to himself: God, I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I fast twice in the week, I tithe everything I gain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the tax-gatherer, standing afar off, would not lift up even his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, O God, have compassion on me, the sinner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I say unto you, This [man] went down to his house justified rather than that [other]. For every one who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they brought to him also infants that he might touch them, but the disciples when they saw [it] rebuked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Jesus calling them to [him] said, Suffer little children to come to me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And a certain ruler asked him saying, Good teacher, having done what, shall I inherit eternal life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said, All these things have I kept from my youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when Jesus had heard this, he said to him, One thing is lacking to thee yet: Sell all that thou hast and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in the heavens, and come, follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But when he heard this he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, he said, How difficultly shall those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">for it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And those who heard it said, And who can be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But he said, The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Peter said, Behold, *we* have left all things and have followed thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he said to them, Verily I say to you, There is no one who has left home, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">who shall not receive manifold more at this time, and in the coming age life eternal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he took the twelve to [him] and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written of the Son of man by the prophets shall be accomplished;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they have scourged [him] they will kill him; and on the third day he will rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they understood nothing of these things. And this word was hidden from them, and they did not know what was said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And it came to pass when he came into the neighbourhood of Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And when he heard the crowd passing, he inquired what this might be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they told him that Jesus the Nazaraean was passing by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he called out saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And those [who were] going before rebuked him that he might be silent; but *he* cried out so much the more, Son of David, have mercy on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be led to him. And when he drew nigh he asked him [saying],</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I may see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Jesus said to him, See: thy faith has healed thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people when they saw [it] gave praise to God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he entered and passed through Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And behold, [there was] a man by name called Zacchaeus, and he was chief tax-gatherer, and he was rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he sought to see Jesus who he was: and he could not for the crowd, because he was little in stature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And running on before, he got up into a sycamore that he might see him, for he was going to pass that [way].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when he came up to the place, Jesus looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for to-day I must remain in thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he made haste and came down, and received him with joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And all murmured when they saw [it], saying, He has turned in to lodge with a sinful man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I return [him] fourfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jesus said to him, To-day salvation is come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But as they were listening to these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was about to be immediately manifested.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said therefore, A certain high-born man went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And having called his own ten bondmen, he gave to them ten minas, and said to them, Trade while I am coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not that this [man] should reign over us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass on his arrival back again, having received the kingdom, that he desired these bondmen to whom he gave the money to be called to him, in order that he might know what every one had gained by trading.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the first came up, saying, [My] Lord, thy mina has produced ten minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to him, Well [done], thou good bondman; because thou hast been faithful in that which is least, be thou in authority over ten cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the second came, saying, [My] Lord, thy mina has made five minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said also to this one, And *thou*, be over five cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And another came, saying, [My] Lord, lo, [there is] thy mina, which I have kept laid up in a towel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For I feared thee because thou art a harsh man: thou takest up what thou hast not laid down, and thou reapest what thou hast not sowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He says to him, Out of thy mouth will I judge thee, wicked bondman: thou knewest that *I* am a harsh man, taking up what I have not laid down and reaping what I have not sowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And why didst thou not give my money to [the] bank; and *I* should have received it, at my coming, with interest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he said to those that stood by, Take from him the mina and give [it] to him who has the ten minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For I say unto you, that to every one that has shall be given; but from him that has not, that even which he has shall be taken from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Moreover those mine enemies, who would not [have] me to reign over them, bring them here and slay [them] before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And having said these things, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it came to pass as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the mountain called [the mount] of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">saying, Go into the village over against [you], in which ye will find, on entering it, a colt tied up, on which no [child] of man ever sat at any time: loose it and lead it [here].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose [it]? thus shall ye say to him, Because the Lord has need of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they that were sent, having gone their way, found as he had said to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And as they were loosing the colt, its masters said to them, Why loose ye the colt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they said, Because the Lord has need of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they led it to Jesus; and having cast their own garments on the colt, they put Jesus on [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as he went, they strewed their clothes in the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And as he drew near, already at the descent of the mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began, rejoicing, to praise God with a loud voice for all the works of power which they had seen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">saying, Blessed the King that comes in the name of [the] Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he answering said to them, I say unto you, If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And as he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, even at least in this thy day, the things that are for thy peace: but now they are hid from thine eyes;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">for days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall make a palisaded mound about thee, and shall close thee around, and keep thee in on every side,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children in thee; and shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou knewest not the season of thy visitation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And entering into the temple, he began to cast out those that sold and bought in it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">saying to them, It is written, My house is a house of prayer, but *ye* have made it a den of robbers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And he was teaching day by day in the temple: and the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">and did not find what they could do, for all the people hung on him to hear.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and announcing the glad tidings, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and spoke to him saying, Tell us by what authority thou doest these things, or who is it who has given thee this authority?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he answering said to them, *I* also will ask you [one] thing, and tell me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The baptism of John, was it of heaven or of men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we should say, Of heaven, he will say, Why have ye not believed him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but if we should say, Of men, the whole people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they answered, they did not know whence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jesus said to them, Neither do *I* tell you by what authority I do these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he began to speak to the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen, and left the country for a long time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And in the season he sent to the husbandmen a bondman, that they might give to him of the fruit of the vineyard; but the husbandmen, having beaten him, sent [him] away empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And again he sent another bondman; but they, having beaten him also, and cast insult upon him, sent [him] away empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And again he sent a third; and they, having wounded him also, cast [him] out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: perhaps when they see him they will respect [him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; [come,] let us kill him, that the inheritance may become ours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And having cast him forth out of the vineyard, they killed [him]. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do to them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it they said, May it never be!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But he looking at them said, What then is this that is written, The stone which they that builded rejected, this has become the corner-stone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Every one falling on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the chief priests and the scribes sought the same hour to lay hands on him, and they feared the people; for they knew that he had spoken this parable of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And having watched [him], they sent out suborned persons, pretending to be just men, that they might take hold of him in [his] language, so that they might deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him saying, Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest no [man's] person, but teachest with truth the way of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But perceiving their deceit he said to them, Why do ye tempt me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Shew me a denarius. Whose image and superscription has it? And answering they said, Caesar's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said to them, Pay therefore what is Caesar's to Caesar, and what is God's to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they were not able to take hold of him in [his] expressions before the people, and, wondering at his answer, they were silent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection, coming up [to him],</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">demanded of him saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any one's brother, who has a wife, die, and he die childless, his brother shall take the wife and raise up seed to his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">There were then seven brethren: and the first, having taken a wife, died childless;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and the second [took the woman, and *he* died childless];</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and the third took her: and in like manner also the seven left no children and died;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">and last of all the woman also died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">In the resurrection therefore of which of them does she become wife, for the seven had her as wife?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus said to them, The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">but they who are counted worthy to have part in that world, and the resurrection from among [the] dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">for neither can they die any more, for they are equal to angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But that the dead rise, even Moses shewed in [the section of] the bush, when he called [the] Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">but he is not God of [the] dead but of [the] living; for all live for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And some of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For they did not dare any more to ask him anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he said to them, How do they say that the Christ is David's son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">until I put thine enemies [as] footstool of thy feet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And, as all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and who love salutations in the market-places, and first seats in the synagogues, and first places at suppers;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And as some spoke of the temple, that it was adorned with goodly stones and consecrated offerings, he said,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the feast of unleavened bread, which [is] called the passover, drew nigh,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">And going forth he went according to his custom to the mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he was at the place he said to them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and having knelt down he prayed,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="43">And an angel appeared to him from heaven strengthening him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And being in conflict he prayed more intently. And his sweat became as great drops of blood, falling down upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And rising up from his prayer, coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping from grief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And he said to them, Why sleep ye? rise up and pray that ye enter not into temptation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">As he was yet speaking, behold, a crowd, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went on before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And Jesus said to him, Judas, deliverest thou up the Son of man with a kiss?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And they who were around him, seeing what was going to follow, said [to him], Lord, shall we smite with [the] sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And a certain one from among them smote the bondman of the high priest and took off his right ear.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the whole multitude of them, rising up, led him to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they began to accuse him, saying, We have found this [man] perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Pilate demanded of him saying, Art *thou* the king of the Jews? And he answering him said, Thou sayest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, I find no guilt in this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they insisted, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee even on to here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Pilate, having heard Galilee [named], demanded if the man were a Galilaean;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and having learned that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, remitted him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in those days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Herod saw Jesus he greatly rejoiced, for he had been a long while desirous of seeing him, because of hearing many things concerning him, and he hoped to see some sign done by him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and he questioned him in many words, but *he* answered him nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the chief priests and the scribes stood and accused him violently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Herod with his troops having set him at nought and mocked him, having put a splendid robe upon him, sent him back to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Pilate and Herod became friends with one another the same day, for they had been at enmity before between themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Pilate, having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">said to them, Ye have brought to me this man as turning away the people [to rebellion], and behold, I, having examined him before you, have found nothing criminal in this man as to the things of which ye accuse him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">nor Herod either, for I remitted you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Having chastised him therefore, I will release him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">( Now he was obliged to release one for them at the feast.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But they cried out in a mass saying, Away with this [man] and release Barabbas to us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who was one who, for a certain tumult which had taken place in the city, and [for] murder, had been cast into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Pilate therefore, desirous to release Jesus, again addressed [them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But they cried out in reply saying, Crucify, crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said the third time to them, What evil then has this [man] done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will chastise him therefore and release him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But they were urgent with loud voices, begging that he might be crucified. And their voices [and those of the chief priests] prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Pilate adjudged that what they begged should take place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he released him who, for tumult and murder, had been cast into prison, whom they begged for, and Jesus he delivered up to their will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And as they led him away, they laid hold on a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, and put the cross upon him to bear it behind Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And a great multitude of the people, and of women who wailed and lamented him, followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Jesus turning round to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over me, but weep over yourselves and over your children;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">for behold, days are coming in which they will say, Blessed [are] the barren, and wombs that have not borne, and breasts that have not given suck.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">for if these things are done in the green tree, what shall take place in the dry?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now two others also, malefactors, were led with him to be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they came to the place which is called Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, the other on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And, parting out his garments, they cast lots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the people stood beholding, and the rulers also [with them] sneered, saying, He has saved others; let him save himself if this is the Christ, the chosen one of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the soldiers also made game of him, coming up offering him vinegar,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">and saying, If *thou* be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And there was also an inscription [written] over him in Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew letters: This is the King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now one of the malefactors who had been hanged spoke insultingly to him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost *thou* too not fear God, thou that art under the same judgment?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">and *we* indeed justly, for we receive the just recompense of what we have done; but this [man] has done nothing amiss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he said to Jesus, Remember me, [Lord,] when thou comest in thy kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And it was about [the] sixth hour, and there came darkness over the whole land until [the] ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple rent in the midst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Jesus, having cried with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. And having said this, he expired.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Now the centurion, seeing what took place, glorified God, saying, In very deed this man was just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And all the crowds who had come together to that sight, having seen the things that took place, returned, beating [their] breasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And all those who knew him stood afar off, the women also who had followed him from Galilee, beholding these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good man and a just</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">(this [man] had not assented to their counsel and deed), of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who also waited, [himself also,] for the kingdom of God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">he having gone to Pilate begged the body of Jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and having taken it down, wrapped it in fine linen and placed him in a tomb hewn in the rock, where no one had ever been laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And it was preparation day, and [the] sabbath twilight was coming on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And women, who had come along with him out of Galilee, having followed, saw the sepulchre and how his body was placed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And having returned they prepared aromatic spices and ointments, and remained quiet on the sabbath, according to the commandment.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But on the morrow of the sabbath, very early indeed in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the aromatic spices which they had prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when they had entered they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass as they were in perplexity about it, that behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living one among the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you, being yet in Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">saying, The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and rise the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they remembered his words;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and, returning from the sepulchre, related all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now it was Mary of Magdala, and Johanna, and Mary the [mother] of James, and the others with them, who told these things to the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And their words appeared in their eyes as an idle tale, and they disbelieved them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Peter, rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping down he sees the linen clothes lying there alone, and went away home, wondering at what had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And behold, two of them were going on the same day to a village distant sixty stadia from Jerusalem, called Emmaus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and they conversed with one another about all these things which had taken place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass as they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus himself drawing nigh, went with them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">but their eyes were holden so as not to know him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to them, What discourses are these which pass between you as ye walk, and are downcast?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And one [of them], named Cleopas, answering said to him, Thou sojournest alone in Jerusalem, and dost not know what has taken place in it in these days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazaraean, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to [the] judgment of death and crucified him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But *we* had hoped that *he* was [the one] who is about to redeem Israel. But then, besides all these things, it is now, to-day, the third day since these things took place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And withal, certain women from amongst us astonished us, having been very early at the sepulchre,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and, not having found his body, came, saying that they also had seen a vision of angels, who say that he is living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And some of those with us went to the sepulchre, and found it so, as the women also had said, but him they saw not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And *he* said to them, O senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they drew near to the village where they were going, and *he* made as though he would go farther.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And they constrained him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is declining. And he entered in to stay with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it came to pass as he was at table with them, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken it, gave it to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And their eyes were opened, and they recognised him. And he disappeared from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in us as he spoke to us on the way, [and] as he opened the scriptures to us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">saying, The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they related what [had happened] on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst, and says to them, Peace [be] unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But they, being confounded and being frightened, supposed they beheld a spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why are thoughts rising in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">behold my hands and my feet, that it is *I* myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And having said this he shewed them his hands and his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But while they yet did not believe for joy, and were wondering, he said to them, Have ye anything here to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">and he took it and ate before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he said to them, These [are] the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And *ye* are witnesses of these things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">*He* was not the light, but that he might witness concerning the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was in the world, and the world had [its] being through him, and the world knew him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came to his own, and his own received him not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">but as many as received him, to them gave he [the] right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">(John bears witness of him, and he has cried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">for of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared [him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask him, Thou, who art thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he acknowledged and denied not, and acknowledged, I am not the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, I [am] [the] voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of [the] Lord, as said Esaias the prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they were sent from among the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they asked him and said to him, Why baptisest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered them saying, I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he *was* before me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and I knew him not; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with [the] Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Again, on the morrow, there stood John and two of his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Jesus having turned, and seeing them following, says to them, What seek ye? And *they* said to him, Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He says to them, Come and see. They went therefore, and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard [this] from John and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messias (which being interpreted is Christ).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he led him to Jesus. Jesus looking at him said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee, and Jesus finds Philip, and says to him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold [one] truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And he says to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And on the third day a marriage took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jesus also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And wine being deficient, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus says to her, What have I to do with thee, woman? mine hour has not yet come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">His mother says to the servants, Whatever he may say to you, do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now there were standing there six stone water-vessels, according to the purification of the Jews, holding two or three measures each.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus says to them, Fill the water-vessels with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he says to them, Draw out now, and carry [it] to the feast-master. And they carried [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when the feast-master had tasted the water which had been made wine (and knew not whence it was, but the servants knew who drew the water), the feast-master calls the bridegroom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and says to him, Every man sets on first the good wine, and when [men] have well drunk, then the inferior; thou hast kept the good wine till now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this he descended to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he found in the temple the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and, having made a scourge of cords, he cast [them] all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the change of the money-changers, and overturned the tables,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and said to the sellers of doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">[And] his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thy house devours me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Jews therefore answered and said to him, What sign shewest thou to us, that thou doest these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple building, and thou wilt raise it up in three days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But *he* spoke of the temple of his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When therefore he was raised from among [the] dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when he was in Jerusalem, at the passover, at the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he wrought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all [men],</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But there was a man from among the Pharisees, his name Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">he came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God, for none can do these signs that thou doest unless God be with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be born being old? can he enter a second time into the womb of his mother and be born?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered and said to him, Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and we bear witness of that which we have seen, and ye receive not our witness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">that every one who believes on him may [not perish, but] have life eternal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For God has not sent his Son into the world that he may judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He that believes on him is not judged: but he that believes not has been already judged, because he has not believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the judgment, that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light; for their works were evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For every one that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light that his works may not be shewn as they are;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but he that practises the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they have been wrought in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he abode with them and baptised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And John also was baptising in Aenon, near Salim, because there was a great deal of water there; and they came to [him] and were baptised:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">for John was not yet cast into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">There was therefore a reasoning of the disciples of John with a Jew about purification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, he baptises, and all come to him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus makes and baptises more disciples than John</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(however, Jesus himself did not baptise, but his disciples),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">he left Judaea and went away again unto Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he must needs pass through Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He comes therefore to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near to the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now a fountain of Jacob's was there; Jesus therefore, being wearied with the way he had come, sat just as he was at the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">A woman comes out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus says to her, Give me to drink</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">(for his disciples had gone away into the city that they might buy provisions).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How dost thou, being a Jew, ask to drink of me who am a Samaritan woman? for Jews have no intercourse with Samaritans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The woman says to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou the living water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered and said to her, Every one who drinks of this water shall thirst again;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever, but the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The woman says to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The woman answered and said, I have not a husband. Jesus says to her, Thou hast well said, I have not a husband;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">for thou hast had five husbands, and he whom now thou hast is not thy husband: this thou hast spoken truly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The woman says to him, Sir, I see that thou art a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, [the] hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Ye worship ye know not what; we worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But [the] hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">But many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him because of the word of the woman who bore witness, He told me all things that I had ever done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When therefore the Samaritans came to him they asked him to abide with them, and he abode there two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And more a great deal believed on account of his word;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="43">But after the two days he went forth thence and went away into Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">for Jesus himself bore witness that a prophet has no honour in his own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the feast, for they also went to the feast.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="49">The courtier says to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus says to him, Go, thy son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="52">He inquired therefore from them the hour at which he got better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">The father therefore knew that [it was] in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son lives; and he believed, himself and his whole house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now there is in Jerusalem, at the sheepgate, a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In these lay a multitude of sick, blind, lame, withered, [awaiting the moving of the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For an angel descended at a certain season in the pool and troubled the water. Whoever therefore first went in after the troubling of the water became well, whatever disease he laboured under.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But there was a certain man there who had been suffering under his infirmity thirty and eight years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus seeing this [man] lying [there], and knowing that he was [in that state] now a great length of time, says to him, Wouldest thou become well?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The infirm [man] answered him, Sir, I have not a man, in order, when the water has been troubled, to cast me into the pool; but while I am coming another descends before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And immediately the man became well, and took up his couch and walked: and on that day was sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Jews therefore said to the healed [man], It is sabbath, it is not permitted thee to take up thy couch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, He that made me well, *he* said to me, Take up thy couch and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They asked him [therefore], Who is the man who said to thee, Take up thy couch and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he that had been healed knew not who it was, for Jesus had slidden away, there being a crowd in the place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art become well: sin no more, that something worse do not happen to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus [and sought to kill him], because he had done these things on sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto and I work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he had not only violated the sabbath, but also said that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father doing: for whatever things *he* does, these things also the Son does in like manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the Father loves the Son and shews him all things which he himself does; and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may wonder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For even as the Father raises the dead and quickens [them], thus the Son also quickens whom he will:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">for neither does the Father judge any one, but has given all judgment to the Son;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">that all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He who honours not the Son, honours not the Father who has sent him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he that hears my word, and believes him that has sent me, has life eternal, and does not come into judgment, but is passed out of death into life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Verily, verily, I say unto you, that an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that have heard shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and has given him authority to execute judgment [also], because he is Son of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Wonder not at this, for an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear his voice,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee, [or] of Tiberias,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there sat with his disciples:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus then, lifting up his eyes and seeing that a great crowd is coming to him, says to Philip, Whence shall we buy loaves that these may eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But this he said trying him, for he knew what he was going to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Philip answered him, Loaves for two hundred denarii are not sufficient for them, that each may have some little [portion].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fishes; but this, what is it for so many?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">[And] Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place: the men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they had been filled, he says to his disciples, Gather together the fragments which are over and above, that nothing may be lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They gathered [them] therefore together, and filled twelve hand-baskets full of fragments of the five barley loaves, which were over and above to those that had eaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The men therefore, having seen the sign which Jesus had done, said, This is truly the prophet which is coming into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus therefore knowing that they were going to come and seize him, that they might make [him] king, departed again to the mountain himself alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">The Jews therefore murmured about him, because he said, I am the bread which has come down out of heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">they say to him, Teacher, this woman has been taken in the very act, committing adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now in the law Moses has commanded us to stone such; thou therefore, what sayest thou?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore he heard, He is sick, he remained two days then in the place where he was.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews therefore who were with her in the house and consoling her, seeing Mary that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She goes to the tomb, that she may weep there.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus therefore, again deeply moved in himself, comes to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus says, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead, says to him, Lord, he stinks already, for he is four days [there].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus says to her, Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifted up his eyes on high and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="43">And having said this, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the dead came forth, bound feet and hands with graveclothes, and his face was bound round with a handkerchief. Jesus says to them, Loose him and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Many therefore of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what he had done, believed on him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many signs.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="49">But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="51">But this he did not say of himself; but, being high priest that year, prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and not for the nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">From that day therefore they took counsel that they might kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went away thence into the country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he sojourned with the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But the passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">They sought therefore Jesus, and said among themselves, standing in the temple, What do ye think? that he will not come to the feast?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">One of his disciples therefore, Judas [son] of Simon, Iscariote, who was about to deliver him up, says,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to have kept this for the day of my preparation for burial;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">for ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">The maid therefore, who was porteress, says to Peter, Art thou also of the disciples of this man? He says, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the bondmen and officers, having made a fire of coals (for it was cold), stood and warmed themselves; and Peter was standing with them and warming himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The high priest therefore demanded of Jesus concerning his disciples and concerning his doctrine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I taught always in [the] synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and in secret I have spoken nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Why demandest thou of me? Demand of those who have heard, what I have spoken to them; behold, they know what I have said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But as he said these things, one of the officers who stood by gave a blow on the face to Jesus, saying, Answerest thou the high priest thus?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Annas [then] had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, Art thou also of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">One of the bondmen of the high priest, who was kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, says, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Peter denied therefore again, and immediately [the] cock crew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They lead therefore Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium; and it was early morn. And *they* entered not into the praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but eat the passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Pilate therefore went out to them and said, What accusation do ye bring against this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They answered and said to him, If this [man] were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Pilate therefore said to them, Take him, ye, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not permitted to us to put any one to death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spoke, signifying what death he should die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium and called Jesus, and said to him, Thou art the king of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered [him], Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others said it to thee concerning me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy nation and the chief priests have delivered thee up to me: what hast thou done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought that I might not be delivered up to the Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Pilate therefore said to him, Thou art then a king? Jesus answered, Thou sayest [it], that I am a king. I have been born for this, and for this I have come into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this he went out again to the Jews, and says to them, I find no fault whatever in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But ye have a custom that I release [some] one to you at the passover; will ye therefore that I release unto you the king of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They cried therefore again all, saying, Not this [man], but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged [him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns put it on his head, and put a purple robe on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and came to him and said, Hail, king of the Jews! and gave him blows on the face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Pilate went out again and says to them, Lo, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find in him no fault whatever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">(Jesus therefore went forth without, wearing the crown of thorn, and the purple robe.) And he says to them, Behold the man!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they cried out saying, Crucify, crucify [him]. Pilate says to them, Take him ye and crucify [him], for I find no fault in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to [our] law he ought to die, because he made himself Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Pilate therefore heard this word, he was the rather afraid,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and went into the praetorium again and says to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Pilate therefore says to him, Speakest thou not to *me*? Dost thou not know that I have authority to release thee and have authority to crucify thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered, Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above. On this account he that has delivered me up to thee has [the] greater sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">From this time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews cried out saying, If thou releasest this [man], thou art not a friend to Caesar. Every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Pilate therefore, having heard these words, led Jesus out and sat down upon [the] judgment-seat, at a place called Pavement, but in Hebrew Gabbatha;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">(now it was [the] preparation of the passover; it was about the sixth hour;) and he says to the Jews, Behold your king!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Then therefore he delivered him up to them, that he might be crucified; and they took Jesus and led him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he went out, bearing his cross, to the place called [place] of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">where they crucified him, and with him two others, [one] on this side, and [one] on that, and Jesus in the middle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the cross. But there was written: Jesus the Nazaraean, the King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">This title therefore many of the Jews read, for the place of the city where Jesus was crucified was near; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, Latin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The king of the Jews, but that *he* said, I am king of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothes, and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and the body-coat; but the body-coat was seamless, woven through the whole from the top.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They said therefore to one another, Let us not rend it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled which says, They parted my garments among themselves, and on my vesture they cast lots. The soldiers therefore did these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and the sister of his mother, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus therefore, seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he says unto the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">There was a vessel therefore there full of vinegar, and having filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting hyssop round it, they put it up to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When therefore Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and having bowed his head, he delivered up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews therefore, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for it was [the] preparation, (for the day of that sabbath was a great [day],) demanded of Pilate that their legs might be broken and they taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first and of the other that had been crucified with him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">but coming to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he who saw it bears witness, and his witness is true, and he knows that he says true that ye also may believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shall be broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly through fear of the Jews, demanded of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus: and Pilate allowed it. He came therefore and took away the body of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Nicodemus also, who at first came to Jesus by night, came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds [weight].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They took therefore the body of Jesus and bound it up in linen with the spices, as it is the custom with the Jews to prepare for burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But there was in the place where he had been crucified a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and came to the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the two ran together, and the other disciple ran forward faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying; he did not however go in.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Then entered in therefore the other disciple also who came first to the tomb, and he saw and believed;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And they say to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Having said these things she turned backward and beholds Jesus standing [there], and knew not that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus says to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? Whom seekest thou? She, supposing that it was the gardener, says to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus says to her, Mary. She, turning round, says to him in Hebrew, Rabboni, which means Teacher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus says to her, Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and [to] my God and your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Mary of Magdala comes bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] he had said these things to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first [day] of the week, and the doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace [be] to you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter says to them, I go to fish. They say to him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and went on board, and that night took nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And early morn already breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; the disciples however did not know that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus therefore says to them, Children, have ye anything to eat? They answered him, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said to them, Cast the net at the right side of the ship and ye will find. They cast therefore, and they could no longer draw it, from the multitude of fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It is the Lord. Simon Peter therefore, having heard that it was the Lord, girded his overcoat [on him] (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and the other disciples came in the small boat, for they were not far from the land, but somewhere about two hundred cubits, dragging the net of fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When therefore they went out on the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus says to them, Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Simon Peter went up and drew the net to the land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there were so many, the net was not rent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus says to them, Come [and] dine. But none of the disciples dared inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them, and the fish in like manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to the disciples, being risen from among [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When therefore they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He says to him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. He says to him, Feed my lambs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He says to him again a second time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? He says to him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. He says to him, Shepherd my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He says to him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, art thou attached to me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Art thou attached to me? and said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But he said this signifying by what death he should glorify God. And having said this, he says to him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Peter, turning round, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned at supper on his breast, and said, Lord, who is it that delivers thee up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Peter, seeing him, says to Jesus, Lord, and what [of] this [man]?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus says to him, If I will that he abide until I come, what [is that] to thee? Follow thou me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">This word therefore went out among the brethren, That disciple does not die. And Jesus did not say to him, He does not die; but, If I will that he abide until I come, what [is that] to thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his witness is true.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And as Peter doubted in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold also the men who were sent by Cornelius, having sought out the house of Simon, stood at the gate,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And having found [him], he brought him to Antioch. And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd: and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now in these days prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time Herod the king laid his hands on some of those of the assembly to do them hurt,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And this she did many days. And Paul, being distressed, turned, and said to the spirit, I enjoin thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out the same hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And her masters, seeing that the hope of their gains was gone, having seized Paul and Silas, dragged [them] into the market before the magistrates;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and having brought them up to the praetors, said, These men utterly trouble our city, being Jews,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and announce customs which it is not lawful for us to receive nor practise, being Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the crowd rose up too against them; and the praetors, having torn off their clothes, commanded to scourge [them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having laid many stripes upon them they cast [them] into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and secured their feet to the stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And at midnight Paul and Silas, in praying, were praising God with singing, and the prisoners listened to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison shook, and all the doors were immediately opened, and the bonds of all loosed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the jailor being awakened out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, having drawn a sword was going to kill himself, thinking the prisoners had fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And having asked for lights, he rushed in, and, trembling, fell down before Paul and Silas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And leading them out said, Sirs, what must I do that I may be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, with all that were in his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he took them the same hour of the night and washed [them] from their stripes; and was baptised, he and all his straightway.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And having brought them into his house he laid the table [for them], and rejoiced with all his house, having believed in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when it was day, the praetors sent the lictors, saying, Let those men go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the jailor reported these words to Paul: The praetors have sent that ye may be let go. Now therefore go out and depart in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly uncondemned, us who are Romans, they have cast us into prison, and now they thrust us out secretly? no, indeed, but let them come themselves and bring us out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the lictors reported these words to the praetors. And they were afraid when they heard they were Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they came and besought them, and having brought them out, asked them to go out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And having gone out of the prison, they came to Lydia; and having seen the brethren, they exhorted them and went away.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And having journeyed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And according to Paul's custom he went in among them, and on three sabbaths reasoned with them from the scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">opening and laying down that the Christ must have suffered and risen up from among the dead, and that this is the Christ, Jesus whom *I* announce to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And some of them believed, and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, and of the Greeks who worshipped, a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the Jews having been stirred up to jealousy, and taken to [themselves] certain wicked men of the lowest rabble, and having got a crowd together, set the city in confusion; and having beset the house of Jason sought to bring them out to the people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and not having found them, dragged Jason and certain brethren before the politarchs, crying out, These [men] that have set the world in tumult, are come here also,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">whom Jason has received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying, that there is another king, Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they troubled the crowd and the politarchs when they heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And having taken security of Jason and the rest, they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the brethren immediately sent away, in the night, Paul and Silas to Berea; who, being arrived, went away into the synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, receiving the word with all readiness of mind, daily searching the scriptures if these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore many from among them believed, and of Grecian women of the upper classes and men not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the word of God was announced in Berea also by Paul, they came there also, stirring up the crowds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as to the sea; but Silas and Timotheus abode there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and, having received a commandment to Silas and Timotheus, that they should come to him as quickly as possible, they departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But in Athens, while Paul was waiting for them, his spirit was painfully excited in him seeing the city given up to idolatry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He reasoned therefore in the synagogue with the Jews, and those who worshipped, and in the market-place every day with those he met with.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers attacked him. And some said, What would this chatterer say? and some, He seems to be an announcer of foreign demons, because he announced the glad tidings of Jesus and the resurrection [to them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And having taken hold on him they brought [him] to Areopagus, saying, Might we know what this new doctrine which is spoken by thee [is]?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears. We wish therefore to know what these things may mean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now all [the] Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else than to tell and to hear the news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Paul standing in the midst of Areopagus said, Athenians, in every way I see you given up to demon worship;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">for, passing through and beholding your shrines, I found also an altar on which was inscribed, To the unknown God. Whom therefore ye reverence, not knowing [him], him I announce to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The God who has made the world and all things which are in it, *he*, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">nor is served by men's hands as needing something, himself giving to all life and breath and all things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and has made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, having determined ordained times and the boundaries of their dwelling,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">that they may seek God; if indeed they might feel after him and find him, although he is not far from each one of us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for in him we live and move and exist; as also some of the poets amongst you have said, For we are also his offspring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Being therefore [the] offspring of God, we ought not to think that which is divine to be like gold or silver or stone, [the] graven form of man's art and imagination.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">God therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, now enjoins men that they shall all everywhere repent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">because he has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by [the] man whom he has appointed, giving the proof [of it] to all [in] having raised him from among [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And when they heard [of the] resurrection of the dead, some mocked, and some said, We will hear thee again also concerning this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Thus Paul went out of their midst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But some men joining themselves to him believed; among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after these things, having left Athens, he came to Corinth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and finding a certain Jew by name Aquila, of Pontus by race, just come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, (because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome,) came to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and because they were of the same trade abode with them, and wrought. For they were tent-makers by trade.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in respect of the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But as they opposed and spoke injuriously, he shook his clothes, and said to them, Your blood be upon your own head: *I* [am] pure; from henceforth I will go to the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And departing thence he came to the house of a certain [man], by name Justus, who worshipped God, whose house adjoined the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Lord said by vision in [the] night to Paul, Fear not, but speak and be not silent;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">because *I* am with thee, and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he remained [there] a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one consent rose against Paul and led him to the judgment-seat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">saying, This [man] persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But as Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed it was some wrong or wicked criminality, O Jews, of reason I should have borne with you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but if it be questions about words, and names, and the law that ye have, see to it yourselves; [for] *I* do not intend to be judge of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he drove them from the judgment-seat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And having all laid hold on Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, they beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio troubled himself about none of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Paul, having yet stayed [there] many days, took leave of the brethren and sailed thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and he arrived at Ephesus, and left them there. But entering himself into the synagogue he reasoned with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when they asked him that he would remain for a longer time [with them] he did not accede,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but bade them farewell, saying, [I must by all means keep the coming feast at Jerusalem]; I will return to you again, if God will: and he sailed away from Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And landing at Caesarea, and having gone up and saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having stayed [there] some time, he went forth, passing in order through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, establishing all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, who was mighty in the scriptures, arrived at Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in his spirit, he spoke and taught exactly the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And *he* began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to [them] and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when he purposed to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples engaging them to receive him, who, being come, contributed much to those who believed through grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he with great force convinced the Jews publicly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper districts, came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">he said to them, Did ye receive [the] Holy Spirit when ye had believed? And they [said] to him, We did not even hear if [the] Holy Spirit was [come].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said, To what then were ye baptised? And they said, To the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Paul said, John indeed baptised [with] the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on him that was coming after him, that is, on Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when they heard that, they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Paul having laid [his] hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And all the men were about twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly during three months, reasoning and persuading [the things] concerning the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when some were hardened and disbelieved, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, he left them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this took place for two years, so that all that inhabited Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God wrought no ordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so that even napkins or aprons were brought from his body [and put] upon the sick, and the diseases left them, and the wicked spirits went out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And certain of the Jewish exorcists also, who went about, took in hand to call upon those who had wicked spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preaches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there were certain [men], seven sons of Sceva, Jewish high priest, who were doing this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the wicked spirit answering said to them, Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; but *ye*, who are ye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the man in whom the wicked spirit was leaped upon them, and having mastered both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who inhabited Ephesus, and fear fell upon all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And many of those that believed came confessing and declaring their deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And many of those that practised curious arts brought their books [of charms] and burnt them before all. And they reckoned up the prices of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thus with might the word of the Lord increased and prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, After I have been there I must see Rome also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And having sent into Macedonia two of those ministering to him, Timotheus and Erastus, he remained himself awhile in Asia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there took place at that time no small disturbance about the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For a certain [man] by name Demetrius, a silver-beater, making silver temples of Artemis, brought no small gain to the artisans;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">whom having brought together, and those who wrought in such things, he said, Men, ye know that our well-living arises from this work,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and ye see and hear that this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great crowd, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, saying that they are no gods which are made with hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now not only there is danger for us that our business come into discredit, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be counted for nothing, and that her greatness should be destroyed whom the whole of Asia and the world reveres.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And having heard [this], and being filled with rage, they cried out, saying, Great [is] Artemis of the Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the [whole] city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord to the theatre, having seized and carried off with [them] Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, fellow-travellers of Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But Paul intending to go in to the people, the disciples suffered him not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and some of the Asiarchs also, who were his friends, sent to him and urged him not to throw himself into the theatre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Different persons therefore cried out some different thing; for the assembly was tumultuous, and the most did not know for what cause they had come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But from among the crowd they put forward Alexander, the Jews pushing him forward. And Alexander, beckoning with his hand, would have made a defence to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But, recognising that he was a Jew, there was one cry from all, shouting for about two hours, Great [is] Artemis of the Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the townclerk, having quieted the crowd, said, Ephesians, what man is there then who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of Artemis the great, and of the [image] which fell down from heaven?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">These things therefore being undeniable, it is necessary that ye should be calm and do nothing headlong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For ye have brought these men, [who are] neither temple-plunderers, nor speak injuriously of your goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">If therefore Demetrius and the artisans who [are] with him have a matter against any one, the courts are being held, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if ye inquire anything concerning other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For also we are in danger to be put in accusation for sedition for this [affair] of to-day, no cause existing in reference to which we shall be able to give a reason for this concourse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But after the tumult had ceased, Paul having called the disciples to [him] and embraced [them], went away to go to Macedonia.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And having spent three months [there], a treacherous plot against him having been set on foot by the Jews, as he was going to sail to Syria, [the] resolution was adopted of returning through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater [son] of Pyrrhus, a Berean; and of Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius and Timotheus of Derbe, and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">and coming to us and taking the girdle of Paul, and having bound his own hands and feet, said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, The man whose this girdle is shall the Jews thus bind in Jerusalem, and deliver him up into the hands of [the] Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when we heard these things, both we and those of the place besought [him] not to go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Paul answered, What do ye, weeping and breaking my heart? for *I* am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he would not be persuaded, we were silent, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And after these days, having got our effects ready, we went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And [some] of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing [with them] a certain Mnason, a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we were to lodge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when we arrived at Jerusalem the brethren gladly received us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And on the morrow Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders came there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And having saluted them, he related one by one the things which God had wrought among the nations by his ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they having heard [it] glorified God, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are of the Jews who have believed, and all are zealous of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews among the nations apostasy from Moses, saying that they should not circumcise their children, nor walk in the customs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What is it then? a multitude must necessarily come together, for they will hear that thou art come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">This do therefore that we say to thee: We have four men who have a vow on them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses, that they may have their heads shaved; and all will know that [of those things] of which they have been informed about thee nothing is [true]; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But concerning [those of] the nations who have believed, we have written, deciding that they should [observe no such thing, only to] keep themselves both from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Paul, taking the men, on the next day, having been purified, entered with them into the temple, signifying the time the days of the purification would be fulfilled, until the offering was offered for every one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when the seven days were nearly completed, the Jews from Asia, having seen him in the temple, set all the crowd in a tumult, and laid hands upon him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">crying, Israelites, help! this is the man who teaches all everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place, and has brought Greeks too into the temple, and profaned this holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people; and having laid hold on Paul they drew him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And as they were seeking to kill him, a representation came to the chiliarch of the band that the whole of Jerusalem was in a tumult;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">who, taking with him immediately soldiers and centurions, ran down upon them. But they, seeing the chiliarch and the soldiers, ceased beating Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the chiliarch came up and laid hold upon him, and commanded [him] to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he might be, and what he had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And different persons cried some different thing in the crowd. But he, not being able to know the certainty on account of the uproar, commanded him to be brought into the fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But when he got upon the stairs it was so that he was borne by the soldiers on account of the violence of the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For the multitude of the people followed, crying, Away with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But as he was about to be led into the fortress, Paul says to the chiliarch, Is it allowed me to say something to thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Thou art not then that Egyptian who before these days raised a sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But Paul said, *I* am a Jew of Tarsus, citizen of no insignificant city of Cilicia, and I beseech of thee, allow me to speak to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he had allowed him, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people; and a great silence having been made, he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Brethren and fathers, hear my defence which I now make to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And hearing that he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more quiet; and he says,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">*I* am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, educated according to [the] exactness of the law of [our] fathers, being zealous for God, as *ye* are all this day;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who have persecuted this way unto death, binding and delivering up to prisons both men and women;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the elderhood: from whom also, having received letters to the brethren, I went to Damascus to bring those also who were there, bound, to Jerusalem, to be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, as I was journeying and drawing near to Damascus, that, about mid-day, there suddenly shone out of heaven a great light round about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And *I* answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, *I* am Jesus the Nazaraean, whom *thou* persecutest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But they that were with me beheld the light, [and were filled with fear], but heard not the voice of him that was speaking to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rise up, and go to Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all things which it is appointed thee to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as I could not see, through the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came to Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And a certain Ananias, a pious man according to the law, borne witness to by all the Jews who dwelt [there],</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">coming to me and standing by me, said to me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And *I*, in the same hour, received my sight and saw him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen thee beforehand to know his will, and to see the just one, and to hear a voice out of his mouth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">for thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And now why lingerest thou? Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away, calling on his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass when I had returned to Jerusalem, and as I was praying in the temple, that I became in ecstasy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and saw him saying to me, Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And *I* said, Lord, they themselves know that *I* was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue those that believe on thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and when the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed, I also myself was standing by and consenting, and kept the clothes of them who killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said to me, Go, for *I* will send thee to the nations afar off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they heard him until this word, and lifted up their voice, saying, Away with such a one as that from the earth, for it was not fit he should live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as they were crying, and throwing away their clothes, and casting dust into the air,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">the chiliarch commanded him to be brought into the fortress, saying that he should be examined by scourging, that he might ascertain for what cause they cried thus against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But as they stretched him forward with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood [by], Is it lawful for you to scourge a man [who is] a Roman and uncondemned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the centurion, having heard it, went and reported it to the chiliarch, saying, What art thou going to do? for this man is a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the chiliarch coming up said to him, Tell me, Art *thou* a Roman? And he said, Yes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the chiliarch answered, *I*, for a great sum, bought this citizenship. And Paul said, But *I* was also [free] born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Immediately therefore those who were going to examine him left him, and the chiliarch also was afraid when he ascertained that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And on the morrow, desirous to know the certainty [of the matter] why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and having brought Paul down set him before them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Paul, fixing his eyes on the council, said, Brethren, I have walked in all good conscience with God unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the high priest Ananias ordered those standing by him to smite his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Paul said to him, God will smite thee, whited wall. And *thou*, dost thou sit judging me according to the law, and breaking the law commandest me to be smitten?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And those that stood by said, Dost thou rail against the high priest of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Paul said, I was not conscious, brethren, that he was high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evilly of the ruler of thy people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Paul, knowing that the one part [of them] were of the Sadducees and the other of the Pharisees, cried out in the council, Brethren, *I* am a Pharisee, son of Pharisees: *I* am judged concerning the hope and resurrection of [the] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he had spoken this, there was a tumult of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For Sadducees say there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but Pharisees confess both of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there was a great clamour, and the scribes of the Pharisees' part rising up contended, saying, We find nothing evil in this man; and if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a great tumult having arisen, the chiliarch, fearing lest Paul should have been torn in pieces by them, commanded the troop to come down and take him by force from the midst of them, and to bring [him] into the fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the following night the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good courage; for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must bear witness at Rome also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when it was day, the Jews, having banded together, put themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they should kill Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they were more than forty who had joined together in this oath;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and they went to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have cursed ourselves with a curse to taste nothing until we kill Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore do ye with the council make a representation to the chiliarch so that he may bring him down to you, as about to determine more precisely what concerns him, and we, before he draws near, are ready to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Paul's sister's son, having heard of the lying in wait, came and entered into the fortress and reported [it] to Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Paul, having called one of the centurions, said, Take this youth to the chiliarch, for he has something to report to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He therefore, having taken him with [him], led him to the chiliarch, and says, The prisoner Paul called me to [him] and asked me to lead this youth to thee, who has something to say to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the chiliarch having taken him by the hand, and having gone apart in private, inquired, What is it that thou hast to report to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, The Jews have agreed together to make a request to thee, that thou mayest bring Paul down to-morrow into the council, as about to inquire something more precise concerning him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Do not thou then be persuaded by them, for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have put themselves under a curse neither to eat nor drink till they kill him; and now they are ready waiting the promise from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The chiliarch then dismissed the youth, commanding [him], Utter to no one that thou hast represented these things to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having called to [him] certain two of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers that they may go as far as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred light-armed footmen, for the third hour of the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And [he ordered them] to provide beasts, that they might set Paul on them and carry [him] safe through to Felix the governor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">having written a letter, couched in this form:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix, greeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This man, having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them, I came up with the military and took out [of their hands], having learned that he was a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And desiring to know the charge on which they accused him, I brought him down to their council;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">whom I found to be accused of questions of their law, but to have no charge laid against him [making him] worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But having received information of a plot about to be put in execution against the man [by the Jews], I have immediately sent him to thee, commanding also his accusers to say before thee the things that are against him. [Farewell.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The soldiers therefore, according to what was ordered them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">and on the morrow, having left the horsemen to go with him, returned to the fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And these, having entered into Caesarea, and given up the letter to the governor, presented Paul also to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And having read [it], and asked of what eparchy he was, and learned that [he was] of Cilicia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">he said, I will hear thee fully when thine accusers also are arrived. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's praetorium.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after five days came down the high priest Ananias, with the elders, and a certain orator called Tertullus, and laid their informations against Paul before the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying, Seeing we enjoy great peace through thee, and that excellent measures are executed for this nation by thy forethought,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">we receive [it] always and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But that I may not too much intrude on thy time, I beseech thee to hear us briefly in thy kindness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For finding this man a pest, and moving sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a leader of the sect of the Nazaraeans;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who also attempted to profane the temple; whom we also had seized, [and would have judged according to our law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but Lysias, the chiliarch, coming up, took [him] away with great force out of our hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">having commanded his accusers to come to thee;] of whom thou canst thyself, in examining [him], know the certainty of all these things of which we accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Jews also joined in pressing the matter against [Paul], saying that these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Paul, the governor having beckoned to him to speak, answered, Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge to this nation, I answer readily as to the things which concern myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As thou mayest know that there are not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and neither in the temple did they find me discoursing to any one, or making any tumultuous gathering together of the crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">neither can they make good the things of which they now accuse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But this I avow to thee, that in the way which they call sect, so I serve my fathers' God, believing all things which are written throughout the law, and in the prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">having hope towards God, which they themselves also receive, that there is to be a resurrection both of just and unjust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For this cause I also exercise [myself] to have in everything a conscience without offence towards God and men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And after a lapse of many years I arrived, bringing alms to my nation, and offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whereupon they found me purified in the temple, with neither crowd nor tumult. But it was certain Jews from Asia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who ought to appear before thee and accuse, if they have anything against me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">or let these themselves say what wrong they found in me when I stood before the council,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">[other] than concerning this one voice which I cried standing amongst them: I am judged this day by you touching [the] resurrection of [the] dead.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And after certain days, Felix having arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as he reasoned concerning righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment about to come, Felix, being filled with fear, answered, Go for the present, and when I get an opportunity I will send for thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">hoping at the same time that money would be given him by Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener and communed with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when two years were completed, Felix was relieved by Porcius Festus as his successor; and Felix, desirous to oblige the Jews, to acquire their favour, left Paul bound.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Festus therefore, being come into the eparchy, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the chief priests and the chief of the Jews laid informations before him against Paul, and besought him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">asking as a grace against him that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying people in wait to kill him on the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Festus therefore answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to set out shortly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let therefore the persons of authority among you, says he, going down too, if there be anything in this man, accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And having remained among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day, having sat down on the judgment-seat, commanded Paul to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he was come, the Jews who were come down from Jerusalem stood round, bringing many and grievous charges which they were not able to prove:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Paul answering for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I offended [in] anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Festus, desirous of obliging the Jews, to acquire their favour, answering Paul, said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, there to be judged before me concerning these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Paul said, I am standing before the judgment-seat of Caesar, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews have I done no wrong, as *thou* also very well knowest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If then I have done any wrong and committed anything worthy of death, I do not deprecate dying; but if there is nothing of those things of which they accuse me, no man can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Festus, having conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed to Caesar. To Caesar shalt thou go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when certain days had elapsed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to salute Festus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they had spent many days there, Festus laid before the king the matters relating to Paul, saying, There is a certain man left prisoner by Felix,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">concerning whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid informations, requiring judgment against him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to whom I answered, It is not [the] custom of the Romans to give up any man before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and he have got opportunity of defence touching the charge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When therefore they had come together here, without putting it off, I sat the next day on the judgment-seat and commanded the man to be brought:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">concerning whom the accusers, standing up, brought no such accusation of guilt as *I* supposed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but had against him certain questions of their own system of worship, and concerning a certain Jesus who is dead, whom Paul affirmed to be living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And as I myself was at a loss as to an inquiry into these things, I said, Was he willing to go to Jerusalem and there to be judged concerning these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Paul having appealed to be kept for the cognisance of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I shall send him to Caesar.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">On the morrow therefore, Agrippa being come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and having entered into the hall of audience, with the chiliarchs and the men of distinction of the city, and Festus having given command, Paul was brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye see this person, concerning whom all the multitude of the Jews applied to me both in Jerusalem and here, crying out against [him] that he ought not to live any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I, having found that he had done nothing worthy of death, and this [man] himself having appealed to Augustus, I have decided to send him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">concerning whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord. Wherefore I have brought him before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, so that an examination having been gone into I may have something to write:</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching out his hand answered in his defence:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but have, first to those both in Damascus and Jerusalem, and to all the region of Judaea, and to the nations, announced that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">On account of these things the Jews, having seized me in the temple, attempted to lay hands on and destroy me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Having therefore met with [the] help which is from God, I have stood firm unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing else than those things which both the prophets and Moses have said should happen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">[namely,] whether Christ should suffer; whether he first, through resurrection of [the] dead, should announce light both to the people and to the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And as he answered for his defence with these things, Festus says with a loud voice, Thou art mad, Paul; much learning turns thee to madness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Paul said, I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but utter words of truth and soberness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for the king is informed about these things, to whom also I speak with all freedom. For I am persuaded that of these things nothing is hidden from him; for this was not done in a corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Agrippa [said] to Paul, In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Paul [said], I would to God, both in little and in much, that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day, should become such as *I* also am, except these bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the king stood up, and the governor and Bernice, and those who sat with them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and having gone apart, they spoke to one another saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been let go if he had not appealed to Caesar.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But when it had been determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered up Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion, by name Julius, of Augustus' company.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And going on board a ship of Adramyttium about to navigate by the places along Asia, we set sail, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the next day we arrived at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and suffered him to go to his friends and refresh himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And setting sail thence we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And having sailed over the waters of Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to Myra in Lycia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy, he made us go on board her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And sailing slowly for many days, and having with difficulty got abreast of Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete abreast of Salmone;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and coasting it with difficulty we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near to which was [the] city of Lasaea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And much time having now been spent, and navigation being already dangerous, because the fast also was already past, Paul counselled them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">saying, Men, I perceive that the navigation will be with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the centurion believed rather the helmsman and the shipowner than what was said by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the harbour being ill adapted to winter in, the most counselled to set sail thence, if perhaps they might reach Phoenice to winter in, a port of Crete looking north-east and south-east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And [the] south wind blowing gently, supposing that they had gained their object, having weighed anchor they sailed close in shore along Crete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But not long after there came down it a hurricane called Euroclydon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the ship being caught and driven, and not able to bring her head to the wind, letting her go we were driven [before it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But running under the lee of a certain island called Clauda, we were with difficulty able to make ourselves masters of the boat;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">which having hoisted up, they used helps, frapping the ship; and fearing lest they should run into Syrtis and run aground, and having lowered the gear they were so driven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the storm being extremely violent on us, on the next day they threw cargo overboard,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and on the third day with their own hands they cast away the ship furniture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and no small storm lying on us, in the end all hope of our being saved was taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when they had been a long while without taking food, Paul then standing up in the midst of them said, Ye ought, O men, to have hearkened to me, and not have made sail from Crete and have gained this disaster and loss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now I exhort you to be of good courage, for there shall be no loss at all of life of [any] of you, only of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For an angel of the God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood by me this night,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted to thee all those that sail with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Wherefore be of good courage, men, for I believe God that thus it shall be, as it has been said to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But we must be cast ashore on a certain island.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when the fourteenth night was come, we being driven about in Adria, towards the middle of the night the sailors supposed that some land neared them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and having sounded found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther and having again sounded they found fifteen fathoms;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and fearing lest we should be cast on rocky places, casting four anchors out of the stern, they wished that day were come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But the sailors wishing to flee out of the ship, and having let down the boat into the sea under pretext of being about to carry out anchors from the prow,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these abide in the ship *ye* cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and let her fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And while it was drawing on to daylight, Paul exhorted them all to partake of food, saying, Ye have passed the fourteenth day watching in expectation without taking food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Wherefore I exhort you to partake of food, for this has to do with your safety; for not a hair from the head of any one of you shall perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And, having said these things and taken a loaf, he gave thanks to God before all, and having broken it began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And all taking courage, themselves also took food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And we were in the ship, all the souls, two hundred and seventy-six.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And having satisfied themselves with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when it was day they did not recognise the land; but they perceived a certain bay having a strand, on which they were minded, if they should be able, to run the ship ashore;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and, having cast off the anchors, they left [them] in the sea, at the same time loosening the lashings of the rudders, and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the strand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground, and the prow having stuck itself fast remained unmoved, but the stern was broken by the force of the waves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And [the] counsel of the soldiers was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim off and escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the centurion, desirous of saving Paul, hindered them of their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim, casting themselves first [into the sea], to get out on land;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and the rest, some on boards, some on some of the things [that came] from the ship; and thus it came to pass that all got safe to land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when we got safe [to land] we then knew that the island was called Melita.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the barbarians shewed us no common kindness; for, having kindled a fire, they took us all in because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Paul having gathered a [certain] quantity of sticks together in a bundle and laid [it] on the fire, a viper coming out from the heat seized his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said to one another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom, [though] saved out of the sea, Nemesis has not allowed to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">*He* however, having shaken off the beast into the fire, felt no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But *they* expected that he would have swollen or fallen down suddenly dead. But when they had expected a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, changing their opinion, they said he was a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now in the country surrounding that place were the lands belonging to the chief man of the island, by name Publius, who received us and gave [us] hospitality three days in a very friendly way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it happened that the father of Publius lay ill of fever and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and having prayed and laid his hands on him cured him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But this having taken place, the rest also who had sicknesses in the island came and were healed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">who also honoured us with many honours, and on our leaving they made presents to us of what should minister to our wants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And after three months we sailed in a ship which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian, with [the] Dioscuri for its ensign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And having come to Syracuse we remained three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Whence, going in a circuitous course, we arrived at Rhegium; and after one day, the wind having changed to south, on the second day we came to Puteoli,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">where, having found brethren, we were begged to stay with them seven days. And thus we went to Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And thence the brethren, having heard about us, came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Tres Tabernae, whom when Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when we came to Rome, [the centurion delivered up the prisoners to the praetorian prefect, but] Paul was allowed to remain by himself with the soldier who kept him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass after three days, that he called together those who were the chief of the Jews; and when they had come together he said to them, Brethren, *I* having done nothing against the people or the customs of our forefathers, have been delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">who having examined me were minded to let me go, because there was nothing worthy of death in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But the Jews speaking against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not as having anything to accuse my nation of.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For this cause therefore I have called you to [me] to see and to speak to you; for on account of the hope of Israel I have this chain about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they said to him, For our part, we have neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor has any one of the brethren who has arrived reported or said anything evil concerning thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But we beg to hear of thee what thou thinkest, for as concerning this sect it is known to us that it is everywhere spoken against.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having appointed him a day many came to him to the lodging, to whom he expounded, testifying of the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from early morning to evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And some were persuaded of the things which were said, but some disbelieved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And being disagreed among themselves they left; Paul having spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Spirit through Esaias the prophet to our fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear and not understand, and seeing ye shall see and not perceive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the heart of this people has become fat, and they hear heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Be it known to you therefore, that this salvation of God has been sent to the nations; *they* also will hear [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">[And he having said this, the Jews went away, having great reasoning among themselves.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he remained two whole years in his own hired lodging, and received all who came to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom unhinderedly.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, bondman of Jesus Christ, [a] called apostle, separated to God's glad tidings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(which he had before promised by his prophets in holy writings,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">concerning his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">marked out Son of God in power, according to [the] Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of [the] dead) Jesus Christ our Lord;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">by whom we have received grace and apostleship in behalf of his name, for obedience of faith among all the nations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">among whom are *ye* also [the] called of Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and [our] Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">always beseeching at my prayers, if any way now at least I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I greatly desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to establish you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that is, to have mutual comfort among you, each by the faith [which is] in the other, both yours and mine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that I often proposed to come to you, (and have been hindered until the present time,) that I might have some fruit among you too, even as among the other nations also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am a debtor both to Greeks and barbarians, both to wise and unintelligent:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">so, as far as depends on me, am I ready to announce the glad tidings to you also who [are] in Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For I am not ashamed of the glad tidings; for it is God's power to salvation, to every one that believes, both to Jew first and to Greek:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for righteousness of God is revealed therein, on the principle of faith, to faith: according as it is written, But the just shall live by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there is revealed wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety, and unrighteousness of men holding the truth in unrighteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Because what is known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested [it] to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">for from [the] world's creation the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity, so as to render them inexcusable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Because, knowing God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but fell into folly in their thoughts, and their heart without understanding was darkened:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into [the] likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and quadrupeds and reptiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Wherefore God gave them up [also] in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies between themselves:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">who changed the truth of God into falsehood, and honoured and served the creature more than him who had created [it], who is blessed for ever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For this reason God gave them up to vile lusts; for both their females changed the natural use into that contrary to nature;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and in like manner the males also, leaving the natural use of the female, were inflamed in their lust towards one another; males with males working shame, and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was fit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And according as they did not think good to have God in [their] knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind to practise unseemly things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil dispositions; whisperers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">back-biters, hateful to God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">void of understanding, faithless, without natural affection, unmerciful;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And thinkest thou this, O man, who judgest those that do such things, and practisest them [thyself], that *thou* shalt escape the judgment of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to repentance?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but, according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up to thyself wrath, in [the] day of wrath and revelation of [the] righteous judgment of God,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">to them who, in patient continuance of good works, seek for glory and honour and incorruptibility, life eternal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But to those that are contentious, and are disobedient to the truth, but obey unrighteousness, [there shall be] wrath and indignation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">tribulation and distress, on every soul of man that works evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">but glory and honour and peace to every one that works good, both to Jew first and to Greek:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">for there is no acceptance of persons with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For as many as have sinned without law shall perish also without law; and as many as have sinned under law shall be judged by law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">(for not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For when [those of the] nations, which have no law, practise by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law to themselves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or else excusing themselves between themselves;)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">thou who boastest in law, dost thou by transgression of the law dishonour God?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">For circumcision indeed profits if thou keep [the] law; but if thou be a law-transgressor, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If therefore the uncircumcision keep the requirements of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and uncircumcision by nature, fulfilling the law, judge thee, who, with letter and circumcision, [art] a law-transgressor?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he is not a Jew who [is] one outwardly, neither that circumcision which is outward in flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">but he [is] a Jew [who is so] inwardly; and circumcision, of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What then [is] the superiority of the Jew? or what the profit of circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Much every way: and first, indeed, that to them were entrusted the oracles of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what? if some have not believed, shall their unbelief make the faith of God of none effect?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Far be the thought: but let God be true, and every man false; according as it is written, So that thou shouldest be justified in thy words, and shouldest overcome when thou art in judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if our unrighteousness commend God's righteousness, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak according to man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Far be the thought: since how shall God judge the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if the truth of God, in my lie, has more abounded to his glory, why yet am *I* also judged as a sinner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and not, according as we are injuriously charged, and according as some affirm that we say, Let us practise evil things, that good ones may come? whose judgment is just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What then? are we better? No, in no wise: for we have before charged both Jews and Greeks with being all under sin:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">according as it is written, There is not a righteous [man], not even one;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">there is not the [man] that understands, there is not one that seeks after God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All have gone out of the way, they have together become unprofitable; there is not one that practises goodness, there is not so much as one:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; asps' poison [is] under their lips:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">there is no fear of God before their eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now we know that whatever the things the law says, it speaks to those under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be under judgment to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wherefore by works of law no flesh shall be justified before him; for by law [is] knowledge of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But now without law righteousness of God is manifested, borne witness to by the law and the prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ towards all, and upon all those who believe: for there is no difference;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which [is] in Christ Jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood, for [the] shewing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But what says it? The word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from among [the] dead, thou shalt be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For with [the] heart is believed to righteousness; and with [the] mouth confession made to salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the scripture says, No one believing on him shall be ashamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For there is no difference of Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all [is] rich towards all that call upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For every one whosoever, who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">How then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without one who preaches?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">But they have not all obeyed the glad tidings. For Esaias says, Lord, who has believed our report?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So faith then [is] by a report, but the report by God's word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But I say, Have they not heard? Yea, surely, Their voice has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the extremities of the habitable world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I say, Has not Israel known? First, Moses says, *I* will provoke you to jealousy through [them that are] not a nation: through a nation without understanding I will anger you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Esaias is very bold, and says, I have been found by those not seeking me; I have become manifest to those not inquiring after me.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I say then, Has God cast away his people? Far be the thought. For *I* also am an Israelite, of [the] seed of Abraham, of [the] tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God has not cast away his people whom he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture says in [the history of] Elias, how he pleads with God against Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have dug down thine altars; and *I* have been left alone, and they seek my life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But what says the divine answer to him? I have left to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed knee to Baal.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">I say then, Have they stumbled in order that they might fall? Far be the thought: but by their fall [there is] salvation to the nations to provoke them to jealousy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But if their fall [be the] world's wealth, and their loss [the] wealth of [the] nations, how much rather their fulness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I speak to you, the nations, inasmuch as *I* am apostle of nations, I glorify my ministry;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">if by any means I shall provoke to jealousy [them which are] my flesh, and shall save some from among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For if their casting away [be the] world's reconciliation, what [their] reception but life from among [the] dead?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Thou wilt say then, The branches have been broken out in order that *I* might be grafted in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Right: they have been broken out through unbelief, and *thou* standest through faith. Be not high-minded, but fear:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">if God indeed has not spared the natural branches; lest it might be he spare not thee either.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Behold then [the] goodness and severity of God: upon them who have fallen, severity; upon thee goodness of God, if thou shalt abide in goodness, since [otherwise] *thou* also wilt be cut away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And *they* too, if they abide not in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able again to graft them in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For if *thou* hast been cut out of the olive tree wild by nature, and, contrary to nature, hast been grafted into the good olive tree, how much rather shall they, who are according to nature be grafted into their own olive tree?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, that ye may not be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the nations be come in;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">so these also have now not believed in your mercy, in order that *they* also may be objects of mercy.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">For consider your calling, brethren, that [there are] not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many high-born.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">Fool; what *thou* sowest is not quickened unless it die.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="42">Thus also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, as to our tribulation which happened [to us] in Asia, that we were excessively pressed beyond [our] power, so as to despair even of living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">ye also labouring together by supplication for us that the gift towards us, through means of many persons, may be the subject of the thanksgiving of many for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity before God, (not in fleshly wisdom but in God's grace,) we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly towards you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For we do not write other things to you but what ye well know and recognise; and I hope that ye will recognise to the end,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">But if any one has grieved, he has grieved, not me, but in part (that I may not overcharge [you]) all of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sufficient to such a one [is] this rebuke which [has been inflicted] by the many;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">to the one an odour from death unto death, but to the others an odour from life unto life; and who [is] sufficient for these things?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">who has also made us competent, [as] ministers of [the] new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">(But if the ministry of death, in letters, graven in stones, began with glory, so that the children of Israel could not fix their eyes on the face of Moses, on account of the glory of his face, [a glory] which is annulled;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">how shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit subsist in glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if the ministry of condemnation [be] glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For also that [which was] glorified is not glorified in this respect, on account of the surpassing glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if that annulled [was introduced] with glory, much rather that which abides [subsists] in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Having therefore such hope, we use much boldness:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God's fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Receive us: we have injured no one, we have ruined no one, we have made gain of no one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I do not speak for condemnation, for I have already said that ye are in our hearts, to die together, and live together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Great [is] my boldness towards you, great my exulting in respect of you; I am filled with encouragement; I overabound in joy under all our affliction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For indeed, when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but [we were] afflicted in every way; without combats, within fears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he who encourages those that are [brought] low, [even] God, encouraged us by the coming of Titus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and not by his coming only, but also through the encouragement with which he was encouraged as to you; relating to us your ardent desire, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I the more rejoiced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if also I grieved you in the letter, I do not regret [it], if even I have regretted it; for I see that that letter, if even [it were] only for a time, grieved you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now I rejoice, not that ye have been grieved, but that ye have been grieved to repentance; for ye have been grieved according to God, that in nothing ye might be injured by us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For grief according to God works repentance to salvation, never to be regretted; but the grief of the world works death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For, behold, this same thing, your being grieved according to God, how much diligence it wrought in *you*, but [what] excusing [of yourselves], but [what] indignation, but [what] fear, but [what] ardent desire, but [what] zeal, but [what] vengeance: in every way ye have proved yourselves to be pure in the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then, if also I wrote to you, [it was] not for the sake of him that injured, nor for the sake of him that was injured, but for the sake of our diligent zeal for you being manifested to you before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For this reason we have been encouraged. And we the rather rejoiced in our encouragement more abundantly by reason of the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Because if I boasted to him anything about you, I have not been put to shame; but as we have spoken to you all things in truth, so also our boasting to Titus has been [the] truth;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God bestowed in the assemblies of Macedonia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty has abounded to the riches of their [free-hearted] liberality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For according to [their] power, I bear witness, and beyond [their] power, [they were] willing of their own accord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">begging of us with much entreaty [to give effect to] the grace and fellowship of the service which [was to be rendered] to the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And not according as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us by God's will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So that we begged Titus that, according as he had before begun, so he would also complete as to you this grace also;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but even as ye abound in every way, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in love from you to us, that ye may abound in this grace also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I do not speak as commanding [it], but through the zeal of others, and proving the genuineness of your love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sakes he, being rich, became poor, in order that *ye* by *his* poverty might be enriched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I give [my] opinion in this, for this is profitable for you who began before, not only to do, but also to be willing, a year ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But now also complete the doing of it; so that as [there was] the readiness to be willing, so also to complete out of what ye have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For if the readiness be there, [a man is] accepted according to what he may have, not according to what he has not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For [it is] not in order that there may be ease for others, and for you distress,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">But thanks [be] to God, who gives the same diligent zeal for you in the heart of Titus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he received indeed the entreaty, but, being full of zeal, he went of his own accord to you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">but we have sent with him the brother whose praise [is] in the glad tidings through all the assemblies;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">For concerning the ministration which [is] for the saints, it is superfluous my writing to you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">lest haply, if Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, *we*, that we say not *ye*, may be put to shame in this confidence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I thought it necessary therefore to beg the brethren that they would come to you, and complete beforehand your fore-announced blessing, that this may be ready thus as blessing, and not as got out of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But this [is true], he that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that sows in [the spirit of] blessing shall reap also in blessing:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">each according as he is purposed in his heart; not grievingly, or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But God is able to make every gracious gift abound towards you, that, having in every way always all-sufficiency, ye may abound to every good work:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">according as it is written, He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor, his righteousness remains for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now he that supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating shall supply and make abundant your sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Because the ministration of this service is not only filling up the measure of what is lacking to the saints, but also abounding by many thanksgivings to God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">they glorifying God through the proof of this ministration, by reason of your subjection, by profession, to the glad tidings of the Christ, and your free-hearted liberality in communicating towards them and towards all;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">(but neither was Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and [it was] on account of the false brethren brought in surreptitiously, who came in surreptitiously to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that the truth of the glad tidings might remain with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But from those who were conspicuous as being somewhat whatsoever they were, it makes no difference to me: God does not accept man's person; for to me those who were conspicuous communicated nothing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but, on the contrary, seeing that the glad tidings of the uncircumcision were confided to me, even as to Peter that of the circumcision,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">(for he that wrought in Peter for [the] apostleship of the circumcision wrought also in me towards the Gentiles,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and recognising the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were conspicuous as being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas [the] right hands of fellowship, that *we* [should go] to the nations, and *they* to the circumcision;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">only that we should remember the poor, which same thing also I was diligent to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to [the] face, because he was to be condemned:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">for before that certain came from James, he ate with [those of] the nations; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those of [the] circumcision;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and the rest of the Jews also played the same dissembling part with him; so that even Barnabas was carried away too by their dissimulation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when I saw that they do not walk straightforwardly, according to the truth of the glad tidings, I said to Peter before all, If *thou*, being a Jew, livest as the nations and not as the Jews, how dost thou compel the nations to Judaize?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We, Jews by nature, and not sinners of [the] nations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">but knowing that a man is not justified on the principle of works of law [nor] but by the faith of Jesus Christ, *we* also have believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified on the principle of [the] faith of Christ; and not of works of law; because on the principle of works of law no flesh shall be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now if in seeking to be justified in Christ we also have been found sinners, then [is] Christ minister of sin? Far be the thought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if the things I have thrown down, these I build again, I constitute myself a transgressor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For *I*, through law, have died to law, that I may live to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, *I*, but Christ lives in me; but [in] that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">For if the inheritance [be] on the principle of law, [it is] no longer on the principle of promise; but God gave it in grace to Abraham by promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Why then the law? It was added for the sake of transgressions, until the seed came to whom the promise was made, ordained through angels in [the] hand of a mediator.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But a mediator is not of one, but God is one.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which [is] now, for she is in bondage with her children;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">but the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break out and cry, thou that travailest not; because the children of the desolate are more numerous than [those] of her that has a husband.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">For every house is built by some one; but he who has built all things [is] God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Moses indeed [was] faithful in all his house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken after;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but Christ, as Son over his house, whose house are *we*, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear his voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">where your fathers tempted [me], by proving [me], and saw my works forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Wherefore I was wroth with this generation, and said, They always err in heart; and *they* have not known my ways;</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have failed [of it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For indeed we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also; but the word of the report did not profit *them*, not being mixed with faith in those who heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we enter into the rest who have believed; as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest; although the works had been completed from [the] foundation of [the] world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For he has said somewhere of the seventh [day] thus, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and in this again, If they shall enter into my rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Seeing therefore it remains that some enter into it, and those who first received the glad tidings did not enter in on account of not hearkening to the word,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">again he determines a certain day, saying, in David, 'To-day,' after so long a time; (according as it has been said before), To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if Jesus had brought them into rest, he would not have spoken afterwards about another day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There remains then a sabbatism to the people of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he that has entered into his rest, he also has rested from his works, as God did from his own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let us therefore use diligence to enter into that rest, that no one may fall after the same example of not hearkening to the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the word of God [is] living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to [the] division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of [the] heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things [are] naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For every high priest taken from amongst men is established for men in things relating to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">being able to exercise forbearance towards the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is clothed with infirmity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and, on account of this [infirmity], he ought, even as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And no one takes the honour to himself but [as] called by God, even as Aaron also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Thus the Christ also has not glorified himself to be made a high priest; but he who had said to him, *Thou* art my Son, *I* have to-day begotten thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Even as also in another [place] he says, *Thou* [art] a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save him out of death, with strong crying and tears; (and having been heard because of his piety;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">though he were Son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and having been perfected, became to all them that obey him, author of eternal salvation;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Concerning whom we have much to say, and hard to be interpreted in speaking [of it], since ye are become dull in hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have again need that [one] should teach you what [are] the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk, [and] not of solid food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For every one that partakes of milk [is] unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but solid food belongs to full-grown men, who, on account of habit, have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us go on [to what belongs] to full growth, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">and this will we do if God permit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of [the] Holy Spirit,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">and have fallen away, crucifying for themselves [as they do] the Son of God, and making a show of [him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it, and produces useful herbs for those for whose sakes also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience have been inheritors of the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For God, having promised to Abraham, since he had no greater to swear by, swore by himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and thus, having had long patience, he got the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For men indeed swear by a greater, and with them the oath is a term to all dispute, as making matters sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Wherein God, willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that by two unchangeable things, in which [it was] impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">which we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from smiting the kings, and blessed him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to whom Abraham gave also the tenth portion of all; first being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now consider how great this [personage] was, to whom [even] the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they indeed from among the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is from their brethren, though these are come out of the loins of Abraham:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but he who has no genealogy from them has tithed Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But beyond all gainsaying, the inferior is blessed by the better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And here dying men receive tithes; but there [one] of whom the witness is that he lives;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, who received tithes, has been made to pay tithes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If indeed then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for the people had their law given to them in connexion with *it*, what need [was there] still that a different priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be named after the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For, the priesthood being changed, there takes place of necessity a change of law also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For he, of whom these things are said, belongs to a different tribe, of which no one has [ever] been attached to the service of the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is clear that our Lord has sprung out of Juda, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing as to priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it is yet more abundantly evident, since a different priest arises according to the similitude of Melchisedec,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who has been constituted not according to law of fleshly commandment, but according to power of indissoluble life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For it is borne witness, *Thou* art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there is a setting aside of the commandment going before for its weakness and unprofitableness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(for the law perfected nothing,) and the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And by how much [it was] not without the swearing of an oath;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(for they are become priests without the swearing of an oath, but he with the swearing of an oath, by him who said, as to him, The Lord has sworn, and will not repent [of it], *Thou* [art] priest for ever [according to the order of Melchisedec];)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">by so much Jesus became surety of a better covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they have been many priests, on account of being hindered from continuing by death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but he, because of his continuing for ever, has the priesthood unchangeable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Whence also he is able to save completely those who approach by him to God, always living to intercede for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">who has not day by day need, as the high priests, first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins, then [for] those of the people; for this he did once for all [in] having offered up himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the law constitutes men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the swearing of the oath which [is] after the law, a Son perfected for ever.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now a summary of the things of which we are speaking [is], We have such a one high priest who has sat down on [the] right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, [and] not man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For every high priest is constituted for the offering both of gifts and sacrifices; whence it is needful that this one also should have something which he may offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If then indeed he were upon earth, he would not even be a priest, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">(who serve the representation and shadow of heavenly things, according as Moses was oracularly told [when] about to make the tabernacle; for See, saith He, that thou make all things according to the pattern which has been shewn to thee in the mountain.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now he has got a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is mediator of a better covenant, which is established on the footing of better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if that first was faultless, place had not been sought for a second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For finding fault, he says to them, Behold, days come, saith the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant as regards the house of Israel, and as regards the house of Juda;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers in [the] day of my taking their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because *they* did not continue in my covenant, and *I* did not regard them, saith [the] Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Because this [is] the covenant that I will covenant to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: Giving my laws into their mind, I will write them also upon their hearts; and I will be to them for God, and *they* shall be to me for people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they shall not teach each his fellow-citizen, and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; because all shall know me in themselves, from [the] little one [among them] unto [the] great among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Because I will be merciful to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In that he says New, he has made the first old; but that which grows old and aged [is] near disappearing.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The first therefore also indeed had ordinances of service, and the sanctuary, a worldly one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For a tabernacle was set up; the first, in which [were] both the candlestick and the table and the exposition of the loaves, which is called Holy;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but after the second veil a tabernacle which is called Holy of holies,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, covered round in every part with gold, in which [were] the golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tables of the covenant;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and above over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat; concerning which it is not now [the time] to speak in detail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times, accomplishing the services;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but into the second, the high priest only, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">the Holy Spirit shewing this, that the way of the [holy of] holies has not yet been made manifest while as yet the first tabernacle has [its] standing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">the which [is] an image for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices, unable to perfect as to conscience him that worshipped, are offered,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">[consisting] only of meats and drinks and divers washings, ordinances of flesh, imposed until [the] time of setting things right.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">nor by blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, has entered in once for all into the [holy of] holies, having found an eternal redemption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of goats and bulls, and a heifer's ashes sprinkling the defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">how much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship [the] living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And for this reason he is mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">(For where [there is] a testament, the death of the testator must needs come in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For a testament [is] of force when men are dead, since it is in no way of force while the testator is alive.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whence neither the first was inaugurated without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For every commandment having been spoken according to [the] law by Moses to all the people; having taken the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, This [is] the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the tabernacle too and all the vessels of service he sprinkled in like manner with blood;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and almost all things are purified with blood according to the law, and without blood-shedding there is no remission.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">[It was] necessary then that the figurative representations of the things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices better than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For the Christ is not entered into holy places made with hand, figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">nor in order that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with blood not his own;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">since he had [then] been obliged often to suffer from the foundation of the world. But now once in the consummation of the ages he has been manifested for [the] putting away of sin by his sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And forasmuch as it is the portion of men once to die, and after this judgment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">thus the Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear to those that look for him the second time without sin for salvation.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For the law, having a shadow of the coming good things, not the image itself of the things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually yearly, perfect those who approach.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But in these [there is] a calling to mind of sins yearly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For blood of bulls and goats [is] incapable of taking away sins.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">knowing this first, that there shall come at [the] close of the days mockers with mocking, walking according to their own lusts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for from the time the fathers fell asleep all things remain thus from [the] beginning of [the] creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For this is hidden from them through their own wilfulness, that heavens were of old, and an earth, having its subsistence out of water and in water, by the word of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">through which [waters] the then world, deluged with water, perished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the present heavens and the earth by his word are laid up in store, kept for fire unto a day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But let not this one thing be hidden from you, beloved, that one day with [the] Lord [is] as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">[The] Lord does not delay his promise, as some account of delay, but is longsuffering towards you, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the day of [the] Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a rushing noise, and [the] elements, burning with heat, shall be dissolved, and [the] earth and the works in it shall be burnt up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All these things then being to be dissolved, what ought ye to be in holy conversation and godliness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, by reason of which [the] heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and [the] elements, burning with heat, shall melt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But, according to his promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Wherefore, beloved, as ye wait for these things, be diligent to be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and account the longsuffering of our Lord [to be] salvation; according as our beloved brother Paul also has written to you according to the wisdom given to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">as also in all [his] epistles, speaking in them of these things; among which some things are hard to be understood, which the untaught and ill-established wrest, as also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">*Ye* therefore, beloved, knowing [these] things before, take care lest, being led away along with the error of the wicked, ye should fall from your own stedfastness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">but grow in grace, and in [the] knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him [be] glory both now and to [the] day of eternity. Amen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">because all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her fornication; and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have been enriched through the might of her luxury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I heard another voice out of the heaven saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye have not fellowship in her sins, and that ye do not receive of her plagues:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for her sins have been heaped on one another up to the heaven, and God has remembered her unrighteousnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Recompense her even as she has recompensed; and double [to her] double, according to her works. In the cup which she has mixed, mix to her double.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So much as she has glorified herself and lived luxuriously, so much torment and grief give to her. Because she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and I am not a widow; and I shall in no wise see grief:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">for this reason in one day shall her plagues come, death and grief and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire; for strong [is the] Lord God who has judged her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication, and lived luxuriously with her, shall weep and wail over her, when they see the smoke of her burning,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">standing afar off, through fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! for in one hour thy judgment is come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the merchants of the earth weep and grieve over her, because no one buys their lading any more;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">lading of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet dye, and all thyine wood, and every article in ivory, and every article in most precious wood, and in brass, and in iron, and in marble,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and cinnamon, and amomum, and incense, and unguent, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots, and of bodies, and souls of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the ripe fruits which were the lust of thy soul have departed from thee, and all fair and splendid things have perished from thee, and they shall not find them any more at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The merchants of these things, who had been enriched through her, shall stand afar off through fear of her torment, weeping and grieving,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">saying, Woe, woe, the great city, which [was] clothed with fine linen and purple and scarlet, and had ornaments of gold and precious stones and pearls!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for in one hour so great riches has been made desolate. And every steersman, and every one who sailed to any place, and sailors, and all who exercise their calling on the sea, stood afar off,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and cried, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What [city] is like to the great city?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and cast dust upon their heads, and cried, weeping and grieving, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, in which all that had ships in the sea were enriched through her costliness! for in one hour she has been made desolate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Rejoice over her, heaven, and [ye] saints and apostles and prophets; for God has judged your judgment upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And a strong angel took up a stone, as a great millstone, and cast [it] into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall Babylon the great city be cast down, and shall be found no more at all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and voice of harp-singers and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters shall not be heard any more at all in thee, and no artificer of any art shall be found any more at all in thee, and voice of millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and light of lamp shall shine no more at all in thee, and voice of bridegroom and bride shall be heard no more at all in thee; for thy merchants were the great ones of the earth; for by thy sorcery have all the nations been deceived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And in her was found [the] blood of prophets and saints, and of all the slain upon the earth.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things I heard as a loud voice of a great multitude in the heaven, saying, Hallelujah: the salvation and the glory and the power of our God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">for true and righteous [are] his judgments; for he has judged the great harlot which corrupted the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his bondmen at her hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And a second time they said, Hallelujah. And her smoke goes up to the ages of ages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and did homage to God who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his bondmen, [and] ye that fear him, small and great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I heard as a voice of a great crowd, and as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of strong thunders, saying, Hallelujah, for [the] Lord our God the Almighty has taken to himself kingly power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Let us rejoice and exult, and give him glory; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright [and] pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he says to me, Write, Blessed [are] they who are called to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb. And he says to me, These are the true words of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I fell before his feet to do him homage. And he says to me, See [thou do it] not. I am thy fellow-bondman, and [the fellow-bondman] of thy brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Do homage to God. For the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come, gather yourselves to the great supper of God,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And the beast was taken, and the false prophet that [was] with him, who wrought the signs before him by which he deceived them that received the mark of the beast, and those that worship his image. Alive were both cast into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone;</VERS>
