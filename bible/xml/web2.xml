    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To know wisdom and instruction;    To discern the words of understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">To receive instruction in wise dealing,    In righteousness, justice, and equity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">To give prudence to the simple,    Knowledge and discretion to the young man:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;    That the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">To understand a proverb, and parables,    The words and riddles of the wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge;    But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">My son, listen to your father`s instruction,    And don`t forsake your mother`s teaching:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they will be a garland to grace your head,    And chains around your neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">My son, if sinners entice you, don`t consent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If they say, "Come with us,    Let`s lay in wait for blood;    Let`s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Let`s swallow them up alive like Sheol,    And whole, like those who go down into the pit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We`ll find all valuable wealth.    We`ll fill our houses with spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You shall cast your lot among us.    We`ll all have one purse."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">My son, don`t walk in the way with them.    Keep your foot from their path,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For their feet run to evil.    They hurry to shed blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">These lay wait for their own blood.    They lurk secretly for their own lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain.    It takes away the life of its owners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wisdom calls aloud in the street.    She utters her voice in the public squares.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She calls at the head of noisy places.    At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">"How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?    How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,    And fools hate knowledge?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Turn at my reproof.    Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.    I will make known my words to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Because I have called, and you have refused;    I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But you have ignored all my counsel,    And wanted none of my reproof;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I also will laugh at your disaster.    I will mock when calamity overtakes you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When calamity overtakes you like a storm,    When your disaster comes on like a whirlwind;    When distress and anguish come on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then will they call on me, but I will not answer.    They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Because they hated knowledge,    And didn`t choose the fear of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They wanted none of my counsel.    They despised all my reproof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,    And be filled with their own schemes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.    The careless ease of fools will destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,    And will be at ease, without fear of harm."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, if you will receive my words,    And store up my commandments within you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So as to turn your ear to wisdom,    And apply your heart to understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yes, if you call out for discernment,    And lift up your voice for understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If you seek her as silver,    And search for her as for hidden treasures:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then you will understand the fear of Yahweh,    And find the knowledge of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For Yahweh gives wisdom.    Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.    He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That he may guard the paths of justice,    And preserve the way of his saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then you will understand righteousness and justice,    Equity and every good path.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For wisdom will enter into your heart.    Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Discretion will watch over you.    Understanding will keep you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">To deliver you from the way of evil,    From the men who speak perverse things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Who forsake the paths of uprightness,    To walk in the ways of darkness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Who rejoice to do evil,    And delight in the perverseness of evil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Who are crooked in their ways,    And wayward in their paths:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To deliver you from the strange woman,    Even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Who forsakes the friend of her youth,    And forgets the covenant of her God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For her house leads down to death,    Her paths to the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">None who go to her return again,    Neither do they attain to the paths of life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">That you may walk in the way of good men,    And keep the paths of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the upright will dwell in the land.    The perfect will remain in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the wicked will be cut off from the land.    The treacherous will be rooted out of it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, don`t forget my teaching;    But let your heart keep my commandments:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For length of days, and years of life,    And peace, will they add to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Don`t let kindness and truth forsake you.    Bind them around your neck.    Write them on the tablet of your heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So you will find favor and good understanding in the sight of God       and man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Trust in Yahweh with all your heart,    And don`t lean on your own understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In all your ways acknowledge him,    And he will direct your paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Don`t be wise in your own eyes.    Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It will be health to your body,    And nourishment to your bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Honor Yahweh with your substance,    With the first fruits of all your increase:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So your barns will be filled with plenty,    And your vats will overflow with new wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My son, don`t despise Yahweh`s discipline,    Neither be weary of his reproof:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For whom Yahweh loves, he reproves;    Even as a father the son in whom he delights.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Happy is the man who finds wisdom,    The man who gets understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver,    The profit of it better than fine gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">She is more precious than rubies.    None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Length of days is in her right hand.    In her left hand are riches and honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness.    All her paths are peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.    Happy is everyone who retains her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth.    By understanding, he established the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,    And the skies drop down the dew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">My son, let them not depart from your eyes.    Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So they will be life to your soul,    And grace for your neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then you shall walk in your way securely.    Your foot won`t stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When you lie down, you will not be afraid.    Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Don`t be afraid of sudden fear,    Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For Yahweh will be your confidence,    And will keep your foot from being taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Don`t withhold good from those to whom it is due,    When it is in the power of your hand to do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Don`t say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again,    Tomorrow I will give,"    When you have it by you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Don`t devise evil against your neighbor,    Seeing he dwells securely by you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Don`t strive with a man without cause,    If he has done you no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Don`t envy the man of violence.    Choose none of his ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh,    But his friendship is with the upright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The curse of Yahweh is in the house of the wicked,    But he blesses the habitation of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Surely he mocks the mockers,    But he gives grace to the humble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The wise will inherit glory,    But shame will be the promotion of fools.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Listen, sons, to a father`s instruction.    Pay attention and know understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I give you sound learning.    Don`t forsake my law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I was a son to my father,    Tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He taught me, and said to me:    "Let your heart retain my words.    Keep my commandments, and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Get wisdom. Get understanding.    Don`t forget, neither swerve from the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Don`t forsake her, and she will preserve you.    Love her, and she will keep you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wisdom is supreme. Get wisdom.    Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Esteem her, and she will exalt you.    She will bring you to honor, when you embrace her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">She will give to your head a garland of grace.    A crown of splendor will she deliver to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Listen, my son, and receive my sayings.    The years of your life will be many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I have taught you in the way of wisdom.    I have led you in paths of uprightness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When you go, your steps will not be hampered.    When you run, you will not stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Take firm hold of instruction.    Don`t let her go.    Keep her, for she is your life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Don`t enter into the path of the wicked.    Don`t walk in the way of evil men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Avoid it, and don`t pass by it.    Turn from it, and pass on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For they don`t sleep, unless they do evil. Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness,    And drink the wine of violence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light,    That shines more and more until the perfect day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The way of the wicked is like darkness.    They don`t know what they stumble over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My son, attend to my words.    Turn your ear to my sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Let them not depart from your eyes.    Keep them in the midst of your heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For they are life to those who find them,    And health to their whole body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Keep your heart with all diligence,    For out of it is the wellspring of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Put away from yourself a perverse mouth.    Put corrupt lips far from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let your eyes look straight ahead.    Fix your gaze directly before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Make the path of your feet level.    Let all of your ways be established.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Don`t turn to the right hand nor to the left.    Remove your foot from evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, pay attention to my wisdom.    Turn your ear to my understanding:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That you may maintain discretion,    That your lips may preserve knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.    Her mouth is smoother than oil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,    And as sharp as a two-edged sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her feet go down to death.    Her steps lead straight to Sheol.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">She gives no thought to the way of life.    Her ways are crooked, and she doesn`t know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.    Don`t depart from the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Remove your way far from her.    Don`t come near the door of her house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Lest you give your honor to others,    And your years to the cruel one;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Lest strangers feast on your wealth,    And your labors enrich another man`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You will groan at your latter end,    When your flesh and your body are consumed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And say, "How I have hated instruction,    And my heart despised reproof;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,    Nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have come to the brink of utter ruin,    In the midst of the gathered assembly."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Drink water out of your own cistern,    Running water out of your own well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Should your springs overflow in the streets,    Streams of water in the public squares?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Let them be for yourself alone,    Not for strangers with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Let your spring be blessed.    Rejoice in the wife of your youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">A loving hind and a pleasant doe --    Let her breasts satisfy you at all times.    Be captivated always with her love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?    Why embrace the bosom of another?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh.    He examines all his paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.    The cords of his sin hold him firmly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He will die for lack of instruction.    In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,    If you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You are trapped by the words of your mouth.    You are ensnared with the words of your mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,    Seeing you have come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself.    Press your plea with your neighbor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Give no sleep to your eyes,    Nor slumber to your eyelids.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,    Like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Go to the ant, you sluggard.    Consider her ways, and be wise;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Which having no chief,    Overseer, or ruler,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Provides her bread in the summer,    And gathers her food in the harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">How long will you sleep, sluggard?    When will you arise out of your sleep?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A little sleep, a little slumber,    A little folding of the hands to sleep:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So your poverty will come as a robber,    And your scarcity as an armed man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A worthless person, a man of iniquity,    Is he who walks with a perverse mouth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,    Who motions with his fingers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In whose heart is perverseness,    Who devises evil continually,    Who always sows discord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.    He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There are six things which Yahweh hates;    Yes, seven which are an abomination to him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,    Hands that shed innocent blood;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">A heart that devises wicked schemes,    Feet that are swift in running to mischief,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">A false witness who utters lies,    And he who sows discord among brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My son, keep your father`s commandment,    And don`t forsake your mother`s teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Bind them continually on your heart.    Tie them around your neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When you walk, it will lead you.    When you sleep, it will watch over you.    When you awake, it will talk with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the commandment is a lamp,    And the law is light.    Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">To keep you from the immoral woman,    From the flattery of the wayward wife`s tongue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Don`t lust after her beauty in your heart,    Neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.    The adulteress hunts for your precious life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Can a man scoop fire into his lap,    And his clothes not be burned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Or can one walk on hot coals,    And his feet not be scorched?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So is he who goes in to his neighbor`s wife.    Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Men don`t despise a thief,    If he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But if he be found, he shall restore seven times.    He shall give all the wealth of his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.    He who does it destroys his own soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He will get wounds and dishonor.    His reproach will not be wiped away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.    He won`t spare in the day of vengeance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He won`t regard any ransom,    Neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, keep my words.    Lay up my commandments within you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Keep my commandments and live;    Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Bind them on your fingers.    Write them on the tablet of your heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Tell wisdom, "You are my sister."    Call understanding your relative,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That they may keep you from the strange woman,    From the foreigner who flatters with her words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For at the window of my house,    I looked forth through my lattice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I saw among the simple ones.    I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Passing through the street near her corner,    He went the way to her house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In the twilight, in the evening of the day,    In the middle of the night and in the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,    And with crafty intent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">She is loud and defiant.    Her feet don`t stay in her house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now she is in the streets, now in the squares,    And lurking at every corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So she caught him, and kissed him.    With an impudent face she said to him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me.    This day I have paid my vows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore I came out to meet you,    To diligently seek your face,    And I have found you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,    With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Come, let`s take our fill of loving until the morning.    Let`s solace ourselves with loving.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For my husband isn`t at home.    He has gone on a long journey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He has taken a bag of money with him.    He will come home at the full moon."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">With persuasive words, she led him astray.    With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He followed her immediately,    As an ox goes to the slaughter,    As a fool stepping into a noose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Until an arrow strikes through his liver,    As a bird hurries to the snare,    And doesn`t know that it will cost his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now therefore, sons, listen to me.    Pay attention to the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Don`t let your heart turn to her ways.    Don`t go astray in her paths,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For she has thrown down many wounded.    Yes, all her slain are a mighty host.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Her house is the way to Sheol,    Going down to the chambers of death.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Doesn`t wisdom cry out?    Doesn`t understanding raise her voice?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher; "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Is there a thing of which it may be said, "Behold, this is new?" It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That which is crooked can`t be made straight; and that which is lacking can`t be counted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I said to myself, "Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with mirth: therefore enjoy pleasure;" and, behold, this also was vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I said of laughter, "It is foolishness;" and of mirth, "What does it accomplish?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold of folly, until I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I made myself great works. I built myself houses. I planted myself vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I made myself pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house. I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got myself men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men -- musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also remained with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Whatever my eyes desired, I didn`t keep from them. I didn`t withhold my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked, and at the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly: for what can the king`s successor do? Just that which has been done long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The wise man`s eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness -- and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then said I in my heart, "As it happens to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?" Then said I in my heart that this also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no memory for ever, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. Indeed, the wise man must die just like the fool!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who comes after me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge, and with skillfulness; yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not labored therein. This also is vanity and a great evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For what has a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, in which he labors under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For all his days are sorrows, and his travail is grief; yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For to the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">I said in my heart, "As for the sons of men, God tests them, so that they may see that they themselves are like animals.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Before I formed you in the belly I knew you, and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you; I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh! behold, I don`t know how to speak; for I am a child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Yahweh said to me, Don`t say, I am a child; for to whoever I shall send you, you shall go, and whatever I shall command you, you shall speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Don`t be afraid because of them; for I am with you to deliver you, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Yahweh put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and Yahweh said to me, Behold, I have put my words in your mouth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said Yahweh to me, You have well seen: for I watch over my word to perform it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The word of Yahweh came to me the second time, saying, What see you? I said, I see a boiling caldron; and the face of it is from the north.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Yahweh said to me, Out of the north evil shall break forth on all the inhabitants of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Yahweh; and they shall come, and they shall set everyone his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls of it round about, and against all the cities of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You therefore gird up your loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command you: don`t be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For, behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes of it, against the priests of it, and against the people of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you: for I am with you, says Yahweh, to deliver you.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I remember for you the kindness of your youth, the love of your weddings; how you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Israel [was] holiness to Yahweh, the first-fruits of his increase: all who devour him shall be held guilty; evil shall come on them, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Hear you the word of Yahweh, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">thus says Yahweh, What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, that they have gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Neither said they, Where is Yahweh who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed through, and where no man lived?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit of it and the goodness of it; but when you entered, you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The priests didn`t say, Where is Yahweh? and those who handle the law didn`t know me: the rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore I will yet contend with you, says Yahweh, and with your children`s children will I contend.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For pass over to the isles of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there has been such a thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Has a nation changed [its] gods, which yet are no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Be astonished, you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be you very desolate, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Is Israel a servant? is he a home-born [slave]? why is he become a prey?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The young lions have roared on him, and yelled; and they have made his land waste: his cities are burned up, without inhabitant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Haven`t you procured this to yourself, in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God, when he led you by the way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now what have you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? or what have you to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding shall reprove you: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that you have forsaken Yahweh your God, and that my fear is not in you, says the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds; and you said, I will not serve; for on every high hill and under every green tree you did bow yourself, playing the prostitute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For though you wash you with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me, says the Lord Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">How can you say, I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baals? see your way in the valley, know what you have done: [you are] a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind in her desire; in her occasion who can turn her away? all those who seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, It is in vain; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">who tell a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back to me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But where are your gods that you have made you? let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Why will you contend with me? you all have transgressed against me, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">In vain have I struck your children; they received no correction: your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Generation, see the word of Yahweh. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? or a land of thick darkness? why say my people, We are broken loose; we will come no more to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">How trimmest you your way to seek love! therefore even the wicked women have you taught your ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: you did not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Yet you said, I am innocent; surely his anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with you, because you say, I have not sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Why go you about so much to change your way? you shall be ashamed of Egypt also, as you were ashamed of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">From there also shall you go forth, with your hands on your head: for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust, and you shall not prosper with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man`s, will he return to her again? Won`t that land be greatly polluted? But you have played the prostitute with many lovers; yet return again to me, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see; where have you not been lain with? By the ways have you sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; yet you have a prostitute`s forehead, you refused to be ashamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Will you not from this time cry to me, My Father, you are the guide of my youth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Will he retain [his anger] forever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Moreover Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? she is gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the prostitute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I said after she had done all these things, She will return to me; but she didn`t return: and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, didn`t fear; but she also went and played the prostitute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It happened through the lightness of her prostitution, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not returned to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yahweh said to me, Backsliding Israel has showed herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, says Yahweh; I will not look in anger on you; for I am merciful, says Yahweh, I will not keep [anger] forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed my voice, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Return, backsliding children, says Yahweh; for I am a husband to you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says Yahweh, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Yahweh; neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they remember it; neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Yahweh; and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I said, How I will put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of the nations! and I said, You shall call me My Father, and shall not turn away from following me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so have you dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping [and] the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Return, you backsliding children, I will heal your backsliding. Behold, we are come to you; for you are Yahweh our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Truly in vain is [the help that is looked for] from the hills, the tumult on the mountains: truly in Yahweh our God is the salvation of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Yahweh our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day; and we have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">If you will return, Israel, says Yahweh, if you will return to me, and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight; then you shall not be removed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and you shall swear, As Yahweh lives, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For thus says Yahweh to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and don`t sow among thorns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Declare you in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow you the trumpet in the land: cry aloud and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Set up a standard toward Zion: flee for safety, don`t stay; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make your land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn`t turned back from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It shall happen at that day, says Yahweh, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh! surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace; whereas the sword reaches to the life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">a full wind from these shall come for me: now will I also utter judgments against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots [shall be] as the whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! for we are ruined.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">make you mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, [that] watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">As keepers of a field are they against her round about, because she has been rebellious against me, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Your way and your doings have procured these things to you; this is your wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I can`t hold my peace; because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Destruction on destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my tents destroyed, [and] my curtains in a moment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For my people are foolish, they know don`t me; they are foolish children, and they have no understanding; they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I saw the earth, and, behold, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I saw the mountains, and, behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved back and forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I saw, and, behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the sky were fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I saw, and, behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all the cities of it were broken down at the presence of Yahweh, [and] before his fierce anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For thus says Yahweh, The whole land shall be a desolation; yet will I not make a full end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers; they go into the thickets, and climb up on the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">You, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you deck you with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint, in vain do you make yourself beautiful; [your] lovers despise you, they seek your life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, [saying], Woe is me now! for my soul faints before the murderers.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Run you back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places of it, if you can find a man, if there are any who does justly, who seeks truth; and I will pardon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Though they say, As Yahweh lives; surely they swear falsely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">O Yahweh, don`t your eyes look on truth? you have stricken them, but they were not grieved; you have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they don`t know the way of Yahweh, nor the law of their God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I will get me to the great men, and will speak to them; for they know the way of Yahweh, and the law of their God. But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them, a leopard shall watch against their cities; everyone who goes out there shall be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many, [and] their backsliding is increased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">How can I pardon you? your children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the prostitutes` houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They were as fed horses roaming at large; everyone neighed after his neighbor`s wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Shall I not visit for these things? says Yahweh; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Go you up on her walls, and destroy; but don`t make a full end: take away her branches; for they are not Yahweh`s.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They have denied Yahweh, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come on us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Behold, I will bring a nation on you from far, house of Israel, says Yahweh: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you don`t know, neither understand what they say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Their quiver is an open tomb, they are all mighty men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They shall eat up your harvest, and your bread, [which] your sons and your daughters should eat; they shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig-trees; they shall beat down your fortified cities, in which you trust, with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But even in those days, says Yahweh, I will not make a full end with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It shall happen, when you shall say, Why has Yahweh our God done all these things to us? then shall you say to them, Like as you have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land, so shall you serve strangers in a land that is not yours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Declare you this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Hear now this, foolish people, and without understanding; who have eyes, and don`t see; who have ears, and don`t hear:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Don`t you fear me? says Yahweh: won`t you tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it can`t pass it? and though the waves of it toss themselves, yet they can`t prevail; though they roar, yet they can`t pass over it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear Yahweh our God, who gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season; who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For among my people are found wicked men: they watch, as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap, they catch men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and grew rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They are grew fat, they shine: yes, they overpass in deeds of wickedness; they don`t plead the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and the right of the needy they don`t judge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Shall I not visit for these things? says Yahweh; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">A wonderful and horrible thing is happen in the land:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will you do in the end of it?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looks forth from the north, and a great destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed everyone in his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Prepare you war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! for the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For thus has Yahweh of Hosts said, Hew you down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As a well casts forth its waters, so she casts forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Be you instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you; lest I make you a desolation, a land not inhabited.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Thus says Yahweh of Hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again your hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they can`t listen: behold, the word of Yahweh is become to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore I am full of the wrath of Yahweh; I am weary with holding in: pour it out on the children in the street, and on the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him who is full of days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Their houses shall be turned to others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, says Yahweh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now at that time the king of Babylon`s army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy, and say, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, says Yahweh: though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jeremiah said, The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">So Hanamel my uncle`s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Yahweh, and said to me, Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is your, and the redemption is your; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle`s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, [according to] the law and custom, and that which was open:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle`s [son], and in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I charged Baruch before them, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">You have said to me, Lord Yahweh, Buy you the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">They have turned to me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [the fire] to Molech; which I didn`t command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Now therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof you say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For thus says Yahweh: Like as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so will I bring on them all the good that I have promised them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Fields shall be bought in this land, whereof you say, It is desolate, without man or animal; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says Yahweh, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord Yahweh lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Those who escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">This shall be the sign to you, says Yahweh, that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="59">The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For through the anger of Yahweh did it happen in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king`s garden; (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about;) and they went toward the Arabah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh-the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness of it was four fingers: it was hollow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">A capital of brass was on it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital round about, all of brass: and the second pillar also had like these, and pomegranates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper; For Yahweh has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an       unclean thing; All who honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: Yes, she sighs, and turns backward.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">The Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and has       not pitied: He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of       Judah; He has brought them down to the ground; he has profaned the kingdom and       the princes of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He has cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel; He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy: He has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devours round about.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it happened in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In the fifth [day] of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin`s captivity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">the word of Yahweh came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Yahweh was there on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with flashing lightning, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst of it as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Everyone had four faces, and everyone of them had four wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf`s foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings [thus]:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">their wings were joined one to another; they didn`t turn when they went; they went everyone straight forward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Their faces and their wings were separate above; two [wings] of everyone were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They went everyone straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; they didn`t turn when they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: [the fire] went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn`t turn when they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like the awesome crystal to look on, stretched forth over their heads above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Under the expanse were their wings straight, the one toward the other: everyone had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">He said to me, Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He said to me, Son of man, go, get you to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: don`t be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It happened at the end of seven days, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When I tell the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn`t turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Again, when a righteous man does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The hand of Yahweh was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Yahweh stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet; and he spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself within your house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But you, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands on you, and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be mute, and shall not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: He who hears, let him hear; and he who forbears, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened in the sixth year, in the sixth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Yahweh fell there on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw, and, behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the sky, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner [court] that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and see, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He said to me, Son of man, see you what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but you shall again see yet other great abominations.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore speak to them, and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I Yahweh will answer him therein according to the multitude of his idols;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore tell the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Return you, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For everyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, and takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to inquire for himself of me; I Yahweh will answer him by myself:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, Yahweh, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand on him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, says the Lord Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand on it, and break the staff of the bread of it, and send famine on it, and cut off from it man and animal;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, says the Lord Yahweh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only should be delivered, but the land should be desolate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and animal;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only should be delivered themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath on it in blood, to cut off from it man and animal;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh, they should deliver neither son nor daughter; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For thus says the Lord Yahweh: How much more when I send my four sore judgments on Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil animals, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and animal!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth to you, and you shall see their way and their doings; and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">As for your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut, neither were you washed in water to cleanse you; you weren`t salted at all, nor swaddled at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you, to have compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field, for that your person was abhorred, in the day that you were born.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had various colors, came to Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs of it, and carried it to a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters; he set it as a willow-tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots of it were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Say you, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots of it, and cut off the fruit of it, that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? and not by a strong arm or much people can it be raised from the roots of it.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened in the seventh year, in the fifth [month], the tenth [day] of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Yahweh, and sat before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Is it to inquire of me that you have come? As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will not be inquired of by you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: In the day when I chose Israel, and swore to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, I am Yahweh your God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">in that day I swore to them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I said to them, Cast you away every man the abominations of his eyes, and don`t defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Yahweh your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But I worked for my name`s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I gave them my statutes, and showed them my ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they didn`t walk in my statutes, and they rejected my ordinances, which if a man keep, he shall live in them; and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them in the wilderness, to consume them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But I worked for my name`s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">I said to their children in the wilderness, Don`t you walk in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name`s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers` idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they should not live;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through [the fire] all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: In this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For when I had brought them into the land, which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also they made their sweet savor, and they poured out there their drink-offerings.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, says the Lord Yahweh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">The names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians [her] neighbors,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">She bestowed her prostitution on them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Neither has she left her prostitution since [the days of] Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity; and they poured out their prostitution on her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she doted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and her they killed with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgments on her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her prostitution which were more than the prostitution of her sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She doted on the Assyrians, governors and rulers, [her] neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">She increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">As soon as she saw them she doted on them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">She doted on their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth, in the handling of your bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of your youth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I give her cup into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Thus says the Lord Yahweh: You shall drink of your sister`s cup, which is deep and large; you shall be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it contains much.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">You shall even drink it and drain it out, and you shall gnaw the broken pieces of it, and shall tear your breasts; for I have spoken it, says the Lord Yahweh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">He changes the times and the seasons; he removes kings, and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those who have understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">he reveals the deep and secret things; he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I thank you, and praise you, you God of my fathers, who have given me wisdom and might, and have now made known to me what we desired of you; for you have made known to us the king`s matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus to him: Don`t destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king answered Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation of it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show to the king;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">as for you, O king, your thoughts came [into your mind] on your bed, what should happen hereafter; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what shall happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">You, O king, saw, and, behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before you; and the aspect of it was awesome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You saw until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and wherever the children of men dwell, the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand, and has made you to rule over them all: you are the head of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">After you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">The fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things; and as iron that crushes all these, shall it break in pieces and crush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters` clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, because you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">As the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cling to one another, even as iron does not mingle with clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">In the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty of it be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what shall happen hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation of it sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odors to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you have been able to reveal this secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, peoples, nations, and languages,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">and whoever doesn`t fall down and worships shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They answered Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You, O king, have made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and whoever doesn`t fall down and worships, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded you: they don`t serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nebuchadnezzar answered them, Is it on purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that you don`t serve my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now if you are ready whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music to you fall down and worship the image which I have made, [well]: but if you don`t worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered the king, Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If it be [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: [therefore] he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, [and] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then these men were bound in their pants, their tunics, and their mantles, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore because the king`s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spoke and said to his counselors, Didn`t we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered the king, True, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered, Look, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, you servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king`s counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their pants changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and have changed the king`s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god who is able to deliver after this sort.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, [saying],</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus were the visions of my head on my bed: I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and the height of it was great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The tree grew, and was strong, and the height of it reached to the sky, and the sight of it to the end of all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The leaves of it were beautiful, and the fruit of it much, and in it was food for all: the animals of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the sky lived in the branches of it, and all flesh was fed from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the animals get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky: and let his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">let his heart be changed from man`s, and let a animal`s heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whoever he will, and sets up over it the lowest of men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to the sky, and the sight of it to all the earth;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come on my lord the king:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">All this came on the king Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">The same hour was the thing fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the sky, until his hair was grown like eagles` [feathers], and his nails like birds` [claws].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him who lives forever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king`s interdict: Haven`t you signed an interdict, that every man who shall make petition to any god or man within thirty days, save to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn`t alter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, doesn`t regard you, O king, nor the interdict that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then these men assembled together to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. [Now] the king spoke and said to Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">A stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When he came near to the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spoke and said to Daniel, Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then said Daniel to the king, O king, live forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions` mouths, and they have not hurt me; because as before him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, have I done no hurt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and steadfast forever, His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be even to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the sky broke forth on the great sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Four great animals came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The first was like a lion, and had eagle`s wings: I saw until the wings of it were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand on two feet as a man; and a man`s heart was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Behold, another animal, a second, like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After this I saw, and, behold, another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the animal had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth animal, awesome and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the animals that were before it; and it had ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I saw until thrones were placed, and one who was ancient of days sat: his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, [and] the wheels of it burning fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke; I saw even until the animal was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As for the rest of the animals, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">There was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These great animals, which are four, are four kings, who shall arise out of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal, which was diverse from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other [horn] which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I saw, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Thus he said, The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole the sky, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my face was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no animals could stand before him, neither was there any who could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth, and didn`t touch the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled on him; and there was none who could deliver the ram out of his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The male goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable [horns] toward the four winds of the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious [land].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">It grew great, even to the host of the sky; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual [burnt offering], and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The host was given over [to it] together with the continual [burnt offering] through disobedience; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did [its pleasure] and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, How long shall be the vision [concerning] the continual [burnt-offering], and the disobedience that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said to me, To two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It happened, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I heard a man`s voice between [the banks of] the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, son of man; for the vision belongs to the time of the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He said, Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The rough male goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">As for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce face, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">His power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do [his pleasure]; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in [their] security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true: but shut you up the vision; for it belongs to many days [to come].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king`s business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years whereof the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishing of the desolations of Jerusalem, even seventy years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and petitions, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I prayed to Yahweh my God, and made confession, and said, Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful God, who keeps covenant and lovingkindness with those who love him and keep his commandments,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">neither have we obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yes, all Israel have transgressed your law, even turning aside, that they should not obey your voice: therefore has the curse been poured out on us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us, by bringing on us a great evil; for under the whole sky has not been done as has been done on Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come on us: yet have we not entreated the favor of Yahweh our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in your truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore has Yahweh watched over the evil, and brought it on us; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all his works which he does, and we have not obeyed his voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now, Lord our God, who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have gotten you renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Lord, according to all your righteousness, let your anger and please let your wrath be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people are become a reproach to all who are round about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now therefore, our God, listen to the prayer of your servant, and to his petitions, and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord`s sake.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach against it, for their wickedness has come up before me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh. He went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid its fare, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was likely brake up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god. They threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea, to lighten it. But Jonah had gone down into the innermost parts of the ship, and he was laying down, and was fast asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, "What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, call on your gods! Maybe the gods will notice us, so that we won`t perish."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They all said to each other, "Come, let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is on us." So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then they asked him, "Tell us, please, for whose cause this evil is on us. What is your occupation? Where do you come from? What is your country? Of what people are you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said to them, "I am a Hebrew, and I fear Yahweh, the God of heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him, "What is this that you have done?" For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Yahweh, because he had told them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said they to him, "What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us?" For the sea grew more and more tempestuous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said to them, "Take me up, and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will be calm for you; for I know that because of me this great tempest is on you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore they cried to Yahweh, and said, "We beg you, Yahweh, we beg you, let us not perish for this man`s life, and don`t lay on us innocent blood; for you, Yahweh, have done as it pleased you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea ceased its raging.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the men feared Yahweh exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh, and made vows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Yahweh prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish`s belly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said, "I called because of my affliction to Yahweh.    He answered me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried.    You heard my voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For you threw me into the depths,    In the heart of the seas. The flood was all around me.    All your waves and your billows passed over me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I said, `I have been banished from your sight;    Yet I will look again toward your holy temple.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The waters surrounded me,    Even to the soul. The deep was around me.    The weeds were wrapped around my head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I went down to the bottoms of the mountains.    The earth barred me in forever:    Yet have you brought up my life from the pit, Yahweh my God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh.    My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving.    I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation belongs to Yahweh."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Yahweh came to Jonah the second time, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the message that I give you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to the word of Yahweh. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, three days` journey across.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jonah began to enter into the city a day`s journey, and he cried out, and said, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The news reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and took off his royal robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He made a proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, "Let neither man nor animal, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and animal, and let them cry mightily to God. Yes, let them turn everyone from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Who knows whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, so that we might not perish?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way. God repented of the evil which he said he would do to them, and he didn`t do it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He prayed to Yahweh, and said, "Please, Yahweh, wasn`t this what I said when I was still in my own country? Therefore I hurried to flee to Tarshish, for I knew that you are a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and you repent of the evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore now, Yahweh, take, I beg you, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yahweh said, "Is it right for you to be angry?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made himself a booth, and sat under it in the shade, until he might see what would become of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yahweh God prepared a vine, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the gourd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But God prepared a worm at dawn the next day, and it chewed on vine, so that it withered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah`s head , so that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, "It is better for me to die than to live."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God said to Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry about the vine?"     He said, "I am right to be angry, even to death."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yahweh said, "You have been concerned for the vine, for which you have not labored, neither made it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Shouldn`t I be concerned for Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred twenty thousand persons who can`t discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened that when Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed there to teach and preach in their cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now when John heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Blessed is he, whoever finds no occasion for stumbling in me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in king`s houses.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the seaside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, "Behold, the farmer went forth to sow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn`t have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Others fell on thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred times, some sixty, and some thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The disciples came, and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever doesn`t have, from him will be taken away even that which he has.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don`t see, and hearing, they don`t hear, neither do they understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says,  `By hearing you will hear, and will in no way understand; Seeing you will see, and will in no way perceive:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this people`s heart has grown callous, Their ears are dull of hearing, Their eyes they have closed; Or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes, Hear with their ears, Understand with their heart, And should turn again; And I would heal them.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For most assuredly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didn`t see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn`t hear them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">"Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and doesn`t understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most assuredly bears fruit, and brings forth, some one hundred times, some sixty, some thirty."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel also among the wheat, and went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the darnel appeared also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The servants of the householder came and said to him, `Sir, didn`t you sow good seed in your field? Where did this darnel come from?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He said to them, `An enemy has done this.` The servants asked him, `Do you want us to go and gather them up?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he said, `No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel, you root up the wheat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, "First, gather up the darnel, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn."`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He spoke another parable to them. "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn`t speak to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,  "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the darnel of the field."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He answered them, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the darnel are the sons of the evil one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">As therefore the darnel is gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be in the end of this age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Son of Man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="49">So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="51">Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?"     They answered him, "Yes, Lord."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">He said to them, "Therefore, every scribe who has been made a disciple to the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings forth out of his treasure new and old things."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">It happened, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so much that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="57">They were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">He answered them, "Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For God commanded, `Honor your father and your mother,` and, `He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But you say, `Whoever will tell his father or his mother, "Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">he will not honor his father or mother.` You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">`These people draw near to me with their mouth, And honor me with their lips; But their heart is far from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as doctrine rules made by men.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He called the multitude to himself, and said to them, "Hear, and understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">That which enters into the mouth doesn`t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the disciples came, and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he answered, "Every plant which my heavenly Father didn`t plant will be uprooted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Peter answered him, "Explain the parable to us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Jesus said, "Do you also still not understand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Don`t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart, and they defile the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn`t defile the man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David. My daughter is grievously vexed with a demon."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he answered her not a word.     His disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away; for she cries after us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But he answered, "I wasn`t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But she came and worshipped him, saying, "Lord, help me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But he answered, "It is not appropriate to take the children`s bread and throw it to the dogs."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But she said, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters` table."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">There came to him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">so that the multitude wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the injured whole, lame walking, and the blind seeing -- and they glorified the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, "I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don`t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The disciples said to him, "Where should we get so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?"     They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But he answered them, "When it is evening, you say, `It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In the morning, `It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.` Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can`t discern the signs of the times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah."     He left them, and departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They reasoned among themselves, saying, "We took no bread."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus, perceiving it, said, "Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, `because you have brought no bread?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Don`t you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">How is it that you don`t perceive that I didn`t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they understood that he didn`t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, "Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am ?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They said, "Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I also tell you, that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you will bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you will loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then he charged the disciples that they should tell no man that he was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">From that time, Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he turned, and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling-block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but the things of men."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If any man desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For what will it profit a man, if he will gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then will he render to every man according to his deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Most assuredly I tell you, there are some standing here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became white as the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Peter answered, and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let`s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus came and touched them and said, "Get up, and don`t be afraid."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Don`t tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">His disciples asked him, saying, "Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered them, "Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn`t recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so will the Son of Man also suffer by them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When they came to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling to him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, "Why couldn`t we cast it out?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said to them, "Because of your unbelief. For most assuredly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, `Move from here to there,` and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But this kind doesn`t go out except by prayer and fasting."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up."     They were exceedingly sorry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When they were come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachmas came to Peter, and said, "Doesn`t your teacher pay the didrachma?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said, "Yes."     When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their sons, or from strangers?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Peter said to him, "From strangers."     Jesus said to him, "Therefore the sons are exempt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened his mouth, you will find a stater. Take that, and give it to them for me and you."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in the midst of them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and said, "Most assuredly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Whoever therefore will humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Whoever will receive one such little child in my name receives me,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">See that you don`t despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn`t he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">If he happens to find it, most assuredly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if he doesn`t listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Most assuredly I tell you, whatever things you will bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever things you will loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the midst of them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Peter came and said to him, "Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said to him, "I don`t tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But because he couldn`t pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him, saying, `Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him one hundred denarii, and he laid hold on him, and took him by the throat, saying, `Pay me what you owe!`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So his fellow-servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, `Have patience with me, and I will repay you.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then his lord called him in, and said to him, `You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Shouldn`t you also have had mercy on your fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on you?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">They asked him, "Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce her?"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">The disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">"Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">When therefore the lord of the vineyard will come, what will he do to those farmers?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They told him, "He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruits in their seasons."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the scriptures, `The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner. This was from the Lord. It is marvelous in our eyes?`</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the king was angry, and he sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then he said to his servants, `The wedding is ready, but they who were invited were not worthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn`t have on wedding-clothing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and he said to him, `Friend, how did you come in here not having wedding-clothing?` He was speechless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the king said to the servants, `Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For many are called, but few chosen."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter who you teach, for you aren`t partial to anyone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God`s angels in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven`t you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">A second likewise is this, `You shall love your neighbor as yourself.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="43">He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">"If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">"Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But at midnight there was a cry, `Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The foolish said to the wise, `Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But the wise answered, saying, `What if there will not be enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, `Lord, Lord, open to us.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But he answered, `Most assuredly I tell you, I don`t know you.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Watch therefore, for you don`t know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"For it is like a man, going into another country, who called his own servants, and delivered his goods to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability, and he went on his journey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In like manner he also who got the two gained another two.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord`s money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, `Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">His lord said to him, `Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He also who got the two talents came and said, `Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">His lord said to him, `Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He also who had received the one talent came and said, `Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have your own.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But his lord answered him, `You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn`t sow, and gather where I didn`t scatter.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then the King will tell them on his right hand, `Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">Then the righteous will answer him, saying, `Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">The King will answer them, `Most assuredly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then will he say also to them on the left hand, `Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">for I was hungry, and you didn`t give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">I was a stranger, and you didn`t take me in; naked, and you didn`t clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn`t visit me.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then will they also answer, saying, `Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not help you?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then will he answer them, saying, `Most assuredly I tell you, inasmuch as you didn`t do it to one of these least, you didn`t do it to me.`</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened, when Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they said, "Not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But when his disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, "Why this waste?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Jesus, knowing this, said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For you always have the poor with you; but you don`t always have me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For in that she poured this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Most assuredly I tell you, wherever this gospel will be preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and said, "What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver him to you?" They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">From that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, "Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, `The Teacher says, "My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">As they were eating, he said, "Most assuredly I tell you, that one of you will betray me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, "It isn`t me, is it, Lord?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He answered, "He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Judas, who betrayed him, answered, "It isn`t me, is it, Rabbi?"     He said to him, "So you have said."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, "Drink all of it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father`s kingdom."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be offended by me tonight, for it is written, `I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered abroad.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But Peter answered him, "Even if all will be offended by you, I will never be offended."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to him, "Most assuredly I tell you, that tonight, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you." All of the disciples also said likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go there and pray."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then he said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I want, but what you want."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "What, couldn`t you watch with me for one hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and pray, that you don`t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup can`t pass away from me, unless I drink it, your will be done."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, "Whoever I will kiss, that is he. Take him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Or do you think that I can`t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn`t arrest me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But all this has happened, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled."     Then all the disciples left him, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">and said, "This man said, `I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">The high priest stood up, and answered him, "Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus held his peace. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Jesus said to him, "You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, henceforth you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">What do you think?"     They answered, "He is worthy of death!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus, the Galilean."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But he denied before them all, saying, "I don`t know what you are talking about."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, "This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">Again he denied with an oath, "I don`t know the man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then began he to curse and to swear, "I don`t know the man!"     Immediately the cock crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, "Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times." He went out and wept bitterly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">saying, "I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood."     But they said, "What is that to us? You see to it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They took counsel, and bought with them the potter`s field, to bury strangers in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore that field was called "The Field of Blood" to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was priced, whom some of the children of Israel did price,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and they gave them for the potter`s field, as the Lord commanded me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?"     Jesus said to him, "So you say."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Pilate said to him, "Don`t you hear how many things they testify against you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now at the feast the governor used to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they wanted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But the governor answered them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?"     They said, "Barabbas!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate said to them, "What then will I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?"     They all said to him, "Let him be crucified!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the governor said, "Why? What evil has he done?"     But they cried out exceedingly, saying, "Let him be crucified!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So when Pilate saw that nothing was gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">All the people answered, "May his blood be on us, and on our children!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the governor`s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered to him the whole cohort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They came to a place called "Golgotha," that is to say, "The place of a skull."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">and they sat and watched him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They set up over his head his accusation written, "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and saying, "You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders, said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">"He saved others, but he can`t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusts in God. Let him deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, `I am the Son of God.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" That is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, "This man calls Elijah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The rest said, "Let him be. Let`s see whether Elijah comes to save him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">among whom was Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">When evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus` disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">This man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Now on the next day, which is the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">saying, "Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: `After three days I will rise again.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, `He is risen from the dead;` and the last deception will be worse than the first."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">So they went, and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The angel answered the women, "Don`t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Go quickly and tell his disciples, `He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.` Behold, I have told you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!"     They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus said to them, "Don`t be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they may go into Galilee, and there they will see me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">saying, "Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If this comes to the governor`s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">As it is written in the prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, `Make ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There went out to him all the country of Judea, and all those of Jerusalem. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">John was clothed with camel`s hair and a leather belt around his loins. He ate locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">A voice came out of the sky, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals. The angels ministered to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand! Repent, and believe in the gospel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Going on a little further from there, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">saying, "Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now Simon`s wife`s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed with demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">All the city was gathered together at the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn`t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Early in the night, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Simon and those who were with him followed after him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">and they found him, and told him, "All are seeking you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He said to them, "Let`s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, for to this end I came forth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">There came to him a leper, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, "If you want to, you can make me clean."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and said to him, "I want to. Be made clean."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He strictly charged him, and immediately sent him out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and said to him, "See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was laying on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? He blasphemes! Who can forgive sins but one - God?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you reason these things in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, `Your sins are forgiven;` or to say, `Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" -- he said to the paralytic,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the place of toll, and he said to him, "Follow me." And he arose and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It happened, that he was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, "Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">John`s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, "Why do John`s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don`t fast?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said to them, "Can the sons of the bride chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can`t fast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It happened, that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said to them, "Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and they who were with him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said to the man who had his hand withered, "Stand up."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?" But they were silent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The Pharisees went out, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He spoke to his disciples, that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn`t press on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, "You are the Son of God!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He went up into the mountain, and called to himself whom he wanted, and they went to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">James the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.     He came into a house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, "He is insane."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebul," and, "By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He called them to him, and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can`t stand, but has an end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Most assuredly I tell you, all their sins will be forgiven to the sons of men, and their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">-- because they said, "He has an unclean spirit."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, "Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are outside looking for you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He answered them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For whoever may do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"Listen! Behold, the farmer went forth to sow,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He said to them, "To you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that `seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He said to them, "Don`t you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The farmer sows the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">These are they by the road, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">These in like manner are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They have no root in themselves, but endure for a while, then, when oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">These are those who were sown on the good ground: such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He said to them, "Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under the bed? Isn`t it put on the lampstand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He said to them, "Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who has not, from him will be taken away even that which he has."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He said, "So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn`t know how.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He said, "How will we liken the kingdom of God? Or by what parable will we compare it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Without a parable he didn`t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let`s go over to the other side."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">There arose a great wind storm, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, "Teacher, don`t you care that we are dying?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace. Be still." The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">who had his dwelling in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don`t torment me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For he said to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He asked him, "What is your name?"     He said to him, "My name is Legion, for we are many."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now there was there on the mountainside a great herd of pigs feeding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All the demons begged him, saying, "Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out, and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country.     The people came to see what it was that had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They came to Jesus, and saw him who was possessed by demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They began to beg him to depart from their borders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He didn`t allow him, but said to him, "Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them how the Lord has done great things for you, and how he had mercy on you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and begged him much, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For she said, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone forth from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">His disciples said to him, "You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, `Who touched me?`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He looked around to see her who had done this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">While he was still speaking, they came from the synagogue ruler`s house saying, "Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Don`t be afraid, only believe."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He came to the synagogue ruler`s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When he had entered in, he said to them, "Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, "Talitha cumi;" which means, being interpreted, "Young lady, I tell you, get up."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Immediately the young lady rose up, and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He charged them much that no one should know this. He commanded that something should be given to her to eat.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">He went out from there. He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get these things?" and, "What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Isn`t this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Aren`t his sisters here with us?" They were offended by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick folk, and healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He marveled because of their unbelief.     He went around the villages teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He charged them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said to them, "Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They went out, and preached that people should repent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, "John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers work in him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But others said, "It is Elijah." Others said, "It is the Prophet, or like one of the prophets."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Herod, when he heard this, said, "This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Herod himself had sent out and laid hold on John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip`s wife, for he had married her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother`s wife."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldn`t,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When a convenient day had come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his lords, and the high captains, and the chief men of Galilee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those reclining with him. The king said to the young lady, "Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He swore to her, "Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">She went out, and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?"     She said, "The head of John the Baptizer."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">She came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn`t wish to refuse her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Immediately the king sent forth a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John`s head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He said to them, "You come apart into a desert place, and rest awhile." For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They went away in the boat to a desert place by themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, "This place is a desert, and it is late in the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he answered them, "You give them something to eat."     They asked him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go see."     When they knew, they said, "Five, and two fish."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He commanded those that all should sit down by companies on the green grass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They all ate, and were filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Immediately he made his disciples enter into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">After he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them; and about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he would have passed by them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, "Cheer up! It is I! Don`t be afraid."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He went up to them into the boat; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">for they hadn`t understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">When they had crossed over, they came to the land to Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">and ran around that whole region, and began to carry around those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don`t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They don`t eat when they come from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why don`t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He answered them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, `This people honors me with their lips, But their heart is far from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men -- the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said to them, "Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For Moses said, `Honor your father and your mother;` and, `He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But you say, `If a man will tell his father or his mother, "Whatever you might have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, given to God;"`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When he had entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said to them, "Are you so without understanding also? Don`t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can`t defile him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">because it doesn`t go into his heart, but into his belly, and into the latrine, thus making all foods clean?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said, "That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and wanted no one to know it, but he couldn`t escape detection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children`s bread and throw it to the dogs."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But she answered him, "Yes, Lord. For even the dogs under the table eat the children`s crumbs."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He said to her, "For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">She went away to her house, and found the child laying on the bed, with the demon gone out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha!" that is, "Be opened!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke clearly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He charged them that they should tell no one, but the more he charged them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to himself, and said to them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">His disciples answered him, "From where will one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?"     They said, "Seven."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking a sign from heaven from him, and tempting him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Most assuredly I tell you, there will no sign be given to this generation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They forgot to take bread; and they didn`t have more than one loaf in the boat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He charged them, saying, "Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They reasoned with one another, saying, "It`s because we have no bread."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, "Why do you reason that it`s because you have no bread? Don`t you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart still hardened?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Having eyes, don`t you see? Having ears, don`t you hear? Don`t you remember?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?"     They told him, "Twelve."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">"When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?"     They told him, "Seven."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He asked them, "Don`t you understand, yet?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He looked up, and said, "I see men; for I see them like trees walking."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then again he laid his hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He sent him away to his house, saying, "Don`t enter into the village, nor tell anyone in the village."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Jesus went forth, with his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, "Who do men say that I am?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They told him, "John the Baptizer, and others, Elijah, but others, one of the prophets."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He asked them, "But who do you say that I am?"     Peter answered, "You are the Christ."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He charged them that they should tell no one about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He spoke to them openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, "Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">He said to them, "Most assuredly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death, until they see the kingdom of God come with power."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">They kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Having cried out, and convulsed him greatly, it came out. The boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said, "He is dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn`t we cast it out?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He said to them, "This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They went forth from there, and passed through Galilee. He didn`t want anyone to know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For he taught his disciples, and said to them, "The Son of Man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise again."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone who doesn`t follow us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he doesn`t follow us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But Jesus said, "Don`t forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">When they had come, they asked him, "Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don`t defer to anyone; for you aren`t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?"     The common people heard him gladly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">In his teaching he said to them, "Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">those who devour widows` houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">There came a poor widow, and she cast in two lepta, which make a quadrans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He called his disciples to himself, and said to them, "Most assuredly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might sieze him by deception, and kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For they said, "Not during the feast, because there might be a riot of the people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, there came a woman having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard -- very costly. She broke the jar, and poured it over his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But there were some who had indignation among themselves, saying, "Why has this ointment been wasted?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor." They grumbled against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">She has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Most assuredly I tell you, wherever this gospel may be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman has done will be spoken of for a memorial of her."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make ready that you may eat the Passover?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He sent two of his disciples, and said to them, "Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, `The Teacher says, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Make ready for us there."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When it was evening he came with the twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As they sat and were eating, Jesus said, "Most assuredly I tell you, one of you will betray me -- he who eats with me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, "Surely not I?" And another said, "Surely not I?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He answered them, "It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, "Take, eat. This is my body."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He said to them, "This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Most assuredly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, `I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But Peter said to him, "Although all will be offended, yet I will not."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus said to him, "Most assuredly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But he spoke all the more, "If I must die with you, I will not deny you." Likewise, they all said so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I pray."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly alarmed and distressed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I want, but what you want."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn`t you watch one hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Watch and pray, that you not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Again he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn`t know what to answer him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He came the third time, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came -- and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, "Whoever I will kiss, that is he. Take him, and lead him away safely."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">When he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, "Rabbi! Rabbi!" and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">They laid their hands on him, and took him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Jesus answered them, "Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn`t arrest me. But this is so that the scriptures might be fulfilled."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">They all left him, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">A certain young man followed with him, having a linen cloth thrown around him, over his naked body. The young men grabbed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">They led Jesus away to the high priest. There came together with him all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Peter had followed him afar off, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn`t agree with each other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">"We heard him say, `I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Even so their testimony did not agree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">The high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Jesus said, "I AM. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">The high priest tore his clothes, and said, "What further need have we of witnesses?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?" They all condemned him to be worthy of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, "Prophesy!" The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">As Peter was beneath in the court, one of the maids of the high priest came,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, "You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">But he denied it, saying, "I neither know, nor understand what you are saying." He went out into the porch, and the cock crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, "This is one of them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, "You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">But he began to curse, and to swear, "I don`t know this man of whom you speak!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">The cock crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, "Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times." When he thought about that, he wept.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"     He answered, "So you say."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The chief priests accused him of many things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But Jesus made no further answer, so Pilate marveled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Pilate again asked them, "What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They cried out again, "Crucify him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?"     But they cried out exceedingly, "Crucify him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and delivered Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, "The place of a skull."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn`t take it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">It was the third hour, and they crucified him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The superscription of his accusation was written over him, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The scripture was fulfilled, which says, "He was numbered with transgressors."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">save yourself, and come down from the cross!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, "He saved others. He can`t save himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him." Those who were crucified with him reproached him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which is, being interpreted, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, "Behold, he calls Elijah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Let him be. Let`s see whether Elijah comes to take him down."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="46">He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Because many have undertaken to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">even as they delivered them to us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now it happened, while he executed the priest`s office before God in the order of his division,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">according to the custom of the priest`s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the angel said to him, "Don`t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother`s womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He will go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, `to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,` and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Zacharias said to the angel, "How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didn`t believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled while he delayed in the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It happened, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">"Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Simon answered him, "Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus` knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and so also were  James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, "Don`t be afraid. From now on you will catch men alive."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It happened, while he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want to. Be made clean."     Immediately the leprosy departed from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He charged him to tell no one, "But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing, according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">It happened on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Seeing their faith, he said to him, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, "Why are you reasoning so in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Which is easier to say, `Your sins are forgiven you;` or to say, `Arise and walk?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" (he said to the paralyzed man), "I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen strange things today."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office, and said to him, "Follow me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He left everything, and rose up and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Levi made him a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus answered them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They said to him, "Why do John`s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He said to them, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then will they fast in those days."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He also told a parable to them. "No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, `The old is better.`"</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first, that he was going through the grain fields, and his disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus, answering them, said, "Haven`t you read this, what David did, when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He said to them, "The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It also happened on another Sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, "Rise up, and stand in the middle." He arose and stood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesus said to them, "I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He looked around at them all, and said to him, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It happened in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A certain centurion`s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, "He is worthy for you to do this for him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, "Lord, don`t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore I didn`t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, `Go!` and he goes; and to another, `Come!` and he comes; and to my servant, `Do this,` and he does it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, "I tell you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">It happened soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples went with him, along with a great multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, "Don`t cry."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, "Young man, I tell you, arise!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He who was dead sat up, and began to speak. He gave him to his mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Fear took hold on all, and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us," and, "God has visited his people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The disciples of John told him about all these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, "Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When the men had come to him, they said, "John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, `Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Blessed is he who is not offended by me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When John`s messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings` courts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This is he of whom it is written, `Behold, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way before you.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">"For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they justified God, being baptized with John`s baptism.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Lord said, "To what then will I liken the men of this generation? What are they like?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee`s house, and sat at the table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee`s house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="47">Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God, and with him the twelve,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod`s steward, Susanna; and many others; who ministered to them from their possessions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell by the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times." As he said these things, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then his disciples asked him, "What does this parable mean?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that `seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Those by the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, and fall away in time of temptation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn`t have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">It was told him by some saying, "Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he answered them, "My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now it happened on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, "Let`s go over to the other side of the lake." So they launched out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They came to him, and awoke him, saying, "Master, master, we are dying!" He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said to them, "Where is your faith?" Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, "Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city met him, who had demons for a long time. He wore no clothes, and didn`t live in a house, but in the tombs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, "What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don`t torment me!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus asked him, "What is your name?"     He said, "Legion," for many demons had entered into him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They begged him who he would not command them to go into the abyss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The demons came out from the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons were gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Those who saw it told them how he who was possessed with demons was healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">"Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you." He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">It happened, as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus` feet, and begged him to come into his house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes thronged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">came behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Jesus said, "Who touched me?"     When all denied, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, `Who touched me?`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But Jesus said, "Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He said to her, "Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue`s house came, saying to him, "Your daughter is dead. Don`t trouble the Teacher."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But Jesus hearing it, answered him, "Don`t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">When he came to the house, he didn`t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the girl, and her mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">All were weeping, and mourning her, but he said, "Don`t weep. She isn`t dead, but sleeping."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">They laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, "Little girl, arise!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Her parents were amazed, but he charged them to tell no one what had been done.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey -- neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As many as don`t receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Herod, the tetrarch, heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Herod said, "John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?" He sought to see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done.     He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, "Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get provisions, for we are here in a desert place."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he said to them, "You give them something to eat."     They said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For they were about five thousand men.     He said to his disciples, "Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They did so, and made them all sit down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">It happened, as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him, and he asked them, "Who do the multitudes say that I am?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They answered, "`John the Baptizer,` but others say, `Elijah,` and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"     Peter answered, "The Christ of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said to all, "If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of himself, of the Father, and of the holy angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the kingdom of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">It happened about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Behold, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elijah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">It happened, as they were parting from him, that Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let`s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah," not knowing what he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">It happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn`t."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation, how long will I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">They were all astonished at the majesty of God.     But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">"Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But they didn`t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their heart, took a little child, and set him by his side,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">and said to them, "Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">John answered, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn`t follow with us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus said to him, "Don`t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and sent messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">They didn`t receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, "Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But he turned and rebuked them, "You don`t know what kind of spirit you are of.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">For the Son of Man didn`t come to destroy men`s lives, but to save them."     They went to another village.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, "I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">He said to another, "Follow me."     But he said, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">But Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the kingdom of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Another also said, "I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">But Jesus said to him, "No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after these things the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two before his face into every city and place, where he himself was about to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then he said to them, "The harvest is indeed  plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals. Greet no one on the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Into whatever house you enter, first say, `Peace be to this house.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Remain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Don`t go from house to house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Heal the sick who are therein, and tell them, `The kingdom of God has come near to you.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But into whatever city you enter, and they don`t receive you, go out into the streets of it and say,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">`Even the dust from your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near to you.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said to them, "I saw Satan having fall like lightning from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Nevertheless, don`t rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, "I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Turning to the disciples, he said, "All things have been delivered to me from my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whoever the Son desires to reveal him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Turning to the disciples, he said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn`t see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn`t hear them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, "Teacher, what will I do to inherit eternal life?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He said to him, "You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, "Who is my neighbor?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus answered, "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, `Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He said, "He who showed mercy on him."     Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">It happened as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus` feet, and heard his word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, "Lord, don`t you care that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">but one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened, that when he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said to them, "When you pray, say, `Our Father in heaven, May your name be kept holy. May your kingdom come. May your desire be done on Earth, as it is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Give us day by day our daily bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who       is indebted to us. Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He said to them, "Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell him, `Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and he from within will answer and say, `Don`t bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I can`t get up and give it to you`?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he won`t give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Or if he asks for an egg, he won`t give him a scorpion, will he?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. It happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? Because you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore will they be your judges.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come to you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">It came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But he said, "On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say, "This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the prophet.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I tell you, my friends, don`t be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But I will warn you whom you shall fear. Fear him, who after he has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Aren`t five sparrows sold for two assaria? Not one of them is forgotten by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore don`t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don`t be anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">One of the multitude said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But he said to him, "Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said to them, "Beware! Keep yourselves from covetousness, for a man`s life doesn`t consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He spoke a parable to them, saying, "The ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He reasoned within himself, saying, `What will I do, because I don`t have room to store my crops?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, `This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I will tell my soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be merry."`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But God said to him, `You foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you have prepared -- whose will they be?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He said to his disciples, "Therefore I tell you, don`t be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Life is more than food, and the body than clothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Consider the ravens: they don`t sow, they don`t reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If then you aren`t able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Consider the lilies, how they grow. They don`t toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Don`t seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Yet seek God`s kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Don`t be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father`s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Sell that which you have, and give alms. Make for yourselves purses which don`t grow old, a treasure in the heavens that doesn`t fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Be like men looking for their lord, when he will return from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Blessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Most assuredly I tell you, that he will gird himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don`t expect him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Peter said to him, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Truly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But if that servant says in his heart, `My lord delays his coming,` and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn`t expecting him, and in an hour that he doesn`t know, and will cut him apart, and place his portion with the unfaithful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">That servant, who knew his lord`s will, and didn`t prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">but he who didn`t know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whoever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom they deposit much, of him will they ask more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">"I came to throw fire on the earth, I wish it were already kindled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">For from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her mother in law."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">He said to the multitudes also, "When you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, `A shower is coming,` and so it happens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">When a south wind blows, you say, `There will be a scorching heat,` and it happens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you don`t interpret this time?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Why don`t you judge for yourselves what is right?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">For as you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be freed from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">I tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you have paid the very last lepton."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus answered them, "Do you think that these Galilaeans were worse sinners than all the other Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He spoke this parable. "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He said to the vine dresser, `Behold, these three years I came seeking fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He answered, `Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way lift herself up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your infirmity."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and glorified God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The ruler of the synagogue, being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, answered to the multitude, "There are six days in which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore the Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn`t each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away to water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, to have been freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">As he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, "To what is the kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and threw into his own garden. It grew, and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in the branches of it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Again he said, "What shall I compare to the kingdom of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three sata of flour, until it was all leavened."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">One said to him, "Lord, are they few who are saved?"     He said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">"Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, `Lord, Lord, open to us!` then he will answer and tell you, `I don`t know you or where you come from.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then you will begin to say, `We ate and drink in your presence, and you taught in our streets.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He will say, `I tell you, I don`t know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Behold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">On that same day, some Pharisees came, saying to him, "Get out of here, and go away, for Herod wants to kill you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, `Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can`t be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you refused!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Behold, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, `Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!`"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But they were silent.     He took him, and healed him, and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He answered them, "Which of you, if your son or an ox fell into a well, wouldn`t immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They couldn`t answer him regarding these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don`t sit in the best seat, since perhaps a more honorable man than you might be invited by him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and he who invited both of you would come and tell you, `Make room for this man.` Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell you, `Friend, move up higher.` Then you will have glory in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He also said to the one who had invited him, "When you make a dinner or a supper, don`t call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay you back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and you will be blessed, because they don`t have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, "Blessed is he who will feast in the kingdom of God!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But he said to him, "A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, `Come, for everything is ready now.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They all as one began to make excuses. The first said to him, `I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Another said, `I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Another said, `I have married a wife, and therefore I can`t come.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">That servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, `Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The servant said, `Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The lord said to the servant, `Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now great multitudes went with him. He turned and said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">"If any man comes to me, and doesn`t hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he can`t be my disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Whoever doesn`t bear his own cross, and come after me, can`t be my disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doesn`t first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Or perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">saying, `This man began to build, and wasn`t able to finish.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So therefore whoever of you who doesn`t renounce all that he has, he can`t be my disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Salt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, "This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He told them this parable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">"Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn`t leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, `Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Or what woman, if she had ten drachma coins, if she lost one drachma, wouldn`t light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, `Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Even so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He said, "A certain man had two sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The younger of them said to his father, `Father, give me my share of your property.` He divided his living to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Not many days after, the younger son gathered all of this together and took his journey into a far country. There he wasted his property with riotous living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But when he came to himself he said, `How many hired servants of my father`s have bread enough to spare, and I`m dying with hunger!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I will get up and go to my father, and will tell him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants."`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He arose, and came to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The son said to him, `Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no more worthy to be called your son.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the father said to his servants, `Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat, and celebrate;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.` They began to be merry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now his elder son was in the field. As he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He said to him, `Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him safe and sound.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he answered his father, `Behold, these many years I served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, and you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But when this, your son, came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He said to him, `Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.`"</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">He said also to his disciples, "There was a certain rich man, who had a manager. The same was accused to him of wasting his possessions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He called him, and said to him, `What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The steward said within himself, `What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I don`t have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Calling each one of his lord`s debtors to him, he said to the first, `How much do you owe to my lord?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He said, `A hundred batos of oil.` He said to him, `Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then said he to another, `How much do you owe?` He said, `A hundred cors of wheat.` He said to him, `Take your bill, and write eighty.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">His lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely, for the sons of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the sons of the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much. He who is unrighteous in a very little is also unrighteous in much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If you have not been faithful in that which is another`s, who will give you that which is your own?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You aren`t able to serve God and mammon."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said to them, "You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">He saw a certain poor widow casting in two lepta.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance, but she, out of her lack, put in all that she had to live on."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"As for these things which you see, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They asked him, "Teacher, when therefore will these things be? What is the sign that these things are about to happen?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said, "Watch out that you don`t get led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, `I AM,` and, `The time is at hand.` Therefore don`t follow them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When you hear of wars and disturbances, don`t be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end won`t come immediately."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be terrors and great signs from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name`s sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">It will turn out as a testimony to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But you will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. Some of you will they cause to be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You will be hated by all men for my name`s sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Not a hair of your head will perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">By your endurance you will win your souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let them who are in the midst of her depart. Don`t let those who are in the country enter therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land, and wrath to this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He told them a parable. "See the fig tree, and all the trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When they are already budding, you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Even so you also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Most assuredly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">"So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Therefore be watchful all the time, asking that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple, and every night he went out, and spent the night on the mountain that is called Olivet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">All the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the feast of unleavened bread drew near, which is called the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, being numbered with the twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They were glad, and agreed to give him money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Tell the master of the house, `The Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They went, found things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, "Take this, and share it among yourselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God comes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He took the cup in like manner after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, that which is poured out for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They began to question among themselves, which of them it was that would do this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called `benefactors.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the lesser, and one who is governing, as one who serves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn`t it he who sits at the table? But I am in the midst of you as one who serves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But you are those who have continued with me in my temptations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I appoint to you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed to me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Lord said, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn`t fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He said, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today, before you deny that you know me three times."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He said to them, "When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?"     They said, "Nothing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then he said to them, "But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: `He was counted with the lawless.` For that which concerns me has an end."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">They said, "Lord, behold, here are two swords."     He said to them, "That is enough."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When he was at the place, he said to them, "Pray that you don`t enter into temptation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He was withdrawn from them about a stone`s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">saying, "Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">and said to them, "Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went in front of them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">But Jesus said to him, "Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">But Jesus answered, "Let me at least do this" -- and he touched his ear, and healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn`t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest`s house. But Peter followed from a distance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">When they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, "This man also was with him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">He denied Jesus, saying, "Woman, I don`t know him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">After a little while someone else saw him, and said, "You also are one of them!" But Peter answered, "Man, I am not!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, "Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">But Peter said, "Man, I don`t know what you are talking about!" Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. Peter remembered the Lord`s word, how he said to him, "Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">He went out, and wept bitterly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, "Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">"If you are the Christ, tell us."     But he said to them, "If I tell you, you won`t believe,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">They all said, "Are you then the Son of God?"     He said to them, "You say it, because I AM."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">They said, "Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"     He answered him, "So you say."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find no basis for a charge against this man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he found out that he was in Herod`s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and said to them, "You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I will therefore chastise him and release him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But they all cried out together, saying, "Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!" --</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Pilate spoke to them again, desiring to release Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He said to them the third time, "Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Pilate adjudged that what they asked for should be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Jesus, turning to them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, don`t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, `Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then will they begin to tell the mountains, `Fall on us!` and to the hills, `Cover us.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they don`t know what they are doing."     Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, "If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Don`t you even fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He said to him, "Most assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!" Having said this, he breathed his last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned beating their breasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood far away, watching these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for the kingdom of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus` body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no man had ever yet lain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was coming on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They entered in, and didn`t find the Lord Jesus` body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It happened, while they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth.     They said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He isn`t here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They remembered his words,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn`t believe them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It happened, while they talked and questioned together, that Jesus himself came near, and went with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He said to them, "What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only one travelling in Jerusalem who doesn`t know the things which have happened there in these days?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He said to them, "What things?"     They said to him, "The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But we hoped that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and when they didn`t find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they didn`t see him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said to them, "Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Didn`t the Christ have to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They drew near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They urged him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over."     He went in to stay with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">It happened, when he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They said one to another, "Wasn`t our heart burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the scriptures to us?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">As they said these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, "Peace be to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they saw a spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He said to them, "Why are you troubled? Why do questionings arise in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn`t have flesh and bones, as you see that I have."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">While they still didn`t believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He took it, and ate in front of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">He said to them, "This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the scriptures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">You are witnesses of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Behold, I send forth the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">He led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">It happened, while he blessed them, that he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">They worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="43" bname="John" bsname="John">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The same was in the beginning with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn`t overcome it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn`t recognize him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came to his own, and those who were his own didn`t receive him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God`s children, to those who believe in his name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">John testified about him. He cried out, saying, "This was he of whom I said, `He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No one has seen God at any time. The only conceived Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This is John`s testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He confessed, and didn`t deny, but he confessed, "I am not the Christ."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?"     He said, "I am not."     "Are you the prophet?"     He answered, "No."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They said therefore to him, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, `Make straight the way of the Lord,` as Isaiah the prophet said."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They asked him, "Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered them, "I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don`t know,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">he who comes after me, whose sandal strap I`m not worthy to untie."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">On the next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This is he of whom I said, `After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I didn`t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">John testified, saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">I didn`t recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, `On whoever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Again, on the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, "What are you looking for?"     They said to him, "Rabbi" (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), "where are you staying?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He said to them, "Come, and see."     They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">One of the two who heard John, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter`s brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah!" (which is, being interpreted, Christ).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, "You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas" (which is by interpretation, Peter).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">On the next day, he was determined to go forth into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him, "Follow me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, "We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?"     Philip said to him, "Come and see."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael says to him, "How do you know me?"     Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered him, "Because I told you, `I saw you underneath the fig tree,` do you believe? You will see greater things than these."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He said to him, "Most assuredly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus` mother was there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When the wine ran out, Jesus` Mother said to him, "They have no wine."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews` manner of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said to them, "Fill the water pots with water." They filled them up to the brim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said to them, "Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast." They took it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn`t know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory. His disciples believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and there they stayed not many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers` money, and overthrew their tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To those who sold the doves, he said, "Take these things out of here! Don`t make my Father`s house a marketplace!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will eat me up."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Jews therefore answered him, "What sign do you show to us, seeing that you do these things?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The Jews therefore said, "Forty-six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he spoke of the temple of his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus didn`t trust himself to them, because he knew all people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and because he didn`t need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The same came to him by night, and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered him, "Most assuredly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he can`t see the kingdom of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother`s womb, and be born?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered, "Most assuredly I tell you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he can`t enter into the kingdom of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Don`t marvel that I said to you, `You must be born anew.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don`t know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nicodemus answered him, "How can these things be?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and don`t understand these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Most assuredly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you don`t receive our witness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If I told you earthly things and you don`t believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For God didn`t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn`t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only born Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn`t come to the light, for fear that his works would be reproved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done with God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them, and baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For John was not yet thrown into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John`s disciples with some Jews about purification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They came to John, and said to him, "Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">John answered, "A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">You yourselves testify about me, that I said, `I am not the Christ,` but, `I have been sent before him.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom`s voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He must increase, but I must decrease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the Earth belongs to the Earth, and speaks of the Earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He who believes in the Son has eternal life, but he who disobeys the Son won`t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(although Jesus himself didn`t baptize, but his disciples),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He needed to pass through Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jacob`s well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, "How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, `Give me a drink,` you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From where then have you that living water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his sons, and his cattle?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I don`t get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The woman answered, "I have no husband."     Jesus said to her, "You said well, `I have no husband,`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You worship that which you don`t know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God is a Spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah comes," (he who is called Christ). "When he has come, he will declare to us all things."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you am he."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">At this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, "What are you looking for?" or, "Why do you speak with her?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">"Come, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They went out of the city, and were coming to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you don`t know about."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The disciples therefore said one to another, "Has anyone brought him something to eat?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Don`t you say, `There are yet four months until the harvest?` Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white already to harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For in this the saying is true, `One sows, and another reaps.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">I sent you to reap that for which you haven`t labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, `He told me everything that I did."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Many more believed because of his word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">After the two days he went forth from there and went into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The nobleman said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus said to him, "Go your way. Your son lives." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying "your child lives!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son lives." He believed, as did his whole house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, "Bethesda," having five porches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he was afflicted with.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to be made well?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I`m coming, another steps down before me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus said to him, "Arise, take up your mat, and walk."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked.     Now it was the Sabbath on that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the Jews said to him who was cured, "It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry your mat."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, "He who made me well, the same said to me, `Take up your mat, and walk.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, `Take up your mat, and walk`?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he who was healed didn`t know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, "Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus answered them, "My Father is still working, so I am working, too."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus therefore answered them, "Most assuredly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For neither does the Father judge any man, but he has given all judgment to the Son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn`t honor the Son doesn`t honor the Father who sent him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Most assuredly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn`t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Most assuredly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God`s voice; and those who hear will live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Don`t marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and will come forth; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don`t seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">"If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">It is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He was the lamp that burns and shines, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father has sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">You don`t have his word living in you; for whom he sent, him you don`t believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">You search the scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">I don`t receive glory from men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But I know you, that you don`t have God`s love in yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">I have come in my Father`s name, and you don`t receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don`t seek the glory that comes from the only God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">"Don`t think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have set your hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">But if you don`t believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A great multitude followed him, because they saw the signs which he did on those who were sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip, "Where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter`s brother, said to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">"There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." Now there was much grass in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When they were filled, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, "This is truly the prophet who comes into the world."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain by himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But he said to them, "It is I. Don`t be afraid."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus hadn`t entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples went away alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn`t there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus answered them, "Most assuredly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Don`t work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For the Father, even God, has sealed him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They said therefore to him, "What must we do, that we may work the works of God?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They said therefore to him, "What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, `He gave them bread out of the sky to eat.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jesus therefore said to them, "Most assuredly, I tell you, it wasn`t Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They said therefore to him, "Lord, always give us this bread."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus said to them. "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But I told you that you have seen me, and yet don`t believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">All that which the Father gives me will come to me. Him who comes to me I will in no way throw out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">This is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all who he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise them up at the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, "I am the bread which came down out of heaven."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They said, "Isn`t this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say, `I have come down out of heaven?`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Therefore Jesus answered them, "Don`t murmur among yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">It is written in the prophets, `They will all be taught by God.` Everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Most assuredly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">I am the bread of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">I am the living bread which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Jesus therefore said to them, "Most assuredly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don`t have life in yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">This is the bread which came down out of heaven -- not as our fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, "This is a hard saying! Who can hear it?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">What if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">But there are some of you who don`t believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn`t believe, and who it was who would betray him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">He said, "For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me, except it be given to him by my Father."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Jesus said therefore to the twelve, "You don`t also want to go away, do you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">Jesus answered them, "Didn`t I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His brothers therefore said to him, "Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For no man does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For even his brothers didn`t believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus therefore said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The world can`t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, "Where is he?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others said, "Not so, but he leads the multitude astray."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Jews therefore marveled, saying, "How does this man know letters, having never been educated?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus therefore answered them, "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If anyone desires to do his will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I speak from myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Didn`t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The multitude answered, "You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus answered them, "I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Don`t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, "Isn`t this he whom they seek to kill?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don`t know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They sought therefore to take him. No one laid a hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the midst,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">they told him, "Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such. What then do you say about her?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of.     But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger, as if he didn`t hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up, and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the midst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus lifted himself up, and seeing no one but the woman, said to her, "Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">She said, "No one, Lord."     Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin no more."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">Jesus therefore said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then will you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me, I say these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He who sent me is with me. The Father hasn`t left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">As he spoke these things, many believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, "If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They answered him, "We are Abraham`s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to anyone. How do you say, `You will be made free?`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered them, "Most assuredly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">A bondservant doesn`t live in the house forever. A son remains forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">I know that you are Abraham`s seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">They answered him, "Our father is Abraham."     Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham`s children, you would do the works of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn`t do this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">You do the works of your father."     They said to him, "We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father, God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Therefore Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came forth and have come from God. For neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Why don`t you understand my speech? Because you can`t hear my word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">You are of your Father, the devil, and it is your desire to do the lusts of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn`t stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But because I tell the truth, you don`t believe me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">He who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you don`t hear, because you are not of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then the Jews answered him, "Don`t we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Jesus answered, "I don`t have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But I don`t seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Most assuredly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then the Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, `If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, `I don`t know him,` I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">The Jews therefore said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Jesus said to them, "Most assuredly, I tell you, before Abraham was born, I AM."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">They took up stones therefore to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">As he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents. But, that the works of God might be revealed in him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When I am in the world, I am the light of the world."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man`s eyes with the mud,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). So he went away, washed, and came seeing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind, before, said, "Isn`t this he who sat and begged?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Others said, "It is he." Still others said, "He is like him."     He said, "I am he."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They said therefore to him, "How were your eyes opened?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered, "A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, "Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash." So I went away and washed, and I received sight."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they asked him, "Where is he?"     He said, "I don`t know."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They brought him who before was blind to the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Some therefore of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, because he doesn`t keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?" There was division among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, in that he opened your eyes?"     He said, "He is a prophet."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">His parents answered them, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but how he now sees, we don`t know; or who opened his eyes, we don`t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore his parents said, "He is of age. Ask him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He therefore answered, "I don`t know if he is a sinner. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They said to him again, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He answered them, "I told you already, and you didn`t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They became abusive towards him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don`t know where he comes from."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The man answered them, "How amazing! You don`t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">We know that God doesn`t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They answered him, "You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?" They threw him out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He answered, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He said, "Lord, I believe!" and he worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, that those who don`t see may see; and that those who see may become blind."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, "Are we also blind?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, `We see.` Therefore your sin remains.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">"Most assuredly, I tell you, he who doesn`t enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don`t know the voice of strangers."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn`t understand what he was telling them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus therefore said to them again, "Most assuredly, I tell you, I am the sheep`s door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn`t listen to them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Many of them said, "He has a demon, and is mad! Why do you listen to him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Others said, "These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon`s porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Jews therefore came around him and said to him, "How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you don`t believe. The works that I do in my Father`s name, these testify about me.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, Lazarus, was sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, "Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when Jesus heard it, he said, "This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God`s Son may be glorified by it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed at that time two days in the place where he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then after this he said to the disciples, "Let`s go into Judea again."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The disciples told him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and are you going there again?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus answered, "Aren`t there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he doesn`t stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light isn`t in him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He said these things, and after that, he said to them, "Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The disciples therefore said to him, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So Jesus said to them plainly then, "Lazarus is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let`s go to him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, "Let`s go also, that we may die with him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn`t have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Even now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though he die, yet will he live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">She said to him, "Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God`s Son, he who comes into the world."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, "The Teacher is here, and is calling you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">She, when she heard this, arose quickly, and went to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb to weep there."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Mary therefore, when she came to where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn`t have died."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">and said, "Where have you laid him?"     They told him, "Lord, come and see."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The Jews therefore said, "See how much affection he had for him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Some of them said, "Couldn`t this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also caused that this man wouldn`t die?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, "Take away the stone."     Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, "Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus said to her, "Didn`t I tell you that if you believed, you would see God`s glory?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, "Father, I thank you that you listened to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.     Jesus said to them, "Free him, and let him go."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Therefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw that which Jesus did, believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, "What are we doing? For this man does many signs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">nor do you take account that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Now he didn`t say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover, to purify themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, "What do you think? Isn`t he coming to the feast?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So they made him a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Mary, therefore, took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Judas Iscariot, Simon`s son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"Why wasn`t this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For you always have the poor with you, but you don`t always have me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesus` sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the chief priests conspired to also put Lazarus to death,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, "Lord, do you wash my feet?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus answered him, "You don`t know what I am doing now, but you will understand later."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often resorted there with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Judas then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming on him, went forth, and said to them, "Who are you looking for?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth."     Jesus said to them, "I AM."     Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore he said to them, "I AM," they went backward, and fell to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Again therefore he asked them, "Who are you looking for?"     They said, "Jesus of Nazareth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus answered, "I told you that I AM. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, "Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest`s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant`s name was Malchus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus therefore said to Peter, "Put up the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it was Caiaphas who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, "Are you also one of this man`s disciples?"     He said, "I am not."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered him, "I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing in secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things which I said."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When he had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand, saying, "Do you answer the high priest like that?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, "Are you also one of his disciples?"     He denied it, and said, "I am not."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter cut off, said, "Didn`t I see you in the garden with him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Peter therefore denied again, and immediately the rooster crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didn`t enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, "What accusation do you bring against this man?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They answered him, "If this man weren`t an evildoer, we wouldn`t have delivered him up to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Pilate therefore said to them, "Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law."     Therefore the Jews said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered him, "Do you say this of yourself, or did others tell it to you concerning me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldn`t be delivered to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Pilate therefore said to him, "Are you a king then?"     Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pilate said to him, "What is truth?"     When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, "I find no basis for a charge against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But you have a custom, that I should release to you one at the Passover. Therefore do you desire that I release to you the King of the Jews?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then they all cried out again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and flogged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and they struck him with their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, "Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, "Behold, the man!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, "Crucify! Crucify!"     Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Pilate therefore said to him, "Aren`t you speaking to me? Don`t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered, "You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">At this, Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you release this man, you aren`t Caesar`s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called "The Pavement," but in Hebrew, "Gabbatha."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it was the Preparation of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, "Behold, your King!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They cried out, "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!"     Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?"     The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called "The place of a skull," which is called in Hebrew, "Golgotha,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, "Don`t write, `The King of the Jews,` but that, `he said, I am King of the Jews.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then they said to one another, "Let`s not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it will be," that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, "They parted my garments among them, For my cloak they cast lots."     Therefore the soldiers did these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother`s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold your son!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I am thirsty."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished." He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation, so that the bodies wouldn`t remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn`t break his legs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you also may believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For these things happened, that the scripture might be fulfilled, "A bone of him will not be broken."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Again another scripture says, "They will look on him whom they pierced."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus` body. Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore, and took away his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Nicodemus also came, he who at first came to Jesus by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So they took Jesus` body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Then because of the Jews` Preparation (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came early, while it was yet dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">She ran therefore, and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don`t know where they have laid him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn`t enter in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and the cloth that was on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the other disciple also entered in therefore, who came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For as yet they didn`t know the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the disciples went away again to their own homes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They told her, "Woman, why are you weeping?"     She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don`t know where they have laid him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When she had said this, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and didn`t know that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?"     She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said to her, "Mary."     She turned herself, and said to him, "Rhabbouni!" which is to say, "Teacher!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said to her, "Don`t touch me, for I haven`t yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, "Peace be to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When he had said this, he showed to them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus therefore said to them again, "Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Whoever`s sins you forgive, they are forgiven to them. Whoever`s sins you retain, they are retained."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasn`t with them when Jesus came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The other disciples therefore said to him, "We have seen the Lord!"     But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">After eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the midst, and said, "Peace be to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to Thomas, "Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your hand, and put it into my side. Don`t be faithless, but believing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">but these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter said to them, "I`m going fishing."     They told him, "We are also coming with you." They immediately went forth, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didn`t know that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus therefore said to them, "Children, have you anything to eat?"     They answered him, "No."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some."     They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It`s the Lord!"     So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging the net full of fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish which you have just caught."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the net wasn`t torn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus said to them, "Come and eat breakfast."     None of the disciples dared inquire of him, "Who are you?" knowing that it was the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?"     He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you."     He said to him, "Feed my lambs."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He said to him again a second time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?"     He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you."     He said to him, "Tend my sheep."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He says to him the third time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?"     Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, "Do you have affection for me?" He said to him, "Lord, you know everything. You know that I have affection for you."     Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Most assuredly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you, and carry you where you don`t want to go."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him, "Follow me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus` breast at the supper and asked, "Lord, who is going to betray You?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, "Lord, and what will this man do?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus said to him, "If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">This saying therefore went forth among the brothers, that that disciple wouldn`t die. Yet Jesus didn`t say to him that he wouldn`t die, but, "If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">There are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself wouldn`t contain the books that would be written.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="44" bname="Acts" bsname="Acts">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The first book I wrote, Theophilus, concerned all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">until the day in which he was received up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">To these he also showed himself alive after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days, and spoke about God`s kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Being assembled together with them, he charged them, "Don`t depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For John indeed baptized with water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore, when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He said to them, "It isn`t for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within His own authority.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come on you. You will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">While they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white clothing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">who also said, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who was received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day`s journey away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When they had come in, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were staying; that is Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">All these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In these days, Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (and there was a multitude of persons gathered together, about one hundred twenty), and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"Brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">It became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called `Akeldama,` that is, `The field of blood.`</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all with one accord in one place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and it sat on each one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in his own language.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, "Behold, aren`t all these who speak Galileans?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">How do we hear, everyone in our own native language?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">They were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, "What does this mean?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Others, mocking, said, "They are filled with new wine."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them, "You men of Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For these aren`t drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only the third hour of the day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">It will be, that whoever will call on the name of the Lord       will be saved.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">"You men of Israel, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as you yourselves know,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was his soul left in Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This Jesus God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">"Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what will we do?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized, everyone of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">With many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then those who gladly received his word were baptized. There were added that day about three thousand souls.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">praising God, and having favor with all the people. The Lord added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A certain man who was lame from his mother`s womb was being carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of those who entered into the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Peter, fastening his eyes on him, with John, said, "Look at us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He listened to them, expecting to receive something from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but what I have, that I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise and walk!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He took him by the right hand, and raised him up. Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Leaping up, he stood, and began to walk. He entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All the people saw him walking and praising God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They recognized him, that it was he who sat begging for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As the lame man who was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon`s, greatly wondering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When Peter saw it, he answered to the people, "You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this man? Why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">whom the heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, whereof God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from ancient times.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">It will be, that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">As they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">being upset because they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It happened in the morning, that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Annas the high priest was there, with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were relatives of the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When they had stood them in the midst, they inquired, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">if we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in him does this man stand here before you whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He is `the stone which was regarded as worthless by you, the builders, which was made the head of the corner.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There is salvation in none other, for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, in which we must be saved!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled. They recognized that they had been with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">saying, "What will we do to these men? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we can`t deny it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But so that this spreads no further among the people, let`s threaten them, that from now on they don`t speak to anyone in this name."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">for we can`t help telling the things which we saw and heard."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for everyone glorified God for that which was done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was performed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, "O Lord, you are God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">who by the mouth of your servant, David, said, `Why do the nations rage,    And the peoples plot a vain thing?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">For truly, in this city against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were gathered together. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul. Not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things common.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">With great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Great grace was on them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For neither was there among them any who lacked, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">While you kept it, didn`t it remain your own? After it was sold, wasn`t it in your power? How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You haven`t lied to men, but to God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and died. Great fear came on all who heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The young men arose and wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">About three hours later, his wife, not knowing what was had happened, came in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Peter answered her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much."     She said, "Yes, for so much."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Peter asked her, "How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">She fell down immediately at his feet, and died. The young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Great fear came on the whole assembly, and on all who heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">By the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. They were all with one accord in Solomon`s porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">None of the rest dared to join them, however the people honored them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">More believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on cots and mattresses, so that as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were tormented by unclean spirits: and they were all healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public custody.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night, and brought them out, and said,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">One came and told them, "Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then the captain went with the officers, and brought them without violence, for they were afraid that the people might stone them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When they had brought them, they set them before the council. The high priest questioned them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">saying, "Didn`t we strictly charge you not to teach in this name? Behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man`s blood on us."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it, and you would be found even to be fighting against God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They agreed with him. When they had called the apostles to them, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">He became hungry, and desired to eat, but while they were preparing, he fell into a trance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He saw heaven opened, and a certain container descending to him, like a great sheet, let down by four corners on the earth,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">A voice came to him, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat!"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Cornelius said, "Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour, and at the ninth hour, I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="44">While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">They of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For they heard them speak with other languages, and magnify God.     Then Peter answered,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">"Can any man forbid the water, that these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized,?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay some days.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When Peter had come up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">saying, "You went in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Peter began, and explained to them in order, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain container descending, like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. It came as far as me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">on which, when I had looked intently, I considered, and saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I also heard a voice saying to me, `Rise, Peter, kill and eat!`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I said, `Not so, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But a voice answered me the second time out of heaven, `What God has cleansed, don`t you make unholy.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Behold, immediately three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Spirit told me to go with them, without discriminating. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered into the man`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying to him, `Send to Joppa, and get Simon, whose surname is Peter,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">who will speak to you words whereby you will be saved, you and all your house.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, `John indeed baptized with water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If then God gave to them the same gift as us, when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, "Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except only to Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The report concerning them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem. They sent forth Barnabas to go as far as Antioch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">who, when he had come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad. He exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would remain near to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Barnabas went forth to Tarsus to look for Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. It happened, that even for a whole year they were gathered together with the assembly, and taught many people. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now in these days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">One of them named Agabus stood up, and indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over all the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The disciples, as anyone had plenty, each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">which they also did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now about that time, Herod the king put forth his hands to oppress some of the assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He killed James, the brother of John, with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This was during the days of unleavened bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When he had captured him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Peter therefore was kept in the prison, but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The same night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. Guards in front of the door kept the prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side, and woke him up, saying, "Stand up quickly!" His chains fell off from his hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The angel said to him, "Put on your clothes, and tie on your sandals." He did so. He said to him, "Wrap your cloak around you, and follow me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He went out, and followed him. He didn`t know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself. They went out, and passed on through one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When Peter had come to himself, he said, "Now I truly know that the Lord has sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from everything the Jewish people were expecting."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Thinking about that, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When she recognized Peter`s voice, she didn`t open the gate for joy, but ran in, and reported that Peter stood before the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They said to her, "You are crazy!" But she insisted that it was so. They said, "It is his angel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Peter continued knocking. When they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But he, beckoning to them with his hand to be silent, declared to them how the Lord had brought him forth out of the prison. He said, "Tell these things to James, and to the brothers." He departed, and went to another place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When Herod had sought for him, and didn`t find him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. He went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now Herod was highly displeased with those of Tyre and Sidon. They came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus, the king`s chamberlain, their friend, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king`s country for food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">On an appointed day, Herod dressed himself in royal clothing, sat on the throne, and gave a speech to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The people shouted, "The voice of a god, and not of a man!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he didn`t give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms, and he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the word of God grew and multiplied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their service, also taking with them John whose surname was Mark.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">As they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, "Separate Barnabas and Saul for me, for the work to which I have called them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They had also John as their attendant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. The same called Barnabas and Saul to him, and sought to hear the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and said, "Full of all deceit and all cunning, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!"     Immediately there fell on him a mist and darkness. He went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, "Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they stayed as aliens in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them forth out of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For about the time of forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">After these things he gave them judges until Samuel, the prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Afterward they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, to whom he also testified, `I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">From this man`s seed, God has brought salvation to Israel according to his promise,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">before his coming, when John had first preached the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">As John was fulfilling his course, he said, `What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. But behold, there comes one after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, the word of this salvation is sent forth to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they didn`t know him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Though they found no cause of death, they still asked Pilate to have him killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When they had fulfilled all things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But God raised him from the dead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">We bring you good news of the promise made to the fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">that God has fulfilled the same to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second psalm, `You are my Son.    Today I have become your father.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">"Concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has spoken thus: `I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Therefore he says also in another psalm, `You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw decay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he whom God raised up saw no decay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Be it known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Beware therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken in the prophets:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">`Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish; For I work a work in your days, A work which you will in no way believe, if one declares it to you.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, "It was necessary that God`s word should be spoken to you first. Since indeed you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">For so has the Lord commanded us, saying, `I have set you as a light of the Gentiles,    That you should be for salvation to the uttermost parts of the       earth.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">As the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God. As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The Lord`s word was spread abroad throughout all the region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their borders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the disobedient Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the multitude of the city was divided. Part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When some of both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to insult them and to stone them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">they became aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the surrounding region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There they preached the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">At Lystra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother`s womb, who never had walked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He was listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet!" He leaped up and walked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They called Barnabas "Jupiter," and Paul "Mercury," because he was the chief speaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have made a sacrifice with the multitudes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang into the multitude, crying out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the sky and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Yet he didn`t leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Even saying these things, they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city. On the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When they had appointed elders for them in every assembly, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When they had arrived, and had gathered the assembly together, they reported all the things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They stayed there with the disciples for a long time.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers, "Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you can`t be saved."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small discord and discussion with them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas, and some others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They, being sent on their way by the assembly, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles. They caused great joy to all the brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all things that God had done with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When there had been much discussion, Peter rose up and said to them, "Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">God, who knows the heart, testified about them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just like he did to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now therefore why do you tempt God, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they are."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All the multitude kept silence, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">After they were silent, James answered, "Brothers, listen to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Simeon has reported how God first visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">This agrees with the words of the prophets. As it is written,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">`After these things I will return.    I will again build the tent of David, which has fallen.    I will again build its ruins. I will set it up:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">That the rest of men may seek after the Lord;    All the Gentiles who are called by my name, Says the Lord, who does all these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">All his works are known to God from eternity.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">"Therefore my judgment is that we don`t trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For Moses from generations of old has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They wrote these things by their hand:     "The apostles, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: greetings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, `You must be circumcised and keep the law,` to whom we gave no commandment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality, from which if you keep yourselves, it will be well with you. Farewell."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So, when they were sent off, they came to Antioch. Having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words, and strengthened them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">After they had spent some time there, they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">dummy verses inserted by amos</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let`s return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Barnabas planned to take John with them also, who was called Mark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Paul didn`t think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and didn`t go with them to do the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then there arose a sharp contention, so that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away to Cyprus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">but Paul chose Silas, and went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the assemblies.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">He came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess who believed; but his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul wanted to have him go forth with him, and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So the assemblies were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When they had come opposite Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit didn`t allow them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A vision appeared to Paul in the night. There was a man of Macedonia standing, begging him, and saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and from there to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a Roman colony. We were staying some days in this city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">On the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who worshipped God, heard us; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When she and her household were baptized, she begged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and stay." She urged us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The same, following after Paul and us, cried out, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This she did for many days. But Paul, becoming distressed, turned and said to the spirit, "I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" It came out that very hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, "These men, being Jews, are agitating our city,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them, and commanded them to be beaten with rods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">who, having received such a charge, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone`s bonds were loosened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The jailer, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, "Don`t harm yourself, for we are all here!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He called for lights and sprang in, and, fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your house."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized, he and all his household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, "Let those men go."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out, and go in peace."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly, without a trial, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison! Do they now release us secretly? No, most assuredly, but let them come themselves and bring us out!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and they came and begged them. When they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They went out of the prison, and entered into Lydia`s house. When they had seen the brothers, they comforted them, and departed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Paul, as was his custom, went in to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer, and to rise again from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas, of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the chief women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the disobedient Jews gathered some wicked men from the marketplace, and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them forth to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they didn`t find them, they dragged Jason and certain brothers before the rulers of the city, crying, "These who have turned the world upside down have come here also,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">whom Jason has received. These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Many of them therefore believed; also of the Greek women of honorable estate, and not a few men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also, they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the brothers immediately sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea, and Silas and Timothy still stayed there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he reasoned in the synagogue with Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also encountered him. Some said, "What does this babbler want to say?" Others said, "He seems to be advocating foreign demons," because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They took hold of him, and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For you bring certain strange things to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things mean."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, "You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: `TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.` What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">neither is he served by men`s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">that they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">`For in him we live, and move, and have our being.` As some of your own poets have said, `For we are also his offspring.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and device of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked. But now he commands that all men everywhere should repent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, "We want to hear you yet again concerning this."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Thus Paul went out from among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But certain men joined with him, and believed, among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, who had recently come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome. He came to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He departed there, and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshipped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, "Don`t be afraid, but speak and don`t be silent;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don`t want to be a judge of these matters."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He drove them from the judgment seat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. Gallio didn`t care about any of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Paul, having stayed after this yet many days, took his leave of the brothers, and sailed from there for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila with him. He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When they asked him to stay a longer time, he declined;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but taking his leave of them, and saying, "I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you if God wills," he set sail from Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Having spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in the scriptures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of God more accurately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he helped them much, who had believed through grace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for he powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?"     They said to him, "No, we did not so much as hear whether there is a Holy Spirit."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said, "Into what then were you baptized?"     They said, "Into John`s baptism."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Paul said, "John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, on Jesus."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with other languages, and prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They were about twelve men in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period of three months, reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This continued for the space of two years, so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">insomuch that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and the evil spirits went out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But some of the itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The evil spirit answered, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Many also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Not a few of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. They counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now after these things had ended, Paul determined in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, "Sirs, you know that by this business we have our wealth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">You see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing, and her majesty destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When they heard this they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul`s companions in travel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When Paul wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples didn`t allow him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most of them didn`t know why they had come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. Alexander beckoned with his hand, and would have made a defense to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, "You men of Ephesus, what man is there who doesn`t know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great goddess Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Seeing then that these things can`t be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him, have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them press charges against one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day`s riot, there being no cause. Concerning it, we wouldn`t be able to give an account of this commotion."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">When he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When he had gone through those parts, and had encouraged them with many words, he came into Greece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When he had spent three months there, and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These accompanied him as far as Asia: Sopater of Beroea; Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">On the first day of the week, when the disciples were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and continued his speech until midnight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">There were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window, weighed down with deep sleep. As Paul spoke still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, "Don`t be troubled, for his life is in him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When he had gone up, and had broken bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, he departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They brought the boy alive, and were not a little comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul, for he had so arranged, intending himself to go by land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Sailing from there, we came the following day opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium, and the day after we came to Miletus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders of the assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they had come to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">how I didn`t shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But these things don`t count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the gospel of the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">for I didn`t shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Men will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years I didn`t cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now, brothers, I entrust you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">I coveted no one`s silver, or gold, or clothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, `It is more blessed to give than to receive.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">When he had spoken these things, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They all wept a lot, and fell on Paul`s neck and kissed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. They brought him on his way to the ship.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload her cargo.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Having found disciples, we stayed there seven days. These said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When it happened that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey. They all, with wives and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city. Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After saying goodbye to each other, we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the brothers, and stayed with them one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">On the next day, we, who were Paul`s companions, departed, and came to Caesarea.     We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now this man had four virgin daughters, who prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As we stayed there some days, a certain prophet, named Agabus, came down from Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Coming to us, and taking Paul`s belt, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit: `So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When we heard these things, both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, "The Lord`s will be done."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">After these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we would stay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The day following, Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When he had greeted them, he reported one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">They, when they heard it, glorified God. They said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men who have a vow on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Take them, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual immorality."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">All the city was moved, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Immediately the doors were shut.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Immediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. They, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the commanding officer came near, arrested him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd. When he couldn`t find out the truth because of the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When he came to the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, "Away with him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, "May I say something to you?"     He said, "Do you know Greek?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Aren`t you then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But Paul said, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you, allow me to speak to the people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. When there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">"Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I now make to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were even more quiet. He said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as you all are this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify, from whom also I received letters to the brothers, and journeyed to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It happened that, as I made my journey, and came close to Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, `Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I answered, `Who are you, Lord?` He said to me, `I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they didn`t understand the voice of him who spoke to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I said, `What will I do, Lord?` The Lord said to me, `Arise, and go into Damascus. There you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When I couldn`t see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">One Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews who lived there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">came to me, and standing by me said to me, `Brother Saul, receive your sight!` In that very hour I looked up at him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said, `The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now why do you wait? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">It happened that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and saw him saying to me, `Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not receive testimony concerning me from you.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I said, `Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When the blood of Stephen, your witness, was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He said to me, `Depart, for I will send you forth far from here to the Gentiles.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They listened to him until he said that, then they lifted up their voice, and said, "Rid the earth of this fellow, for he isn`t fit to live!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As they cried out, and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust into the air,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">the commanding officer commanded him to be brought into the barracks, ordering him to be examined by scourging, that he might know for what crime they shouted against him like that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they had tied him up with thongs, Paul asked the centurion who stood by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and not found guilty?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the centurion heard it, he went to the commanding officer and told him, "Watch what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The commanding officer came and asked him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?"     He said, "Yes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The commanding officer answered, "I bought my citizenship for a great price."     Paul said, "But I was born a Roman."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him, and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman, because he had bound him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, looking steadfastly at the council, said, "Brothers, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The high priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said Paul to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and command me to be struck contrary to the law?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Those who stood by said, "Do you malign God`s high priest?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Paul said, "I didn`t know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, `You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, "Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he had said this, there arose an argument between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess all of these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and contended, saying, "We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or angel has spoken to him, let`s not fight against God!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The following night, the Lord stood by him, and said, "Cheer up, Paul, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must testify also at Rome."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When it was day, some of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, "We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore, you with the council inform the commanding officer that he should bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to judge his case more exactly. We are ready to kill him before he comes near."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Paul`s sister`s son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Paul summoned one of the centurions, and said, "Bring this young man to the commanding officer, for he has something to tell him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So he took him, and brought him to the commanding officer, and said, "Paul, the prisoner, called me to himself, and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to tell you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The commanding officer took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring down Paul tomorrow to the council, as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore don`t yield to them, for more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the commanding officer let the young man go, charging him, "Tell no one that you have told these things to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He called to himself two of the centurions, and said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears, at the third hour of the night."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He asked them to provide animals, that they might set Paul on one, and bring him safely to Felix, the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He wrote a letter like this:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">"Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">"This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came on them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought him down to their council.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I found him to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent him to you immediately, charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you. Farewell."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. When he understood that he was from Cilicia, he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">"I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive." He commanded that he be kept in Herod`s palace.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that excellent measures are coming to this nation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But, that I don`t delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He even tried to profane the temple. We arrested him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">empty verses content detected by amos</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, "Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In the temple they didn`t find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Nor can they prove to you the things whereof they now accuse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now after some years, I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">amid which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult. But certain Jews from Asia --</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, `Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, "When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, "Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will call you to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He hoped that way that money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore also he sent for him more often, and talked with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the high priest and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul, and they begged him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">asking a favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; plotting to kill him on the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">However Festus answered that Paul was kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart shortly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"Let them therefore," said he, "that are in power among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When he had stayed among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">while he said in his defense, "Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, "Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar`s judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if I have done wrong, and have committed anything worthy of death, I don`t refuse to die; but if none of those things is true that these accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when some days had passed, Agrippa, the King, and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and greeted Festus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul`s case before the King, saying, "There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for a sentence against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction, before the accused have met the accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When therefore they were come together here, I didn`t delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I should send him to Caesar."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Agrippa said to Festus, "I also would like to hear the man myself."     "Tomorrow," he said, "you will hear him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially before you, king Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have something to write.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against him."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Agrippa said to Paul, "You may speak for yourself."     Then Paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">"Indeed, all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">This I also did in Jerusalem. I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme. Being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"Whereupon as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">at noon, O King, I saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who traveled with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, `Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goad.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I said, `Who are you, Lord?` He said, `I am Jesus, whom you persecute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But arise, and stand on your feet, for to this end have I appeared to you, to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the things which I will reveal to you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">"Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but declared first to them of Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple, and tried to kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">how the Christ must suffer, and how he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">As he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are crazy! Your great learning is driving you insane!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But he said, "I am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but speak forth words of truth and soberness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For the king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Agrippa said to Paul, "With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Paul said, "I pray to God, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these bonds."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When they had withdrawn, they spoke one to another, saying, "This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Agrippa said to Festus, "This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The next day, we touched at Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us on board.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">With difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast had now already gone by, Paul admonished them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and said to them, "Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to put to sea from there, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a port of Crete, looking northeast and southeast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euroclydon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When the ship was caught, and couldn`t face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven along.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Running under the lee of a small island called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship. Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">On the third day, they threw out the ship`s tackle with their own hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days, and no small tempest pressed on us, all hope that we should be saved was now taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When they had been long without food, Paul stood up in the midst of them, and said, "Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For there stood by me this night an angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">saying, `Don`t be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore, sirs, cheer up! For I believe God, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But we must run aground on a certain island."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They took soundings, and found twenty fathoms. After a little while, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for daylight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">As the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these stay in the ship, you can`t be saved."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">While the day was coming on, Paul begged them all to take some food, saying, "This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Therefore I beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety; for there will not a hair perish from the head of any of you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it, and began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">We were in all in the ship two hundred seventy-six souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When it was day, they didn`t recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes. Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained immovable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The soldiers` counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go to the land;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and the rest, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. So it happened that they all escaped safely to the land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When we had escaped, then we knew that the island was called Malta.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The natives showed us no common kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, "No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has not allowed to live."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">However he shook off the creature into the fire, and wasn`t harmed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they were long in expectation and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and courteously entertained us three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery. Paul entered in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was "The Twin Brothers."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">where we found brothers, and were entreated to stay with them seven days. So we came to Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">It happened, that after three days Paul called together those who were the leaders of the Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, "I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For this cause therefore did I ask you to see and to speak with me. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They said to him, "We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But we desire to hear of you what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number. He explained to them, testifying about the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they didn`t agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word, "The Holy Spirit spoke well through Isaiah, the prophet, to our fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">saying, `Go to this people, and say, In hearing, you will hear, and will in no way understand. In seeing, you will see, and will in no way perceive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For this people`s heart has grown callous. Their ears are dull of hearing. Their eyes they have closed. Lest they should see with their eyes, Hear with their ears, Understand with their heart, Would turn again, And I would heal them.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">"Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles. They will also hear."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who went in to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hinderance.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">which he promised before through his prophets in the holy scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">through whom we received grace and apostleship, to obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name`s sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Among whom you are also called to be Jesus Christ`s.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">requesting, if by any means now at length I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that is, that I with you may be comforted in you, each of us by the other`s faith, both yours and mine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now I don`t desire to have you unaware, brothers, that often I planned to come to you, and was hindered so far, that I might have some fruit in you also, even as in the rest of the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation to everyone who believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For therein is revealed a righteousness of God from faith to faith. As it is written, "But the righteous shall live by faith."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hinder the truth in unrighteousness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">because that which is known by God is revealed in them, for God revealed it to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Because, knowing God, they didn`t glorify him as God, neither gave thanks, but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions. For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with those who practice them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore you are without excuse, man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Do you know this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But according to your hardness and impenitent heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruptibility, eternal life;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but to those who are self-seeking, and don`t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, on the Jew first, and also on the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But glory and honor and peace to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For there is no partiality with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For it isn`t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">(for when Gentiles who don`t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You therefore who teach another, don`t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn`t steal, do you steal?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You who say a man shouldn`t commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For "the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you," just as it is written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For circumcision indeed profits, if you be a doer of the law, but if you be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won`t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Won`t the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the profit of circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Much in every way! Because first of all, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith make of no effect the faithfulness of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Certainly not! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written, "That you might be justified in your words, And might prevail when you come into judgment."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Certainly not! For then how will God judge the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), "Let us do evil, that good may come?" Those who say so are justly condemned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way. For we previously charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As it is written, "There is no one righteous. No, not one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks after God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They have all turned aside. They have together become unprofitable. There is no one who does good, no, not, so much as one."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"Their throat is an open tomb. With their tongues they have used deceit."  "The poison of vipers is under their lips;"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"Their feet are swift to shed blood.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">"There is no fear of God before their eyes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight. For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe. For there is no distinction,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, has found according to the flesh?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For what does the scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now to him who works, the reward is not accounted as of grace, but as of debt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But to him who doesn`t work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might also be accounted to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father, Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">As it is written, "I have made you a father of many nations." This is before him whom he believed, God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">But the free gift isn`t like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The gift is not as through one who sinned: for the judgment came by one to condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">So then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For as through the one man`s disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one will many be made righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Or don`t you know, brothers (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What will we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! However, I wouldn`t have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn`t have known coveting, unless the law had said, "You shall not covet."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The commandment, which was to life, this I found to be to death;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Did then that which is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">I find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For I delight in God`s law after the inward man,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;" that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">that if you will confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the scripture says, "Whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For, "Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good things!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But they didn`t all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But I say, didn`t they hear? Yes, most assuredly, "Their sound went out into all the earth, Their words to the ends of the world."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I ask, didn`t Israel know? First Moses says, "I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, With a nation void of understanding I will make you angry."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Isaiah is very bold, and says, "I was found by those who didn`t seek me. I was revealed to those who didn`t ask for me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But as to Israel he says, "All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I ask then, Did God reject his people? Certainly not! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God didn`t reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don`t you know what the scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But how does God answer him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn`t obtain, but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">According as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">David says, "Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, A stumbling block, and a retribution to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. Bow down their back always."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? Certainly not! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For if the rejection of them [is] the reconciling of the world, what would the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root of the richness of the olive tree;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">don`t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who bear the root, but the root you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You will say then, "Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don`t be conceited, but fear;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">for if God didn`t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They also, if they don`t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For I don`t desire, brothers, to have you ignorant of this mystery, so that you won`t be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles have come in,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written, "There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, And he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This is my covenant to them, When I will take away their sins."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers` sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">"For who has known the mind of the Lord?    Or who has been his counselor?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">"Or who has first given to him,    And it will be repaid to him again?"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don`t know whether I baptized any other.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel -- not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ wouldn`t be made void.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer of this world? Hasn`t God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn`t know God, it was God`s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but we preach Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When I came to you, brothers, I didn`t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that your faith wouldn`t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we speak God`s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds to our glory,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Which things also we speak, not in words which man`s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Don`t defraud one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn`t tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world -- how she may please her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">This I say for your own profit; not that I may throw a snare on you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn`t sin. Let them marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, will do well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn`t give her in marriage will do better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">A wife is bound by law for so long time as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whoever she desires, only in the Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don`t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But be careful that by any means this liberty of yours doesn`t become a stumbling block to the weak.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don`t cause my brother to stumble.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren`t raised at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I die daily, by your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">If I fought with animals at Ephesus like men, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, then "let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Don`t be deceived! "Evil companionships corrupt good morals."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Wake up righteously, and don`t sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But some one will say, "How are the dead raised?" and, "With what kind of body do they come?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">That which you sow, you don`t sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">So also it is written, "The first man, Adam, became a living soul." The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">However that which is spiritual isn`t first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let`s also bear the image of the heavenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood can`t inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Behold, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen: "Death is       swallowed up in victory."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">"Death, where is your sting? Hades, where is your victory?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord`s work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the assembly of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who comforts us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which works in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the comfort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we don`t desire to have you uninformed, brothers, concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired even of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">who delivered us out of so great a death, and does deliver; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">you also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For we write no other things to you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">as also you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In this confidence, I was determined to come first to you, that you might have a second benefit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be sent forward by you on my journey to Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When I therefore was thus determined, did I show fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the "Yes, yes" and the "No, no?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But as God is faithful, our word toward you was not "Yes and no."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not "Yes and no," but in him is "Yes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For however many are the promises of God, in him is the "Yes." Therefore also through him is the "Amen," to the glory of God through us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">who also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But I call God for a witness to my soul, that I didn`t come to Corinth to spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy. For you stand firm in faith.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn`t have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is of you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn`t find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as do some, letters of commendation to you or from you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">being revealed that you are a letter of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Such confidence we have through Christ toward God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit. For the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if the service of death, written engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which was passing away:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">won`t rather service of the spirit be rather with more glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if the service of condemnation has glory, much rather does the service of righteousness exceed in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For most assuredly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if that which passes away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and not as Moses, who put a veil on his face, that the children of Israel wouldn`t look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But their minds were hardened, for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains, because in Christ in passes away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the Lord is the Spirita and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord, the Spirit.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we don`t faint.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man`s conscience in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we don`t preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus` sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Seeing it is God who said, "Light will shine out of darkness," who shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We are pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, yet not to despair;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">pursued, yet not forsaken; struck down, yet not destroyed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus` sake, that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then death works in us, but life in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, "I believed, and therefore I spoke." We also believe, and therefore also we speak;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore we don`t faint, but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">while we don`t look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For most assuredly in this we groan, longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For indeed we who are in this tent do groan, being burdened; not that we desire to be unclothed, but that we desire to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now he who made us for this very thing is God, who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">for we walk by faith, not by sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well pleasing to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to God; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For we are not commending ourselves to you again, but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf, that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance, and not in heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God. Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the love of Christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, they have become new.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us. We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Great is my boldness of speech toward you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For even when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side. Fightings were outside. Fear was inside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">For behold, this same thing, that you were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you. Yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So although I wrote to you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore we have been comforted. In our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf, I was not put to shame. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">His affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembers all of your obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For according to their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">begging us with much entreaty in regard to this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">This was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that you also abound in this grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I give a judgment in this: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do, but also to be willing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But now complete the doing also, that as there was the readiness to be willing, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you don`t have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but for equality. Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As it is written, "He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went forth to you of his own accord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is known through all the assemblies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us in concerning this bounty which is served by us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">We have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker toward you. As for our brothers, they are the messengers of the assemblies, the glory of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But I have sent the brothers, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect, that, even as I said, you may be prepared,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">so that I won`t by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) should be put to shame in this confident boasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Remember this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Yes, I beg you, that I may not, when present, show courage with the confidence with which I count to be bold against some, who count of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For though we walk in the flesh, we don`t wage war according to the flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be made full.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For, "His letters," they say, "are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us, which reach even to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we don`t stretch ourselves too much, as though we didn`t reach to you. For we came even as far as to you in the gospel of Christ,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">But "he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you do bear with me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But I am afraid that by any means, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For if he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different gospel, which you did not accept, you put up with that well enough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best apostles.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will also boast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For you bear with the foolish gladly, being wise.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don`t know, or whether out of the body, I don`t know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I don`t know; God knows),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I forbear, so that no man may account of me above that which he sees in me, or hears from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted excessively.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ`s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I have become foolish. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I behind the very best apostles, though I am nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn`t we walk in the same spirit? Didn`t we walk in the same steps?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don`t desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">This is the third time I am coming to you. "At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word established."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">seeing that you seek a proof of Christ that speaks in me; who toward you is not weak, but is powerful in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him through the power of God toward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Test your own selves, whether you are in the faith. Test your own selves. Or don`t you know as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you? Unless indeed you are reprobate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I hope that you will know that we aren`t reprobate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is honorable, though we are as reprobate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. This we also pray for, even your perfecting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not deal sharply when present, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for tearing down.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and there isn`t another gospel. Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn`t be a servant of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews` religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I advanced in the Jews` religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother`s womb, and called me through his grace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn`t immediately confer with flesh and blood,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I went up by revelation, and I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">But from those who were reputed to be important (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn`t show partiality to man) -- they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the gospel for the circumcision</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They only asked us to remember the poor -- which very thing I was also zealous to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For before some people came from James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy; so much that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when I saw that they didn`t walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, "If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"We, being Jews by nature, and not Gentile sinners,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through the faith of Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? God forbid!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I, through the law, died to the law, that I might live to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth among you as crucified?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I just want to learn this from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He therefore that supplies the Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Even as Abraham "believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you will all the nations be blessed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who doesn`t continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, "The righteous will live by faith."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The law is not of faith, but, "He that does them will live in them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Brothers, I speak like men. Though it is only a man`s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He doesn`t say, "To seeds," as of many, but as of one, "To your seed," which is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now I say this. A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most assuredly righteousness would have been of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the scriptures shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For you are all sons of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">If you are Christ`s, then you are Abraham`s seed, heirs according to promise.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elements of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born to a woman, born under the law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba! Father!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are no gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elements, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You observe days, months, seasons, and years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I am afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the gospel to you the first time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn`t despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What has become of the blessing you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They zealously seek you in no good way. No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don`t you listen to the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">However, the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it is written, "Rejoice, you barren who don`t bear. Break forth and shout, you that don`t travail. For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has the       husband."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">However what does the scripture say? "Throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore, brothers, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the free woman.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don`t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You are alienated from Christ, you desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This persuasion is not from him who calls you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A little yeast grows through the whole lump.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling-block of the cross has been removed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don`t use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don`t consume one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won`t fulfill the lust of the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other, that you may not do the things that you desire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">If we live by the Spirit, let`s also walk by the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Let`s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren`t tempted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Bear one another`s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For each man will bear his own burden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Don`t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that will he also reap.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don`t give up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For even they who receive circumcision don`t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As many as will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God`s Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God,    to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord, Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord, Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">having predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, -- in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God`s own possession, to the praise of his glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which you have toward all the saints,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">don`t cease to give thanks for you, making mention in my prayers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the assembly,</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">You were made alive when you were dead through your trespasses and sins,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace have you been saved),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">not of works, that no one would boast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared before that we would walk in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called "uncircumcision" by that which is called "circumcision," (in the flesh, made by hands);</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that you were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man of the two, making peace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He came and preached peace to you who were far off, and peace to those who were near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace to you, and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord, Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I thank my God whenever I remember you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers with me of grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Now I desire to have you know, brothers, that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the gospel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">so that my bonds became revealed in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who, existing in the form of God, didn`t consider it robbery to be equal with God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">that at the name of Jesus every knee would bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I yet more:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">However, what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yes most assuredly, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and count them nothing but refuse, that I may gain Christ</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who think about earthly things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">We always give thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We know, brothers loved by God, that you are chosen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and that our gospel came to you not in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance. You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For from you has sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith toward God has gone forth; so that we need not to say anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you; and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God,</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For you yourselves know, brothers, our visit to you hasn`t been found vain,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we grew bold in our God to tell you the gospel of God in much conflict.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deception.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who tests our hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness (God is witness),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">nor seeking glory from men (neither from you nor from others), when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we were gentle in the midst of you, as when a nurse cherishes her own children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Even so, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you had become very dear to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail. Working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You are witnesses with God, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As you know how we exhorted, comforted, and implored everyone of you, as a father does his own children,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">to the end that you should walk worthily of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you received from us the word of the message of God, you accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For you, brothers, became imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and didn`t please God, and are contrary to all men;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">that no one be moved by these afflictions. For you know that we are appointed to this task.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For most assuredly, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction, even as it happened, and you know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For this cause I also, when I couldn`t stand it any longer, sent that I might know your faith, for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor would have been in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Timothy came just now to us from you, and brought us glad news of your faith and love, and that you have good memories of us always, longing to see us, even as we also long to see you;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who don`t know God;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore he who rejects, doesn`t reject man, but God, who has also given his Holy Spirit to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But concerning brotherly love, you have no need that one write to you. For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, even as we charged you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we don`t want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you don`t grieve like the rest, who have no hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so those who have fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this we tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with God`s trumpet. The dead in Christ will rise first,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. So we will be with the Lord forever.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For when they are saying, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But you, brothers, aren`t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You are all sons of light, and sons of the day. We don`t belong to the night, nor to darkness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">so then let`s not sleep, as the rest do, but let us watch and be sober.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunken are drunken in the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For God didn`t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself made purification for our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">having become so much better than the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For to which of the angels did he say at any time,  "You are my Son, Today have I become your father?"     and again,  "I will be to him a Father, And he will be to me a Son?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When he again brings in the firstborn into the world he says, "Let all the angels of God worship him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Of the angels he says, "Who makes his angels winds, And his servants a flame a fire."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but of the Son he says, "Your throne, God, is forever and ever;    The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;    Therefore God, your God, has anointed you    With the oil of gladness above your fellows."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, "You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth.    The heavens are the works of your hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They will perish, but you continue.    They all will grow old like a garment does.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As a mantle you will roll them up.    And they will be changed. But you are the same.    Your years will not fail."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">how will we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation -- which at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders, and by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For he didn`t subject the world to come, whereof we speak, to angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But one has somewhere testified, saying, "What is man, that you think of him? Or the son of man, that you care for him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You made him a little lower than the angels; You crowned him with glory and honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You have put all things in subjection under his feet."     For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we don`t see all things subjected to him, yet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">saying, "I will declare your name to my brothers, In the midst of the congregation will I sing your praise."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Again, "I will put my trust in him." Again, "Behold, here am I and the children whom God has given me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For most assuredly, not to angels does he give help, but he gives help to the seed of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he who built the house has more honor than the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but Christ as a Son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says,  "Today if you will hear his voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Don`t harden your hearts, as in the provocation, Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Where your fathers tested me by proving me, And saw my works for forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore I was displeased with that generation, And said, `They always err in their heart, But they didn`t know my ways;`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As I swore in my wrath, `They will not enter into my rest.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there will be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called "today;" lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">while it is said, "Today if you will hear his voice, Don`t harden your hearts, as in the provocation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For who, when they heard, did provoke? No, didn`t all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">With whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">To whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps a promise being left of entering into his rest, anyone of you should seem to have come short of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as also they, but the word of hearing did not profit them, because it was not mixed with faith by those who heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, "As I swore in my wrath, They will not enter into my rest;"     although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For he has said somewhere about the seventh day like this, "God rested on the seventh day from all his works;"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and in this place again, "They will not enter into my rest."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein, and they to whom the good news were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said), "Today if you will hear his voice, Don`t harden your hearts."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we don`t have a high priest who can`t be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for timely help.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">No man takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So also Christ didn`t glorify himself to be made a high priest, but he who said to him, "You are my Son. Today I have become your father."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As he says also in another place, "You are a priest forever, After the order of Melchizedek."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Of whom we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For when by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But solid food is for full grown men, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on to perfection -- not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">This will we do, if God permits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it, and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near a curse, whose end is to be burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, though we speak like this,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name, in that you served to the saints, and still do serve them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that you won`t be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he swore by himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">saying, "Most surely I will bless you, and I will surely multiply you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Wherein God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">which we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest`s office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes of Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Here men who die receive tithes, but there one, of whom it is testified that he lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it have the people received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no man has given attendance at the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, as to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for it is testified, "You are a priest forever, According to the order of Melchizedek."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Inasmuch as it is not without the taking of an oath,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that says of him, "The Lord swore and will not change his mind,    `You are a priest forever,    According to the order of Melchizedek`".</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">By so much has Jesus become the collateral of a better covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from continuing by death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For such a high priest was fitting for us: holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">who doesn`t need, like those high priests, to daily offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the law appoints men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, appoints a Son, perfected forevermore.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tent, which the Lord pitched, not man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tent, for, "See," he said, "that you make all things according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For finding fault with them, he said, "Behold, the days come," says the Lord, "That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the       house of Judah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the       land of Egypt; For they didn`t continue in my covenant, And I disregarded them," says the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of       Israel. After those days," says the Lord; "I will put my laws into their mind, I will also write them on their heart. I will be to them a God, And they will be to me a people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They will not teach every man his fellow citizen, Every man his brother, saying, `Know the Lord,` For all will know me, From the least of them to the greatest of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness. I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In that he says, "A new covenant," he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now indeed even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For there was a tent prepared, the first, in which were the lampstand, the table, and the show bread; which is called the Holy Place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">After the second veil, the tent which is called the Holy of Holies,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron`s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we can`t now speak in detail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tent, accomplishing the services,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Holy Spirit is signifying this, that the way into the Holy Place has not yet been revealed, while the first tent is yet standing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">which is an illustration of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshipper perfect;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">being only (with meats and drinks and various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tent, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded toward you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Moreover he sprinkled the tent and all the vessels of the ministry in like manner with the blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, similar in pattern to the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Or else wouldn`t they have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But in those sacrifices there is a memory made of sins year by year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, "Sacrifice and offering you didn`t desire, But a body did you prepare for me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you had no       pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I said, `Behold, I have come (In the scroll of the book it       is written of me) To do your will, God.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Saying above, "Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn`t desire, neither had pleasure in them" (those which are offered according to the law),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">then has he said, "Behold, I have come to do your will." He takes away the first, that he may establish the second,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Every priest indeed stands day by day ministering and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">henceforth expecting until his enemies to be made the footstool of his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after he has said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"This is the covenant that I will make with them: `After those days,` says the Lord, `I will put my laws on their heart, I will also write them on their mind;`"     then,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">"I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and having a great priest over the house of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">let us draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">let us hold fast the confession of our hope unyieldingly. For he who promised is faithful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as you see the Day approaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">A man who has set at nothing Moses` law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">How much worse punishment, do you think, will he be judged worthy of, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For we know him who said, "Vengeance belongs to me," says the Lord, "I will repay." Again, "The Lord will judge his people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions; and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Therefore don`t throw away your boldness, which has a great reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For you need patience, so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">"For yet a very little while, He who comes will come, and will not wait.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But the righteous will live by faith. If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">By faith, Enoch was translated, so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God translated him. For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth formed out of water and amid water, by the word of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But don`t forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness; but is longsuffering towards us, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for these things, be diligent to be found in peace, without blemish and blameless in his sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">as also in all of his letters, speaking in them of these things. In those are some things hard to be understood, which the ignorant and unsettled twist, as they do also to the other scriptures, to their own destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand, beware lest, being carried away with the error of the wicked, you fall from your own steadfastness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in heaven for about half an hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel`s hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth. There followed thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were thrown on the earth. One third of the earth was burnt up, and one third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and one third of the creatures which were in the sea died, those who had life. One third of the ships were destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of the star is called "Wormwood." One third of the waters became wormwood. Many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn`t shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a great furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those men who don`t have God`s seal on their foreheads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They were given power not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In those days men will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like gold crowns, and their faces were like men`s faces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They had hair like women`s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails is their power to harm men for five months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is "Abaddon," but in Greek, he has the name "Apollyon."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes coming after this.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they would kill one third of mankind.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didn`t repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn`t worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then I stood on the sand of the sea. I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">One of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally. His fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled at the beast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They worshipped the dragon, because he gave his authority to the beast, and they worshipped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">A mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him. Authority to continue for forty-two months was given to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He opened his mouth for blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tent, those who dwell in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them. Authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation was given to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If anyone has an ear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">If anyone gathers into captivity, into captivity he goes. If anyone will kill with the sword, with the sword he must be killed. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He performs great signs, even making fire come down out of the sky on the earth in the sight of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He deceives my own people who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to do in front of the beast; saying to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who had the sword wound and lived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It was given to him to give breath to it, to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many as wouldn`t worship the image of the beast to be killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, to be given a mark on their right hand, or on their forehead;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and that no one would be able to buy or to sell, unless he has that mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">They sing something like a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. None could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed by Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a great voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Send forth your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The winepress was trodden outside of the city, and blood came out from the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand six hundred stadia.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them God`s wrath is finished.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God, the Almighty;    Righteous and true are your ways, you King of the nations.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and it became a harmful and evil sore on the men that had the mark of the beast, and that worshipped his image.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and it became blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I heard the angel of the waters saying, "You are righteous, who are and who were, you Holy One, because you judged this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. They deserve this."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I heard the altar saying, "Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given to him to scorch men with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Men were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues. They didn`t repent and give him glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was darkened. They gnawed their tongues because of the pain,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be made ready for the kings that come from the sunrise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, something like frogs;</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here. I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored animal, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean things of her sexual immorality,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and on her forehead a name written, "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The angel said to me, "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into destruction. Those who dwell on the earth will wonder, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast, how that he was, and is not, and will come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They are seven kings. Five have fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come. When he comes, he must continue a little while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings. They also will overcome who are with him, called and chosen and faithful."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said to me, "The waters which you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the prostitute, and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind, and to come to unity of mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, I saw another angel coming down out of the sky, having great authority. The earth was illuminated with his glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He cried with a mighty voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and has become a habitation of demons, and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality, the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">However much she glorified herself, and grew wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning. For she says in her heart, `I sit a queen, and am no widow, and will in no way see mourning.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore in one day her plagues will come: death, mourning, and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire; for the Lord God who has judged her is strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her, will weep and wail over her, when they look at the smoke of her burning,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">standing far away for the fear of her torment, saying, `Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For your judgment has come in one hour.`</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">saying, `Woe, woe, the great city, she who was dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For in an hour such great riches are made desolate.` Every shipmaster, and everyone who sails anywhere, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood far away,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning, saying, `What is like the great city?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, `Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her great wealth!` For in one hour is she made desolate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints, you apostles, and you prophets; for God has judged your judgment on her."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, "Thus with violence will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and will be found no more at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The voice of harpers and minstrels and flute players and trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you. No craftsman, of whatever craft, will be found any more at all in you. The sound of a mill will be heard no more at all in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you. The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you; for your merchants were the princes of the earth; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But for the cowardly, unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues came, and he spoke with me, saying, "Come here. I will show you the wife, the Lamb`s bride."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, as if it was a jasper stone, clear as crystal;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He who spoke with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city, its gates, and its walls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The city lies foursquare, and its length is as great as its breadth. He measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand stadia. Its length, breadth, and height are equal.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The city has no need for the sun, neither of the moon, to shine, for the very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Its gates will in no way be shut by day (for there will be no night there),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">There will in no way enter into it anything profane, or one who causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb`s book of life.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">He showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in the midst of its street. On this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">There will be no curse any more. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will serve him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">He said to me, "Don`t seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He who acts unjustly, let him act unjustly still. He who is filthy, let him be filthy still. He who is righteous, let him do righteousness still. He who is holy, let him be holy still."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"Behold, I come quickly. My reward is with me, to repay to each man according to his work.</VERS>
