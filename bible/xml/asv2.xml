    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; [But] the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">My son, hear the instruction of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If they say, Come with us, Let us lay wait for blood; Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those that go down into the pit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We shall find all precious substance; We shall fill our houses with spoil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">My son, walk not thou in the way with them; Refrain thy foot from their path:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk privily for their own lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wisdom crieth aloud in the street; She uttereth her voice in the broad places;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She crieth in the chief place of concourse; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she uttereth her words:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you; I will make known my words unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I also will laugh in [the day of] your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When your fear cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Jehovah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They would none of my counsel; They despised all my reproof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, And shall be quiet without fear of evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, And lay up my commandments with thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So as to incline thine ear unto wisdom, And apply thy heart to understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yea, if thou cry after discernment, And lift up thy voice for understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If thou seek her as silver, And search for her as for hid treasures:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, And find the knowledge of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For Jehovah giveth wisdom; Out of his mouth [cometh] knowledge and understanding:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; [He is] a shield to them that walk in integrity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That he may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of his saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, And equity, [yea], every good path.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Discretion shall watch over thee; Understanding shall keep thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">To deliver thee from the way of evil, From the men that speak perverse things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the perverseness of evil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Who are crooked in their ways, And wayward in their paths:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, Even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">That forsaketh the friend of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For her house inclineth unto death, And her paths unto the dead;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">None that go unto her return again, Neither do they attain unto the paths of life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the perfect shall remain in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, forget not my law; But let thy heart keep my commandments:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For length of days, and years of life, And peace, will they add to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let not kindness and truth forsake thee: Bind them about thy neck; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So shalt thou find favor and good understanding In the sight of God and man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Trust in Jehovah with all thy heart, And lean not upon thine own understanding:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will direct thy paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It will be health to thy navel, And marrow to thy bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Honor Jehovah with thy substance, And with the first-fruits of all thine increase:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats shall overflow with new wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My son, despise not the chastening of Jehovah; Neither be weary of his reproof:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For whom Jehovah loveth he reproveth; Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, And the man that getteth understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of       silver, And the profit thereof than fine gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">She is more precious than rubies: And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto       her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: And happy is every one that retaineth her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he established the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">By his knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So shall they be life unto thy soul, And grace to thy neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, And thy foot shall not stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For Jehovah will be thy confidence, And will keep thy foot from being taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, When it is in the power of thy hand to do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again, And to-morrow I will give; When thou hast it by thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Devise not evil against thy neighbor, Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Strive not with a man without cause, If he have done thee no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Envy thou not the man of violence, And choose none of his ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; But his friendship is with the upright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers; But he giveth grace unto the lowly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The wise shall inherit glory; But shame shall be the promotion of fools.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hear, [my] sons, the instruction of a father, And attend to know understanding:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I give you good doctrine; Forsake ye not my law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I was a son unto my father, Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he taught me, and said unto me: Let thy heart retain my words; Keep my commandments, and live;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Get wisdom, get understanding; Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee; Love her, and she will keep thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wisdom [is] the principal thing; [therefore] get wisdom; Yea, with all thy getting get understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Exalt her, and she will promote thee; She will bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace; A crown of beauty will she deliver to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; And the years of thy life shall be many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of uprightness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: Keep her; for she is thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Enter not into the path of the wicked, And walk not in the way of evil men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Avoid it, pass not by it; Turn from it, and pass on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For they sleep not, except they do evil; And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The way of the wicked is as darkness: They know not at what they stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My son, attend to my words; Incline thine ear unto my sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep them in the midst of thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For they are life unto those that find them, And health to all their flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Keep thy heart with all diligence; For out of it are the issues of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Put away from thee a wayward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let thine eyes look right on, And let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Make level the path of thy feet, And let all thy ways be established.</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, attend unto my wisdom; Incline thine ear to my understanding:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That thou mayest preserve discretion, And that thy lips may keep knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on Sheol;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So that she findeth not the level path of life: Her ways are unstable, [and] she knoweth [it] not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore, [my] sons, hearken unto me, And depart not from the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Remove thy way far from her, And come not nigh the door of her house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Lest thou give thine honor unto others, And thy years unto the cruel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, And thy labors [be] in the house of an alien,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And thou mourn at thy latter end, When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And say, How have I hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I was well-nigh in all evil In the midst of the assembly and congregation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, And running waters out of thine own well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Should thy springs be dispersed abroad, And streams of water in the streets?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Let them be for thyself alone, And not for strangers with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Let thy fountain be blessed; And rejoice in the wife of thy youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">[As] a loving hind and a pleasant doe, Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; And be thou ravished always with her love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a       strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah; And he maketh level all his paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked, And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He shall die for lack of instruction; And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor, If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor: Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, Nor slumber to thine eyelids;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand [of the hunter], And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Provideth her bread in the summer, And gathereth her food in the harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">[Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So shall thy poverty come as a robber, And thy want as an armed man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A worthless person, a man of iniquity, Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">That winketh with his eyes, that speaketh with his feet, That maketh signs with his fingers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In whose heart is perverseness, Who deviseth evil continually, Who soweth discord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There are six things which Jehovah hateth; Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">A heart that deviseth wicked purposes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">A false witness that uttereth lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My son, keep the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Bind them continually upon thy heart; Tie them about thy neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; When thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee; And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">To keep thee from the evil woman, From the flattery of the foreigner`s tongue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; Neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For on account of a harlot [a man is brought] to a piece       of bread; And the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Or can one walk upon hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So he that goeth in to his neighbor`s wife; Whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Men do not despise a thief, if he steal To satisfy himself when he is hungry:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; He shall give all the substance of his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of       understanding: He doeth it who would destroy his own soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Wounds and dishonor shall he get; And his reproach shall not be wiped away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For jealousy is the rage of a man; And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, keep my words, And lay up my commandments with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Keep my commandments and live; And my law as the apple of thine eye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Bind them upon thy fingers; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; And call understanding [thy] kinswoman:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That they may keep thee from the strange woman, From the foreigner that flattereth with her words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Passing through the street near her corner; And he went the way to her house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the middle of the night and in the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, behold, there met him a woman With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">She is clamorous and wilful; Her feet abide not in her house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lieth in wait at every corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So she caught him, and kissed him, [And] with an impudent face she said unto him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me; This day have I paid my vows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore came I forth to meet thee, Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with loves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the man is not at home; He is gone a long journey:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He hath taken a bag of money with him; He will come home at the full moon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield; With the flattering of her lips she forceth him along.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He goeth after her straightway, As an ox goeth to the slaughter, Or as [one in] fetters to the correction of the fool;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Till an arrow strike through his liver; As a bird hasteth to the snare, And knoweth not that it is for his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now therefore, [my] sons, hearken unto me, And attend to the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let not thy heart decline to her ways; Go not astray in her paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For she hath cast down many wounded: Yea, all her slain are a mighty host.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Her house is the way to Sheol, Going down to the chambers of death.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Doth not wisdom cry, And understanding put forth her voice?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">On the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she standeth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">O ye simple, understand prudence; And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips shall be right things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For my mouth shall utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared       unto it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling, And find out knowledge [and] discretion.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter [it]: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been long ago, in the ages which were before us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is no remembrance of the former [generations]; neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter [generations] that are to come, among those that shall come after.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I communed with mine own hear, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding [me] with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what [can] the man [do] that cometh after the king? [even] that which hath been done long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The wise man`s eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For all his days are [but] sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">There is nothing better for a man [than] that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For to the man that pleaseth him [God] giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">I said in my heart, [It is] because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are [but as] beasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now at that time the king of Babylon`s army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith Jehovah: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">So Hanamel mine uncle`s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle`s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, [according to] the law and custom, and that which was open:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle`s [son], and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">and they came in, and possessed it, but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Behold, the mounds, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And thou hast said unto me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For this city hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [the fire] unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And now therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For thus saith Jehovah: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her       cheeks; Among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are       become her enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and       because of great servitude; She dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest: All her persecutors overtook her within the straits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn       assembly; All her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh: Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper; For Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her       transgressions: Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed: Her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, And they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of       her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the       days of old: When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none       did help her, The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is become       as an unclean thing; All that honored her despise her, because they have seen her       nakedness: Yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered not her       latter end; Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she hath no comforter: Behold, O Jehovah, my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified       himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her       pleasant things: For she hath seen that the nations are entered into her       sanctuary, Concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter       into thine assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All her people sigh, they seek bread; They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the       soul: See, O Jehovah, and behold; for I am become abject.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow,       which is brought upon me, Wherewith Jehovah hath afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce       anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it       prevaileth against them; He hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: He hath made me desolate and faint all the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand; They are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath       made my strength to fail: The Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am       not able to stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the       midst of me; He hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young       men: The Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of       Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down       with water; Because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me: My children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled against his       commandment: Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow: My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I called for my lovers, [but] they deceived me: My priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, While they sought them food to refresh their souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Behold, O Jehovah; for I am in distress; my heart is       troubled; My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: Abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me; All mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that       thou hast done it: Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast proclaimed, and they       shall be like unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Let all their wickedness come before thee; And do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my       transgressions: For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a       cloud in his anger! He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of       Israel, And hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob,       and hath not pitied: He hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter       of Judah; He hath brought them down to the ground; he hath profaned the       kingdom and the princes thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel; He hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy: And he hath burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth       round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He hath bent his bow like an enemy, he hath stood with his       right hand as an adversary, And hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye: In the tent of the daughter of Zion he hath poured out his wrath       like fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The Lord is become as an enemy, he hath swallowed up       Israel; He hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath destroyed his       strongholds; And he hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and       lamentation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it       were of a garden; he hath destroyed his place of assembly: Jehovah hath caused solemn assembly and sabbath to be forgotten       in Zion, And hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and       the priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his       sanctuary; He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her       palaces: They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as in the day of       a solemn assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter       of Zion; He hath stretched out the line, he hath not withdrawn his hand       from destroying; And he hath made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish       together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and       broken her bars: Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is       not; Yea, her prophets find no vision from Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground,       they keep silence; They have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded       themselves with sackcloth: The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Mine eyes do fail with tears, my heart is troubled; My liver is poured upon the earth, because of the destruction of       the daughter of my people, Because the young children and the sucklings swoon in the       streets of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine? When they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city, When their soul is poured out into their mothers` bosom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">What shall I testify unto thee? what shall I liken to       thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin       daughter of Zion? For thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Thy prophets have seen for thee false and foolish visions; And they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring back thy       captivity, But have seen for thee false oracles and causes of banishment.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against       thee; They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her       up; Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we       have seen it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jehovah hath done that which he purposed; he hath       fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old; He hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: And he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath       exalted the horn of thine adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Their heart cried unto the Lord: O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river       day and night; Give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the       watches; Pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord: Lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children,       that faint for hunger at the head of every street.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">See, O Jehovah, and behold to whom thou hast done thus! Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled       in the hands? Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of       the Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the       streets; My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: Thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast       slaughtered, [and] not pitied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Thou hast called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my       terrors on every side; And there was none that escaped or remained in the day of       Jehovah`s anger: Those that I have dandled and brought up hath mine enemy       consumed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In the fifth [day] of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin`s captivity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst thereof as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf`s foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings [thus]:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And their faces and their wings were separate above; two [wings] of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: [the fire] went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto a beryl: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not when they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the terrible crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And [I heard] the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth [month], the tenth [day] of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">in that day I sware unto them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But I wrought for my name`s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomsoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">But if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king`s matter, forasmuch as no king, lord, or ruler, hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king`s guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">he answered and said to Arioch the king`s captain, Wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should nor perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom and might are his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">he revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of thee; for thou hast made known unto us the king`s matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show unto the king;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Thou, O king, sawest, and, behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the aspect thereof was terrible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Thou, O king, art king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all: thou art the head of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters` clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nebuchadnezzar answered and said unto them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, [well]: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If it be [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: [therefore] he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, [and] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore because the king`s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spake and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king`s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king`s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, [saying],</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and the height thereof was great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">let his heart be changed from man`s, and let a beast`s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the lowest of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken dumb for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, trouble thee.

      <VERS vnumber="20">The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles` [feathers], and his nails like birds` [claws].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the king should have no damage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault, forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counsellors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem) and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king`s interdict: Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save unto thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then these men assembled together unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. [Now] the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions` mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the king commanded, and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be even unto the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The first was like a lion, and had eagle`s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man`s heart was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, [and] the wheels thereof burning fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other [horn] which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable [horns] toward the four winds of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious [land].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual [burnt-offering], and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the host was given over [to it] together with the continual [burnt-offering] through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did [its pleasure] and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision [concerning] the continual [burnt-offering], and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I heard a man`s voice between [the banks of] the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do [his pleasure]; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in [their] security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days [to come].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king`s business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside, that they should not obey thy voice: therefore hath the curse been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He hath cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God; yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing grain; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein none delighteth.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for thou hast played the harlot, [departing] from thy God; thou hast loved hire upon every grain-floor.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">They shall not pour out wine-offerings to Jehovah, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Ephraim [was] a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowler`s snare is in all his ways, [and] enmity in the house of his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at its first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Jehovah sent out a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jehovah God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his evil case. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">For the priest`s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But ye are turned aside out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble in the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have had respect of persons in the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of Jehovah which he loveth, and hath married the daughter of a foreign god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jehovah will cut off, to the man that doeth this, him that waketh and him that answereth, out of the tents of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto Jehovah of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And this again ye do: ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, neither receiveth it with good will at your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because Jehovah hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously, though she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And did he not make one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? And wherefore one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For I hate putting away, saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, and him that covereth his garment with violence, saith Jehovah of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? In that ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and he delighteth in them; or where is the God of justice?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent by his disciples</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and said unto him, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye hear and see:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good tidings preached to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And as these went their way, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft [raiment]? Behold, they that wear soft [raiment] are in king`s houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But wherefore went ye out? to see a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way before thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and men of violence take it by force.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And if ye are willing to receive [it,] this is Elijah, that is to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces, who call unto their fellows</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not mourn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! And wisdom is justified by her works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades: for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee, it would have remained until this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">At that season Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">yea, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither doth any know the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal [him.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that season Jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">how he entered into the house of God, and ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I say unto you, that one greater than the temple is here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if ye had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he departed thence, and went into their synagogue:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and behold, a man having a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said unto them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jesus perceiving [it] withdrew from thence: and many followed him; and he healed them all,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and charged them that they should not make him known:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon him, And he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He shall not strive, nor cry aloud; Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">A bruised reed shall he not break, And smoking flax shall he not quench, Till he send forth judgment unto victory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And knowing their thoughts he said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Or how can one enter into the house of the strong [man,] and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong [man]? and then he will spoil his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore I say unto you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On that day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And there were gathered unto him great multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and as he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He that hath ears, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this people`s heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Hear then ye the parable of the sower.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, [then] cometh the evil [one], and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown by the way side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil [one];</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Is not this the carpenter`s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">At that season Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore do these powers work in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip`s wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And the disciples went, and did even as Jesus appointed them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and the rest laid hold on his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the king was wroth; and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when the king came in to behold the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For many are called, but few chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might ensnare him in [his] talk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for thou regardest not the person of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And when they heard it, they marvelled, and left him, and went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">On that day there came to him Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife unto his brother;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, trying him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">This is the great and first commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And a second like [unto it] is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">On these two commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">saying, What think ye of the Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, [The son] of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He saith unto them, How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For the foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For [it is] as [when] a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In like manner he also that [received] the two gained other two.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord`s money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he also that [received] the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, [even] these least, ye did it unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">for I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ye know that after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as he sat at meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For this [ointment] might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Jesus perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him [unto them.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now on the first [day] of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many unto remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But I say unto you, I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father`s kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, [yet] will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and elders of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus said unto him, Friend, [do] that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And they that had taken Jesus led him away to [the house of] Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">But Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And the high priest stood up, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And when he was gone out into the porch, another [maid] saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art [one] of them; for thy speech maketh thee known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when morning was come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">saying, I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? see thou [to it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter`s field, to bury strangers in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore that field was called, the field of blood, unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom [certain] of the children of Israel did price;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and they gave them for the potter`s field, as the Lord appointed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then saith Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But the governor answered and said unto them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate saith unto them, What then shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; see ye [to it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all the people answered and said, His blood [be] on us, and on our children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then released he unto them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered unto him the whole band.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And they spat upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go [with them], that he might bear his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">and they sat and watched him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then are there crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">In like manner also the chief priests mocking [him], with the scribes and elders, said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusteth on God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And some of them stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And many women were there beholding from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And when even was come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus` disciple:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Now on the morrow, which is [the day] after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said unto them, Ye have a guard: go, make it [as] sure as ye can.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now late on the sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; And they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And John was clothed with camel`s hair, and [had] a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I baptized you in water; But he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; And he was with the wild beasts; And the angels ministered unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And going on a little further, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they were astonished at his teaching: For he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now Simon`s wife`s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And all the city was gathered together at the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And they come, bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy, borne of four.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they could not come nigh unto him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Why doth this man thus speak? he blasphemeth: who can forgive sins but one, [even] God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And straightway Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, saith unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I say unto thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And he spake to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">even as they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was in the days of Herod, king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother`s womb.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he knew that he was of Herod`s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking [it] he gave to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they rehearsed the things [that happened] in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he took it, and ate before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Ye are witnesses of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And he led them out until [they were] over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and were continually in the temple, blessing God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The same was in the beginning with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He was not the light, but [came] that he might bear witness of the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There was the true light, [even the light] which lighteth every man, coming into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came unto his own, and they that were his own received him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God, [even] to them that believe on his name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become before me: for he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they had been sent from the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they asked him, and said unto him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">[even] he that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abideth thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">One of the two that heard John [speak], and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter`s brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and Jesus also was bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews` manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when [men] have drunk freely, [then] that which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and [his] brethren, and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers` money, and overthrew their tables;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and to them that sold the doves he said, Take these things hence; make not my Father`s house a house of merchandise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house shall eat me up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Jews therefore answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he spake of the temple of his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">the same came unto him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother`s womb, and be born?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven, [even] the Son of man, who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And John also was baptizing in Enon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For John was not yet cast into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John`s disciples with a Jew about purifying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they came unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom`s voice: this my joy therefore is made full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He must increase, but I must decrease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to [this], that God is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he must needs pass through Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Jacob`s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered and said unto unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am [he].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Come, see a man, who told me all things that [ever] I did: can this be the Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They went out of the city, and were coming to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him [aught] to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and [then] cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that [ever] I did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And many more believed because of his word;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought [him] that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep [gate] a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered, [waiting for the moving of the water.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">[for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole, with whatsoever disease he was holden.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time [in that case], he saith unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the sabbath on that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up [thy bed], and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh even until now, and I work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may marvel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Ye have sent unto John, and he hath borne witness unto the truth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But the witness which I have is greater than [that of] John; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, [even] Moses, on whom ye have set your hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">As he spake these things, many believed on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, [then] are ye truly my disciples;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">They answered unto him, We are Abraham`s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Why do ye not understand my speech? [Even] because ye cannot hear my word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="48">The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Judas then, having received the band [of soldiers], and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am [he]. And Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore he said unto them, I am [he], they went backward, and fell to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus answered, I told you that I am [he]; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">that the word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest`s servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant`s name was Malchus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and [so did] another disciple. Now that disciple was known unto the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">but Peter was standing at the door without. So the other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went out and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The maid therefore that kept the door saith unto Peter, Art thou also [one] of this man`s disciples? He saith, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the servants and the officers were standing [there], having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Why askest thou me? Ask them that have heard [me], what I spake unto them: behold, these know the things which I said.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Peter therefore denied again: and straightway the cock crew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves entered not into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Pilate therefore went out unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye against this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They answered and said unto him, If this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find no crime in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And [Pilate] saith unto them, Behold, the man!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify [him], crucify [him]! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and he entered into the Praetorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar`s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They therefore cried out, Away with [him], away with [him], crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, [and] in Latin, [and] in Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother`s sister, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own [home].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high [day]), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave [him] leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">There then because of the Jews` Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now on the first [day] of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">She runneth therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Simon Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and the napkin, that was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then entered in therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the disciples went away again unto their own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and [that] he had said these things unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first [day] of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace [be] unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace [be] unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach [hither] thy hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed [are] they that have not seen, and [yet] have believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested [himself] on this wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There was together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus therefore saith unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net [full] of fishes.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So when they had broken their fast, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He saith to him again a second time, Simon, [son] of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He saith unto him the third time, Simon, [son] of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee? Follow thou me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the high priest said, Are these things so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said, Brethren and fathers, hearken: The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and said unto him, Get thee out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, [God] removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: and he promised that he would give it to him in possession, and to his seed after him, when [as yet] he had no child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And God spake on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage, and treat them ill, four hundred years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so [Abraham] begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac [begat] Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God was with him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">and they were carried over unto Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">The same dealt craftily with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, that they should cast out their babes to the end they might not live.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They therefore that were scattered abroad, went about preaching the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For [from] many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there was much joy in that city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles` hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, So he openeth not his mouth:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached unto him Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, [here is] water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">[And Philip said, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.]</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he [said], I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but beholding no man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">and he hath seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, [even] Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way which thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and he took food and was strengthened. And he was certain days with the disciples that were at Damascus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And when he was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">He saw in a vision openly, as it were about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Now on the morrow, as they were on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">and he beholdeth the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The word which he sent unto the children of Israel, preaching good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all.) --</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">that saying ye yourselves know, which was published throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">[even] Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom also they slew, hanging him on a tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">not to all the people, but unto witnesses that were chosen before of God, [even] to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he charged us to preach unto the people, and to testify that this is he who is ordained of God [to be] the Judge of the living and the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">To him bear all the prophets witness, that through his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And they of the circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the apostles and the brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Peter began, and expounded [the matter] unto them in order, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even unto me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">upon which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw the fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I heard also a voice saying unto me, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this was done thrice: and all were drawn up again into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And behold, forthwith three men stood before the house in which we were, having been sent from Caesarea unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the Spirit bade me go with them, making no distinction. And these six brethren also accompanied me; and we entered into the man`s house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose surname is Peter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">who shall speak unto thee words, whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If then God gave unto them the like gift as [he did] also unto us, when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They therefore that were scattered abroad upon the tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none save only to Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number that believed turned unto the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas as far as Antioch:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">who, when he was come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad; and he exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he went forth to Tarsus to seek for Saul;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that even for a whole year they were gathered together with the church, and taught much people, and that the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now in these days there came down prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in Judea:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now about that time Herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. And [those] were the days of unleavened bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he had taken him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Peter therefore was kept in the prison: but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto God for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and guards before the door kept the prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell: and he smote Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he went out, and followed; and he knew not that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when they were past the first and the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and straightway the angel departed from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he had considered [the thing], he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together and were praying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a maid came to answer, named Rhoda.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when she knew Peter`s voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. And they said, It is his angel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him forth out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went to another place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and tarried there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now he was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: and they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king`s chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was fed from the king`s country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And upon a set day Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel, and sat on the throne, and made an oration unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the people shouted, [saying], The voice of a god, and not of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the word of God grew and multiplied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministration, taking with them John whose surname was Mark.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was [there], prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And as they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as their attendant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they had gone through the whole island unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. The same called unto him Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Saul, who is also [called] Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and said, O full of all guile and all villany, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm led he them forth out of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And for about the time of forty years as a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave [them] their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and after these things he gave [them] judges until Samuel the prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And afterward they asked for a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bare witness and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who shall do all My will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Of this man`s seed hath God according to promise brought unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, What suppose ye that I am? I am not [he]. But behold, there cometh one after me the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us is the word of this salvation sent forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For they that dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled [them] by condemning [him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And though they found no cause of death [in him], yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But God raised him from the dead:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he hath spoken on this wise, I will give you the holy and sure [blessings] of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Because he saith also in another [psalm], Thou wilt not give Thy Holy One to see corruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="42">And as they went out, they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Paul and Barnabas spake out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">For so hath the Lord commanded us, [saying], I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, That thou shouldest be for salvation unto the uttermost part of       the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="50">But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the Jews that were disobedient stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil affected against the brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Long time therefore they tarried [there] speaking boldly in the Lord, who bare witness unto the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the multitude of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when there was made an onset both of the Gentiles and of the Jews with their rulers, to treat them shamefully and to stone them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">they became aware of it, and fled unto the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the region round about:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and there they preached the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And at Lystra there sat a certain man, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother`s womb, who never had walked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The same heard Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And when the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the priest of Jupiter whose [temple] was before the city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the multitude, crying out</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good tidings, that ye should turn from these vain things unto a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And after they had spent some time [there], they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">[But it seemed good unto Silas to abide there.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the Lord, [and see] how they fare.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">but Paul choose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and from thence to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a [Roman] colony: and we were in this city tarrying certain days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide [there]. And she constrained us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one`s bands were loosed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the jailor reported the words to Paul, [saying], The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? Nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the sergeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And they went out of the prison, and entered into [the house] of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and Paul, as his custom was, went in unto them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">opening and alleging that it behooved the Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom, [said he,] I proclaim unto you, is the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas, and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the Jews, being moved with jealousy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and gathering a crowd, set the city on an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them forth to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they found them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">whom Jason hath received: and these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, [one] Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Beroea: who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Many of them therefore believed; also of the Greek women of honorable estate, and of men, not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed of Paul at Beroea also, they came thither likewise, stirring up and troubling the multitudes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea: and Silas and Timothy abode there still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld the city full of idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he reasoned in the synagogue with Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with them that met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What would this babbler say? others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they took hold of him, and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, Ye men of Athens, in all things, I perceive that ye are very religious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The God that made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">neither is he served by men`s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined [their] appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee concerning this yet again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Thus Paul went out from among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But certain men clave unto him, and believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things he departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: and he came unto them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and because he was of the same trade, he abode with them, and they wrought, for by their trade they were tentmakers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook out his raiment and said unto them, Your blood [be] upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he departed thence, and went into the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Lord said unto Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy peace:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to harm thee: for I have much people in this city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he dwelt [there] a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment-seat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">saying, This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked villany, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves; I am not minded to be a judge of these matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he drove them from the judgment-seat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they all laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Paul, having tarried after this yet many days, took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila: having shorn his head in Cenchreae; for he had a vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when they asked him to abide a longer time, he consented not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but taking his leave of them, and saying, I will return again unto you if God will, he set sail from Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having spent some time [there], he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the scriptures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more accurately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he was come, he helped them much that had believed through grace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for he powerfully confuted the Jews, [and that] publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and he said unto them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they [said] unto him, Nay, we did not so much as hear whether the Holy Spirit was [given].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John`s baptism.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him that should come after him, that is, on Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they were in all about twelve men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he entered into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading [as to] the things concerning the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this continued for the space of two years; so that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the evil spirits went out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the evil spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Many also of them that had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And not a few of them that practised magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So mightily grew the word of the Lord and prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now after these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And having sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And about that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought no little business unto the craftsmen;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this business we have our wealth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when they heard this they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the city was filled with the confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul`s companions in travel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when Paul was minded to enter in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent unto him and besought him not to adventure himself into the theatre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defense unto the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when the townclerk had quieted the multitude, he saith, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Diana, and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For ye have brought [hither] these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">If therefore Demetrius, and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if ye seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For indeed we are in danger to be accused concerning this day`s riot, there being no cause [for it]: and as touching it we shall not be able to give account of this concourse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after the uproar ceased, Paul having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he had gone through those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when he had spent three months [there,] and a plot was laid against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater of Beroea, [the son] of Pyrrhus; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But these had gone before, and were waiting for us at Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we tarried seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And upon the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the morrow; and prolonged his speech until midnight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there sat in the window a certain young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Make ye no ado; for his life is in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when he was gone up, and had broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they brought the lad alive, and were not a little comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we going before to the ship set sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, intending himself to go by land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And sailing from thence, we came the following day over against Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after we came to Miletus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to him the elders of the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you all the time,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Wherefore I testify unto you this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build [you] up, and to give [you] the inheritance among all them that are sanctified.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple, declaring the fulfilment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and straightway the doors were shut.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And forthwith he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, left off beating Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the chief captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand unto the people; and when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Brethren and fathers, hear ye the defence which I now make unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when they heard that he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, they were the more quiet: and he saith,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as ye all are this day:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and I persecuted this Way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and journeyed to Damascus to bring them also that were there unto Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and drew nigh unto Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they that were with me beheld indeed the light, but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me I came into Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">came unto me, and standing by me said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And in that very hour I looked up on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, The God of our fathers hath appointed thee to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For thou shalt be a witness for him unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem; because they will not receive of thee testimony concerning me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the garments of them that slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they gave him audience unto this word; and they lifted up their voice, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as they cried out, and threw off their garments, and cast dust into the air,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">the chief captain commanded him be brought into the castle, bidding that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the centurion heard it, he went to the chief captain and told him, saying, What art thou about to do? for this man is a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the chief captain came and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? And he said, Yea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this citizenship. And Paul said, But I am [a Roman] born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They then that were about to examine him straightway departed from him: and the chief captain also was afraid when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But on the morrow, desiring to know the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Paul, looking stedfastly on the council, said, Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: and sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God`s high priest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Paul said, I knew not, brethren, that he was high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees: touching the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the assembly was divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there arose a great clamor: and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: and what if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they were more than forty that made this conspiracy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore do ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would judge of his case more exactly: and we, before he comes near, are ready to slay him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Paul`s sister`s son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the castle and told Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Paul called unto him one of the centurions, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain; for he hath something to tell him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and saith, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and asked me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the chief captain took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that thou hast to tell me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down Paul tomorrow unto the council, as though thou wouldest inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Do not thou therefore yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink till they have slain him: and now are they ready, looking for the promise from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the chief captain let the young man go, charging him, Tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he called unto him two of the centurions, and said, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and [he bade them] provide beasts, that they might set Paul thereon, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he wrote a letter after this form:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix, greeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be slain of them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And desiring to know the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him down unto their council:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">whom I found to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when it was shown to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to thee forthwith, charging his accusers also to speak against him before thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">and they, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when he had read it, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I will hear thee fully, said he, when thine accusers also are come: and he commanded him to be kept in Herod`s palace.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and [with] an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by the providence evils are corrected for this nation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold: [and we would have judged him according to our law.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">[But the chief captain Lysias came, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,]</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defense:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but [there were] certain Jews from Asia--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">while Paul said in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">If then I am a wrong-doer, and have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if none of those things is [true] whereof these accuse me, no man can give me up unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When therefore they were come together here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I should send him to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Agrippa [said] unto Festus, I also could wish to hear the man myself. To-morrow, saith he, thou shalt hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they were entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye behold this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to write.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it seemeth to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not withal to signify the charges against him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defence:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I think myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before thee this day touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">especially because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">My manner of life then from my youth up, which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">having knowledge of me from the first, if they be willing to testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now I stand [here] to be judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Whereupon as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that journeyed with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but declared both to them of Damascus first and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judaea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For this cause the Jews seized me in the temple, and assayed to kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand unto this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And as he thus made his defense, Festus saith with a loud voice, Paul, thou art mad; thy much learning is turning thee mad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Paul saith, I am not mad, most excellent Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For the king knoweth of these things, unto whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this hath not been done in a corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Agrippa [said] unto Paul, With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Paul [said], I would to God, that whether with little or with much, not thou only, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except these bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and when they had withdrawn, they spake one to another, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail unto the places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the next day we touched at Sidon: and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go unto his friends and refresh himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And putting to sea from thence, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, [a city] of Lycia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not further suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete, over against Salmone;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and with difficulty coasting along it we came unto a certain place called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul admonished them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to put to sea from thence, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter [there; which is] a haven of Crete, looking northeast and south-east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and when the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way [to it,] and were driven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and when they had hoisted it up, they used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And as we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw the [the freight] overboard;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when neither sun nor stars shone upon [us] for many days, and no small tempest lay on [us,] all hope that we should be saved was now taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when they had been long without food, then Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but [only] of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, whom also I serve,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar: and lo, God hath granted thee all them that sail with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But we must be cast upon a certain island.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven to and fro in the [sea of] Adria, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and they sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Wherefore I beseech you to take some food: for this is for your safety: for there shall not a hair perish from the head of any of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he brake it, and began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then were they all of good cheer, and themselves also took food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But lighting upon a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence [of the waves].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the soldiers` counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any [of them] should swim out, and escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stayed them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and the rest, some on planks, and some on [other] things from the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to the land.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the barbarians showed us no common kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with [me]: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded [the matter,] testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">saying, Go thou unto this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For this people`s heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest, haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, called [to be] an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">unto the church of God which is at Corinth, [even] them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called [to be] saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their [Lord] and ours:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I thank my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that in everything ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">who shall also confirm you unto the end, [that ye be] unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God is faithful, through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing and [that] there be no divisions among you; but [that] ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For it hath been signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them [that are of the household] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now this I mean, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos: and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I thank God that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God`s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For behold your calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, [are called]:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose, [yea] and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">that no flesh should glory before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We speak wisdom, however, among them that are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nought:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but we speak God`s wisdom in a mystery, [even] the [wisdom] that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our glory:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">which none of the rulers of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">but as it is written, Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, And [which] entered not into the heart of man, Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But unto us God revealed [them] through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Which things also we speak, not in words which man`s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining spiritual things with spiritual [words].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able [to bear it]: nay, not even now are ye able;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we are God`s fellow-workers: ye are God`s husbandry, God`s building.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">each man`s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man`s work of what sort it is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If any man`s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If any man`s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and ye are Christ`s; and Christ is God`s.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let a man so account of us, as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man`s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his praise from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us ye might learn not [to go] beyond the things which are written; that no one of you be puffed up for the one against the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Already are ye filled, already ye are become rich, ye have come to reign without us: yea and I would that ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For, I think, God hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, both to angels and men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">We are fools for Christ`s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have glory, but we have dishonor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For though ye have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet [have ye] not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begat you through the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of them that are puffed up, but the power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one [of you] hath his father`s wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, [even] Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">not at all [meaning] with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that [your] brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But unto the married I give charge, [yea] not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">(but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such [cases]: but God hath called us in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Was any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use [it] rather.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, [namely,] that it is good for a man to be as he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">and is divided. [So] also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin [daughter], if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart, to keep his own virgin [daughter], shall do well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So then both he that giveth his own virgin [daughter] in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is [anything] in the world, and that there is no God but one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as [of] a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol`s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">My defence to them that examine me is this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Have we no right to eat and to drink?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">or saith he it assuredly for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, [to thresh] in hope of partaking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If others partake of [this] right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat [of] the things of the temple, [and] they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for [it were] good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorifying void.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For though I was free from all [men,] I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And I do all things for the gospel`s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And every man that striveth in the games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they [do it] to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and did all eat the same spiritual food;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we are all partake of the one bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But [I say], that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for this cause ought the woman to have [a sign of] authority on her head, because of the angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord`s supper:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">for in your eating each one taketh before [other] his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord`s death till he come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ye know that when ye were Gentiles [ye were] led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might led.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; to another [divers] kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the body is not one member, but many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And if they were all one member, where were the body?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But now they are many members, but one body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and those [parts] of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">whereas our comely [parts] have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that [part] which lacked;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">that there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or [one] member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, [divers] kinds of tongues.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">by which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and last of all, as to the [child] untimely born, he appeared to me also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Whether then [it be] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yea, we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ`s, at his coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then [cometh] the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I protest by that glorifying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Awake to soberness righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak [this] to move you to shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one [flesh] of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the [glory] of the terrestrial is another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [body].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam [became] a life-giving spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction, through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For as the sufferings of Christ abound unto us, even so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and our hope for you is stedfast; knowing that, as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of the comfort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which befell [us] in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, insomuch that we despaired even of life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">yea, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver: on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For our glorifying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For we write no other things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge, and I hope ye will acknowledge unto the end:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that we are your glorying, even as ye also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And in this confidence I was minded to come first unto you, that ye might have a second benefit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and of you to be set forward on my journey unto Judaea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When I therefore was thus minded, did I show fickleness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yea and nay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, [even] by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him is yea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For how many soever be the promises of God, in him is the yea: wherefore also through him is the Amen, unto the glory of God through us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now he that establisheth us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was [inflicted] by the many;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore I beseech you to confirm [your] love toward him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But to whom ye forgive anything, I [forgive] also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes [have I forgiven it] in the presence of Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables [that are] hearts of flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if the ministration of death, written, [and] engraven on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which [glory] was passing away:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if that which passeth away [was] with glory, much more that which remaineth [is] in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and [are] not as Moses, [who] put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth, it not being revealed [to them] that it is done away in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But unto this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, [there] is liberty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we faint not:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man`s conscience in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in them that perish:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn [upon them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus` sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Seeing it is God, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">[we are] pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, yet not unto despair;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">pursued, yet not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus` sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then death worketh in us, but life in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore did I speak; we also believe, and therefore also we speak;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">knowing that he that raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also with Jesus, and shall present us with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For all things [are] for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound unto the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Wherefore we faint not; but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For our light affliction, which is for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">(for we walk by faith, not by sight);</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things [done] in the body, according to what he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but [speak] as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but [it came to me] through revelation of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews` religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and I advanced in the Jews` religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, [even] from my mother`s womb, and called me through his grace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord`s brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then I came unto the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I went up by revelation; and I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but privately before them who were of repute, lest by any means I should be running, or had run, in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and that because of the false brethren privily brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">to whom we gave place in the way of subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But from those who were reputed to be somewhat (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth not man`s person)-- they, I say, who were of repute imparted nothing to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but contrariwise, when they saw that I had been intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter with [the gospel] of the circumcision</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">(for he that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto the Gentiles);</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">only [they would] that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For before that certain came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Cephas before [them] all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a minister of sin? God forbid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me: and that [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, [the faith] which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">But I say, walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">while it is said, To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, because it was not united by faith with them that heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we who have believed do enter into that rest; even as he hath said, As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest:     although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For he hath said somewhere of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and in this [place] again, They shall not enter into my rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">he again defineth a certain day, To-day, saying in David so long a time afterward (even as hath been said before), To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Having then a great high priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help [us] in time of need.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and by reason thereof is bound, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And no man taketh the honor unto himself, but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Christ also glorified not himself to be made a high priest, but he that spake unto him, Thou art my Son, This day have I begotten thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">as he saith also in another [place,] Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and having been made perfect, he became unto all them that obey him the author of eternal salvation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">named of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Of whom we have many things to say, and hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become dull of hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For when by reason of the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need again that some one teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For every one that partaketh of milk is without experience of the word of righteousness; for he is a babe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But solid food is for fullgrown men, [even] those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Wherefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on unto perfection; not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">of the teaching of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And this will we do, if God permit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and [then] fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receiveth blessing from God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but if it beareth thorns and thistles, it is rejected and nigh unto a curse; whose end is to be burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye showed toward his name, in that ye ministered unto the saints, and still do minister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he sware by himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For men swear by the greater: and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Wherein God, being minded to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">which we have as an anchor of the soul, [a hope] both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">whither as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God), abideth a priest continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priest`s office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of Abraham, and hath blessed him that hath the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And here men that die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what further need [was there] that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given attendance at the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And [what we say] is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for it is witnessed [of him,] Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And inasmuch as [it is] not without the taking of an oath</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him, The Lord sware and will not repent himself, Thou art a priest for ever);</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the [sins] of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, [appointeth] a Son, perfected for evermore.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now in the things which we are saying the chief point [is this]: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this [high priest] also have somewhat to offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">who serve [that which is] a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned [of God] when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and       with the house of Judah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Not according to the covenant that I made with their       fathers In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out       of the land of Egypt; For they continued not in my covenant, And I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For this is the covenant that I will make with the house       of Israel After those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, And on their heart also will I write them: And I will be to them a God, And they shall be to me a people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: For all shall know me, From the least to the greatest of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I will be merciful to their iniquities, And their sins will I remember no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In that he saith, A new [covenant] he hath made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now even a first [covenant] had ordinances of divine service, and its sanctuary, [a sanctuary] of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, wherein [were] the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the Holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein [was] a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron`s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak severally.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the errors of the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">the Holy Spirit this signifying, that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">which [is] a figure for the time present; according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot, as touching the conscience, make the worshipper perfect,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">[being] only (with meats and drinks and divers washings) carnal ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Christ having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled, sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish unto God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For where a testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him that made it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For a testament is of force where there hath been death: for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Wherefore even the first [covenant] hath not been dedicated without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses unto all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded to you-ward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And according to the law, I may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this [cometh] judgment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, apart from sin, to them that wait for him, unto salvation.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For the law having a shadow of the good [things] to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect them that draw nigh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Else would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But in those [sacrifices] there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, But a body didst thou prepare for me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In whole burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou       hadst no pleasure:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then said I, Lo, I am come (In the roll of the book it is       written of me) To do thy will, O God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">then hath he said, Lo, I am come to do thy will. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never take away sins:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the Holy Spirit also beareth witness to us; for after he hath said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws on their heart, And upon their mind also will I write them;     [then saith he,]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no       more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and [having] a great priest over the house of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and having our body washed with pure water,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting [one another]; and so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">A man that hath set at nought Moses law dieth without compassion on [the word of] two or three witnesses:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partakers with them that were so used.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For ye both had compassion on them that were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of you possessions, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Cast not away therefore your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For yet a very little while, He that cometh shall come, and shall not tarry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But my righteous one shall live by faith: And if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now faith is assurance of [things] hoped for, a conviction of things not seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For therein the elders had witness borne to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">By faith we understand that the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out of things which appear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness in respect of his gifts: and through it he being dead yet speaketh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him: for he hath had witness borne to him that before his translation he had been well-pleasing unto God:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">By faith Noah, being warned [of God] concerning things not seen as yet, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Take, brethren, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spake in the name of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Behold, we call them blessed that endured: ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, how that the Lord is full of pity, and merciful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath: but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; that ye fall not under judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Is any among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and the prayer of faith shall save him that is sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, it shall be forgiven him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Confess therefore your sins one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Elijah was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he prayed again; and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My brethren, if any among you err from the truth, and one convert him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">let him know, that he who converteth a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">But ye are a elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for [God`s] own possession, that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lust, which war against the soul;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">having your behavior seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered threatened not; but committed [himself] to him that judgeth righteously:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:</VERS>
