      <VERS vnumber="2">that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and [certain] men of Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they said to me, Those who remain, that are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction and reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is in ruins, and its gates are burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat and wept, and mourned for days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of the heavens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and said, I beseech thee, Jehovah, God of the heavens, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and keep his commandments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, confessing the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We have acted very perversely against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances that thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the peoples;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">but if ye return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was the king's cupbearer.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that] wine was before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now, I had never been sad in his presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the king said to me, Why is thy face sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sadness of heart. And I was very sore afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I said to the king, Let the king live for ever! Why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lies waste, and its gates are consumed with fire?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king said to me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I said to the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king said to me the queen also sitting by him, For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? And it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may set me forward till I come into Judah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which [appertains] to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of a force and horsemen with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobijah the servant, the Ammonite, heard [of it], it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me but I told no man what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem and there was no beast with me, except the beast that I rode upon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I went out by night by the valley-gate, even toward the jackal-fountain, and to the dung-gate; and I viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were in ruins, and its gates were consumed with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And I went on to the fountain-gate, and to the king's pool; and there was no place for the beast under me to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I went up in the night through the valley, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the valley-gate and returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the rulers did not know whither I went or what I did, for I had not as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I said to them, Ye see the distress that we are in, that Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me; as also of the king's words which he had said unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. And they strengthened their hands for the good [work].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobijah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it; and they mocked us and despised us, and said, What is this thing which ye do? will ye rebel against the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I answered them, and said to them, The God of the heavens, he will prosper us, and we his servants will arise and build; but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? shall they be permitted to go on? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, when they are burned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Tobijah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox went up, it would break down their stone wall.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">But we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to the half thereof; for the people had a mind to work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobijah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being repaired, that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and conspired all of them together to come to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and behold, we must bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage [already]; neither is it in the power of our hand [to redeem them], for other men have our fields and our vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I consulted with myself; and I remonstrated with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother! And I set a great assembly against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I said to them, We, according to our ability, have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold to the nations; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? And they were silent and found no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I said, The thing that ye do is not good. Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, so as not to be the reproach of the nations our enemies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I also, my brethren and my servants, we might exact usury of them, money and corn. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Restore, I pray you, to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive-gardens, and their houses, also the hundredth [part] of the money, and of the corn, the wine and the oil, that ye have exacted of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they said, We will restore [them], and will require nothing of them; so will we do, as thou hast said. And I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house and from his earnings, that performeth not this promise: even thus be he shaken out and emptied! And all the congregation said, Amen! And they praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the former governors that were before me had been chargeable to the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver: even their servants bore rule over the people. But I did not so, because of the fear of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yea, also I applied myself to this work of the wall, and we bought no fields; and all my servants were gathered thither for the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and the rulers, besides those that came to us from among the nations that were about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And that which was prepared daily was one ox [and] six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days all sorts of wine in abundance. Yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor; for the service was heavy upon this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Remember for me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobijah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it (though at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down. Why should the work cease, whilst I leave it and come down to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them in the same manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then sent Sanballat his servant to me in this manner the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">in which was written: It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says [it, that] thou and the Jews think to rebel, for which cause thou buildest the wall, and according to these words thou wilt become their king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And thou hast also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning thee at Jerusalem saying, There is a king in Judah! And now it will be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be slackened from the work, that it be not carried out. Now therefore strengthen my hands!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabeel, who had shut himself up. And he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill thee; even in the night are they coming to kill thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, could go into the temple, and live? I will not go in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I perceived, and behold, God had not sent him; for he pronounced this prophecy against me; and Tobijah and Sanballat had hired him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have wherewith to spread an evil report, that they might reproach me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">My God, remember Tobijah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets who would have put me in fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass that when all our enemies heard [of it], all the nations that were about us were afraid and were much cast down in their own eyes, and they perceived that this work was wrought by our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobijah, and those of Tobijah came to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there were many in Judah sworn to him; for he was a son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. [And] Tobijah sent letters to put me in fear.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, that the doorkeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the citadel, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man and feared God above many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I said to them that the gates of Jerusalem should not be opened until the sun was hot, and that they should shut the doors and bar them while they stood by; and that there should be appointed watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one over against his house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (that is, the Ahasuerus that reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the fortress,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">in the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and the princes of the provinces being before him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">when he shewed the glorious wealth of his kingdom and the splendid magnificence of his grandeur many days, a hundred and eighty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when these days were expired, the king made a feast to all the people that were present in Shushan the fortress, both to great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">White, green, and blue [hangings] were fastened with cords of byssus and purple to silver rings and pillars of white marble; couches of gold and silver [lay] upon a pavement of red and white marble, and alabaster, and black marble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they gave drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to the king's bounty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the drinking was, according to commandment, without constraint; for so the king had appointed to all the magnates of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also the queen Vashti made a feast for the women of the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On the seventh day, when the king's heart was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of king Ahasuerus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown to shew the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was of beautiful countenance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the queen Vashti refused to come at the word of the king which was [sent] by the chamberlains; and the king was very wroth, and his fury burned in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the king said to the wise men who knew the times (for so was the king's business [conducted] before all that knew law and judgment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, [and] Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and who sat first in the kingdom),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What shall be done to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not performed the word of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then said Memucan before the king and the princes, The queen Vashti has not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the act of the queen will come abroad to all women, so as to render their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when they shall say, The king Ahasuerus commanded the queen Vashti to be brought in before him, and she came not!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's act, will say it this day to all the king's princes, and there will be contempt and anger enough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If it please the king, let a royal order go forth from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it may not pass, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another that is better than she;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and when the king's edict which he shall make shall be heard throughout his realm for it is great all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, from the greatest to the least.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people according to their language, That every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, when the fury of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then said the king's servants that attended upon him, Let there be maidens, virgins of beautiful countenance, sought for the king;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the young virgins of beautiful countenance to Shushan the fortress, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was in Shushan the fortress a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother and the maiden was fair and beautiful and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the fortress, unto the custody of Hegai, that Esther also was brought into the king's house, unto the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the maiden pleased him, and obtained favour before him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, and her portions, and the seven maidens selected to be given her, out of the king's house; and he removed her and her maids to the best [place] of the house of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Esther had not made known her people nor her birth; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when every maiden's turn came to go in to king Ahasuerus after that she had been treated for twelve months, according to the manner of the women (for so were the days of their purification accomplished six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices, and with things for the purifying of the women,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and thus came the maiden in unto the king), whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, unto the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, keeper of the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained grace in the sight of all them that saw her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus, into his royal house, in the tenth month, that is, the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins, and he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants, Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave presents according to the king's bounty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai sat in the king's gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">(Esther, as Mordecai had charged her, had not yet made known her birth nor her people; for Esther did what Mordecai told her, like as when she was brought up with him.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the thing became known to Mordecai, and he related it to Esther the queen, and Esther told it to the king in Mordecai's name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the matter was investigated and found out; and they were both hanged on a tree. And it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things king Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And all the king's servants that were in the king's gate bowed and did Haman reverence, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did [him] reverence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass as they spoke daily to him, and he hearkened not to them, that they informed Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, Haman was full of fury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he scorned to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai; therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus the people of Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman for each day and for each month, to the twelfth [month], that is, the month Adar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from [those of] every people, and they keep not the king's laws; and it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have charge of the affairs, to bring [it] into the king's treasuries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehovah said unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, my soul [would] not [turn] toward this people. Send [them] out of my sight, and let them go forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith Jehovah: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I will visit them with four kinds [of punishments], saith Jehovah: the sword to slay, and dogs to tear, and the fowl of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I will give them over to be driven hither and thither amongst all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Thou hast cast me off, saith Jehovah, thou art gone backward; and I have stretched out my hand against thee, and will destroy thee: I am become weary of repenting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave of children [and] destroy my people: they have not returned from their ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Their widows are increased to me more than the sand of the seas; I have brought upon them, against the mother of the young men, a spoiler at noonday; I have caused anguish and terror to fall upon her suddenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">She that hath borne seven languisheth, she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it is yet day; she is put to shame and confounded. And the residue of them will I give up to the sword before their enemies, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole land! I have not lent on usury, nor have they lent to me on usury; [yet] every one of them doth curse me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">They shall die of painful deaths; they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground, and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine, and their carcases shall be food for the fowl of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For thus saith Jehovah: Enter not into the house of wailing, neither go to lament or bemoan them; for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith Jehovah, the loving-kindness and the tender mercies.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her precious things; for she hath seen the nations enter into her sanctuary, concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their precious things for food to revive [their] soul. See, Jehovah, and consider, for I am become vile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, whom Jehovah hath afflicted in the day of his fierce anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them; he hath spread a net for my feet; he hath turned me back; he hath made me desolate [and] faint all the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fail; the Lord hath delivered me into hands out of which I am not able to rise up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Lord hath cast down all my mighty men in the midst of me; he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men; the Lord hath trodden as a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water: for the comforter that should revive my soul is far from me; my children are desolate, for the enemy hath prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort her; Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, [that] his adversaries [should be] round about him; Jerusalem is as an impurity among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment. Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow. My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I called for my lovers, they have deceived me; my priests and mine elders have expired in the city, while they sought them food to revive their soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">See, Jehovah, for I am in distress, my bowels are troubled; my heart is turned within me, for I have grievously rebelled: without, the sword hath bereaved [me], within, it is as death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They have heard that I sigh: I have no comforter: all mine enemies have heard of my calamity; they are glad that thou hast done it. Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">How hath the Lord in his anger covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud! He hath cast down from the heavens unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Lord hath swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob, and hath not spared; he hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah: he hath brought [them] down to the ground; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath withdrawn his right hand from before the enemy; and he burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, devouring round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He hath bent his bow like an enemy; he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and hath slain all that was pleasant to the eye: in the tent of the daughter of Zion, he hath poured out his fury like fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The Lord is become as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel; he hath swallowed up all her palaces; he hath destroyed his strongholds, and hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he hath violently cast down his enclosure as a garden; he hath destroyed his place of assembly: Jehovah hath caused set feast and sabbath to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger king and priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath rejected his sanctuary; he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces: they have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as on the day of a set feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out the line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying; and he hath made the rampart and the wall to lament: they languish together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her princes are among the nations: the law is no [more]; her prophets also find no vision from Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, they keep silence; they have cast dust upon their heads, they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their head to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Mine eyes are consumed with tears, my bowels are troubled; my liver is poured upon the earth, because of the ruin of the daughter of my people; because infant and suckling swoon in the streets of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city; when they pour out their soul into their mothers' bosom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">What shall I take to witness for thee? what shall I liken unto thee, daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, virgin daughter of Zion? For thy ruin is great as the sea: who will heal thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Thy prophets have seen vanity and folly for thee; and they have not revealed thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee burdens of falsehood and causes of expulsion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">All that pass by clap [their] hands at thee; they hiss and shake their head at the daughter of Jerusalem: Is this the city which they called, The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">All thine enemies open their mouth against thee, they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed [her] up; this is forsooth the day that we looked for: we have found, we have seen [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jehovah hath done what he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word which he had commanded from the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not spared, and he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Their heart cried unto the Lord. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a torrent day and night: give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Arise, cry out in the night, in the beginning of the watches; pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, who faint from hunger at the top of all the streets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">See, Jehovah, and consider to whom thou hast done this! Shall the women eat their fruit, the infants that they nursed? Shall priest and prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The child and the old man lie on the ground in the streets; my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: thou hast slain [them] in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, thou hast not spared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Thou hast called up, as on the day of a set feast, my terrors on every side; and in the day of Jehovah's anger there was none that escaped or remained: those that I have nursed and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.</VERS>
