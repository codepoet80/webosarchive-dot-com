    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers` [houses].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to [the place] that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah: and Solomon and the assembly sought unto it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before Jehovah, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great lovingkindness unto David my father, and hast made me king in his stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now, O Jehovah God, let thy promise unto David my father be established; for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee; neither shall there any after thee have the like.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, unto Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king`s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they fetched up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Solomon counted out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand men that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein, [even so deal with me].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God. This is [an ordinance] for ever to Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the house which I build is great; for great is our God above all gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But who is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that knoweth how to grave [all manner of] gravings, [to be] with the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and algum-trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loveth his people, he hath made thee king over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Huram said moreover, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And now I have sent a skilful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father`s,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to grave any manner of graving, and to devise any device; that there may be [a place] appointed unto him with thy skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David thy father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Solomon numbered all the sojourners that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people at work.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where [Jehovah] appeared unto David his father, which he made ready in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he began to build in the second [day] of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the porch that was before [the house], the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the greater house he ceiled with fir-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm-trees and chains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he made the most holy house: the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one [cherub] was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was [likewise] five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits [also], joining to the wing of the other cherub.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he made chains in the oracle, and put [them] on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass; and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And under it was the likeness of oxen, which did compass it round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was a handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he set the sea on the right side [of the house] eastward, toward the south.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He made also the bases, and the lavers made he upon the bases;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels thereof, did Huram his father make for king Solomon for the house of Jehovah of bright brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon was the showbread;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and the candlesticks with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple, were of gold.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers` [houses] of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">nd all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast, which was [in] the seventh month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And all the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests the Levites bring up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there it is unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put [there] at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brethren, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah, [saying], For he is good; for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever; that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Jehovah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But I have built thee a house of habitation, and a place for thee to dwell in for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hands fulfilled it, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jehovah hath performed his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And there have I set the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">(for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven, or on earth; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have builded!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou from thy dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest forgive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come [and] swear before thine altar in this house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And if thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the heavens are shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness there be;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling-place and forgive, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of the children of men;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for thy great name`s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thine outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">If thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto a land far off or near;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Now, O my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now therefore arise, O Jehovah God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">O Jehovah God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember [thy] lovingkindnesses to David thy servant.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the priests could not enter into the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovah`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And all the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah was upon the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and gave thanks unto Jehovah, [saying], For he is good; for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of Jehovah, which David the king had made to give thanks unto Jehovah, (for his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever,) when David praised by their ministry: and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away unto their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah, and the king`s house: and all that came into Solomon`s heart to make in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For now have I chosen and hallowed this house, that my name may be there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And this house, which is so high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of Jehovah, and his own house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, that were not of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">of their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, of them did Solomon raise a levy [of bondservants] unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And these were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of Jehovah hath come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Solomon offered burnt-offerings unto Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah, which he had built before the porch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, [even] in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah, and until it was finished. [So] the house of Jehovah was completed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hid from Solomon which he told her not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, his cupbearers also, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: thou exceedest the fame that I heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne, to be king for Jehovah thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, that brought gold from Ophir, brought algum-trees and precious stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the king made of the algum-trees terraces for the house of Jehovah, and for the king`s house, and harps and psalteries for the singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">besides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">nd there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And all king Solomon`s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon,) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spake to Rehoboam, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father`s loins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was brought about of God, that Jehovah might establish his word, which he spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So all Israel departed unto their tents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they hearkened unto the words of Jehovah, and returned from going against Jeroboam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He built Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And in every city [he put] shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. And Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest`s office unto Jehovah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, [and of] Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and she bare him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines, and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, [even] the prince among his brethren; for [he was minded] to make him king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fortified city: and he gave them victuals in abundance. And he sought [for them] many wives.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Jehovah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen. And the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came unto Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Ye have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Jehovah is righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king`s house: he took all away: he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the door of the king`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it was so, that, as oft as the king entered into the house of Jehovah, the guard came and bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he humbled himself, the wrath of Jehovah turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and moreover in Judah there were good things [found].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother`s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of [other] lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of [them that are] no gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and [we have] priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also [set they] in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king`s son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because Jehovah, the God of your fathers, was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage which hath reached up to heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: [but] are there not even with you trespasses of your own against Jehovah your God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for ye purpose that which will bring upon us a trespass against Jehovah, to add unto our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the men that have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, unto their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns thereof, and Timnah with the towns thereof, Gimzo also and the towns thereof: and they dwelt there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For Jehovah brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed sore against Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but it helped him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Jehovah, this same king Ahaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, [therefore] will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of his fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="29">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And the number of the burnt-offerings which the assembly brought was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves unto Jehovah, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever, and serve Jehovah your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if ye turn again unto Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth [day] of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings into the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood [which they received] of the hand of the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For there were many in the assembly that had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Jehovah pardon every one</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">that setteth his heart to seek God, Jehovah, the God of his fathers, though [he be] not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, [singing] with loud instruments unto Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that had good understanding [in the service] of Jehovah. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept [other] seven days with gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even unto heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and brake down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">[He appointed] also the king`s portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings, [to wit], for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised augury, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he set the graven image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances [given] by Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jehovah spake to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Wherefore Jehovah brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he was in distress, he besought Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he prayed unto him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah he was God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he compassed Ophel about [with it], and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he built up the altar of Jehovah, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only unto Jehovah their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">His prayer also, and how [God] was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he humbled not himself before Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="34">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they brake down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the sun-images that were on high above them he hewed down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it upon the graves [of them] that had sacrificed unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And [so did he] in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, in their ruins round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he brake down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and the workmen that wrought in the house of Jehovah gave it to mend and repair the house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and [others of] the Levites, all that were skilful with instruments of music.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all that did the work in every manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah [given] by Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they are doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read therein before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king`s servant, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to do according unto all that is written in this book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Hilkiah, and they whom the king [had commanded], went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spake to her to that effect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled thyself before me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought back word to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand [to it]. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Jehovah their God. All his days they departed not from following Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="35">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Josiah kept a passover unto Jehovah in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth [day] of the first month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, that were holy unto Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders: now serve Jehovah your God, and his people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And prepare yourselves after your fathers` houses by your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers` houses of your brethren the children of the people, and [let there be for each] a portion of a fathers` house of the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of Jehovah by Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the passover-offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king`s substance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And his princes gave for a freewill-offering unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred [small cattle], and three hundred oxen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover-offerings five thousand [small cattle], and five hundred oxen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the king`s commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled [the blood which they received] of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers` houses of the children of the people, to offer unto Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron [were busied] in offering the burnt-offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king`s seer; and the porters were at every gate: they needed not to depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? [I come] not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war; and God hath commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from [meddling with] God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations unto this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="36">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father`s stead in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Joahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God; he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet [speaking] from the mouth of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of Jehovah which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jehovah, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Jehovah arose against his people, till there was no remedy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or virgin, old man or hoary-headed: he gave them all into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths: [for] as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and [put it] also in writing, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

      <VERS vnumber="1">But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have provoked [thee] to anger before the builders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto half [the height] thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times from all places, Ye must return unto us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set [there] the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They all builded the wall and they that bare burdens laded themselves; every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">in what place soever ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us; our God will fight for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one [went with] his weapon [to] the water.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king`s tribute [upon] our fields and our vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage [already]: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold unto the nations; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [one of] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, [O God], strengthen thou my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty and two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard [thereof], that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. [And] Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand [on guard], let them shut the doors, and bar ye them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one [to be] over against his house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">But in all this [time] I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute unto their brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses [therewith]; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified [against them] in the day wherein they sold victuals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews` language, but according to the language of each people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and fourscore days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king`s palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">[There were hangings of] white [cloth], [of] green, and [of] blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and white, and yellow, and black marble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the drinking was according to the law; none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man`s pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king`s commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king`s manner toward all that knew law and judgment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and the next unto him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king`s face, and sat first in the kingdom),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen say [the like] unto all the king`s princes. So [will there arise] much contempt and wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the king`s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">for he sent letters into all the king`s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then said the king`s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king`s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle`s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So it came to pass, when the king`s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king`s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the king`s house: and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women`s house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, [to wit], six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">then in this wise came the maiden unto the king: whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king`s chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king`s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther`s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king`s gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king`s gate, two of the king`s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king [thereof] in Mordecai`s name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And all the king`s servants, that were in the king`s gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the king`s servants, that were in the king`s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king`s commandment?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai`s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, [to] the twelfth [month], which is the month Adar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from [those of] every people; neither keep they the king`s laws: therefore it is not for the king`s profit to suffer them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the [king`s] business, to bring it into the king`s treasuries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews` enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then were the king`s scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof; and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king`s satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king`s ring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And letters were sent by posts into all the king`s provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The posts went forth in haste by the king`s commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and he came even before the king`s gate: for none might enter within the king`s gate clothed with sackcloth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in every province, whithersoever the king`s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Esther`s maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he received it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king`s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king`s gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king`s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Esther spake unto Hathach, and gave him a message unto Mordecai [saying]:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All the king`s servants, and the people of the king`s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they told to Mordecai Esther`s words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Mordecai bade them return answer unto Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king`s house, more than all the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father`s house will perish: and who knoweth whether thou art not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king`s house, over against the king`s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Esther said, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king`s gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by her together with the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king`s gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king`s chamberlains, of those that kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then said the king`s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king`s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king`s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Haman said unto the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on the head of which a crown royal is set:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king`s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor.</VERS>

Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">While they were yet talking with him, came the king`s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="18" bname="Job" bsname="Job">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and turned away from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother`s house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and the Sabeans fell [upon them], and took them away: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother`s house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and he said, Naked came I out of my mother`s womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jehovah said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when Job`s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Let that day be darkness; Let not God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine upon it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what [can] the man [do] that cometh after the king? [even] that which hath been done long ago.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For all his days are [but] sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">There is nothing better for a man [than] that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For to the man that pleaseth him [God] giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Wherefore have we fasted, [say they], and thou seest not? [wherefore] have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find [your own] pleasure, and exact all your labors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Jehovah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of Jehovah shall by thy rearward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in dry places, and make strong thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, [and] the holy of Jehovah honorable; and shalt honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking [thine own] words:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah; and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth; and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Behold, Jehovah`s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, so that he will not hear.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">None sueth in righteousness, and none pleadeth in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They hatch adders` eggs, and weave the spider`s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth; and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">The way of peace they know not; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">We grope for the wall like the blind; yea, we grope as they that have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among them that are lusty we are as dead men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We roar all like bears, and moan sore like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">transgressing and denying Jehovah, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yea, truth is lacking; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Jehovah driveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And a Redeemer will come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed`s seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; I have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, I know not how to speak; for I am a child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Jehovah said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for to whomsoever I shall send thee thou shalt go, and whatsoever I shall command thee thou shalt speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Be not afraid because of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said Jehovah unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I watch over my word to perform it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a boiling caldron; and the face thereof is from the north.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Jehovah said unto me, Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith Jehovah; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">thus saith Jehovah, What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Neither said they, Where is Jehovah that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed through, and where no man dwelt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The priests said not, Where is Jehovah? and they that handle the law knew me not: the rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore I will yet contend with you, saith Jehovah, and with your children`s children will I contend.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For pass over to the isles of Kittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there hath been such a thing.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">who say to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">How trimmest thou thy way to seek love! therefore even the wicked women hast thou taught thy ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: thou didst not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man`s, will he return unto her again? will not that land be greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Lift up thine eyes unto the bare heights, and see; where hast thou not been lain with? By the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; yet thou hast a harlot`s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And I said after she had done all these things, She will return unto me; but she returned not: and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jehovah said unto me, Backsliding Israel hath showed herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith Jehovah; I will not look in anger upon you; for I am merciful, saith Jehovah, I will not keep [anger] for ever.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Flee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looketh forth from the north, and a great destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As a well casteth forth its waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Thus saith Jehovah, Stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk [therein].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I set watchmen over you, [saying], Hearken to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not hearken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">To what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a people cometh from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">We have heard the report thereof; our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, [and] terror, are on every side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I have made thee a trier [and] a fortress among my people; that thou mayest know and try their way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Refuse silver shall men them, because Jehovah hath rejected them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Stand in the gate of Jehovah`s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, are these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">if ye oppress not the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your own hurt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even for evermore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods that ye have not known,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered; that ye may do all these abominations?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And now, because ye have done all these works, saith Jehovah, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">therefore will I do unto the house which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Do they provoke me to anger? saith Jehovah; [do they] not [provoke] themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, mine anger and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt-offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat ye flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but this thing I commanded them, saying, Hearken unto my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and walk ye in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in [their own] counsels [and] in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day, I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff: they did worse than their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And thou shalt say unto them, This is the nation that hath not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, nor received instruction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Cut off thy hair, [O Jerusalem], and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for Jehovah hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight, saith Jehovah: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into my mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter: for they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place [to bury].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land shall become a waste.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time, saith Jehovah, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and which they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried, they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith Jehovah of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: Shall men fall, and not rise up again? Shall one turn away, and not return?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turneth to his course, as a horse that rusheth headlong in the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yea, the stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle-dove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the law of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of Jehovah is with us? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes hath wrought falsely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The wise men are put to shame, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of Jehovah; and what manner of wisdom is in them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall possess them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness; from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I will utterly consume them, saith Jehovah: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf shall fade; and [the things that] I have given them shall pass away from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there; for Jehovah our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We looked for peace, but no good came; [and] for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan: at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembleth; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it; the city and those that dwell therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For, behold, I will send serpents, adders, among you, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow! my heart is faint within me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off: is not Jehovah in Zion? is not her King in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with foreign vanities?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt: I mourn; dismay hath taken hold on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they bend their tongue, [as it were] their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Take ye heed every one of his neighbor, and trust ye not in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with slanders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how [else] should I do, because of the daughter of my people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he layeth wait for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Shall I not visit them for these things? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passeth through; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the birds of the heavens and the beasts are fled, they are gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and [who is] he to whom the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken, that he may declare it? wherefore is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that none passeth through?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Jehovah saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baalim, which their fathers taught them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the skilful women, that they may come:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we ruined! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbor lamentation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from without, [and] the young men from the streets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Speak, Thus saith Jehovah, The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman; and none shall gather [them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Thus saith Jehovah, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he hath understanding, and knoweth me, that I am Jehovah who exerciseth lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will punish all them that are circumcised in [their] uncircumcision:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners [of their hair] cut off, that dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hear ye the word which Jehovah speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">thus saith Jehovah, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They are like a palm-tree, of turned work, and speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There is none like unto thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">when he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is [my] grief, and I must bear it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Jehovah: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure: not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that I may establish the oath which I sware unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then answered I, and said, Amen, O Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jehovah said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jehovah said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry unto me, but I will not hearken unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me because of their trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What hath my beloved to do in my house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness [with] many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For thus saith Jehovah: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and I brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons, for ever:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land wherein ye sojourn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we dwell at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and unto this day they drink none, for they obey their father`s commandment: but I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; and ye have not hearkened unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Forasmuch as the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people hath not hearkened unto me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he commanded you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="36">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of Jehovah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in Jehovah`s house upon the fast-day; and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It may be they will present their supplication before Jehovah, and will return every one from his evil way; for great is the anger and the wrath that Jehovah hath pronounced against this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of Jehovah in Jehovah`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Jehovah`s house, in the ears of all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of Jehovah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">he went down into the king`s house, into the scribe`s chamber: and, lo, all the princes were sitting there, [to wit], Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month: and [there was a fire in] the brazier burning before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that [the king] cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll; but he would not hear them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king`s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah hid them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they hearkened not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides unto them many like words.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="37">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of Jehovah, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto Jehovah our God for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Pharaoh`s army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans that were besieging Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they brake up from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then came the word of Jehovah unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to inquire of me: Behold, Pharaoh`s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Thus saith Jehovah, Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yea would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh`s army,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou art falling away to the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon-house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from Jehovah? And Jeremiah said, There is. He said also, Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And now hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be presented before thee, that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard; and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers` street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="38">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spake unto all the people, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus saith Jehovah, He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey, and he shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Thus saith Jehovah, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the princes said unto the king, Let this man, we pray thee, be put to death; forasmuch as he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do anything against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king`s son, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king`s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Ebed-melech went forth out of the king`s house, and spake to the king, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of Jehovah: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt go forth unto the king of Babylon`s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon`s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of Jehovah, in that which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that Jehovah hath showed me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah`s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon`s princes, and those women shall say, Thy familiar friends have set thee on, and have prevailed over thee: [now that] thy feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan`s house, to die there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="39">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">that all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, [to wit], Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king`s garden, through the gate betwixt the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Moreover he put out Zedekiah`s eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the Chaldeans burned the king`s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people that remained in the city, the deserters also that fell away to him, and the residue of the people that remained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, that had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Go, and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But I will deliver thee in that day, saith Jehovah; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I will surely save thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="40">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, that were carried away captive unto Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, Jehovah thy God pronounced this evil upon this place;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and Jehovah hath brought it, and done according as he spake: because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which are upon thy hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well unto thee; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee; whither it seemeth good and right unto thee to go, thither go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now while he was not yet gone back, Go back then, [said he], to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wheresoever it seemeth right unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a present, and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now when all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, [to wit], Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans that shall come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">then all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and said unto him, Dost thou know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take thy life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he take thy life, that all the Jews that are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="41">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal and [one of] the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, [to wit], with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, the men of war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with meal-offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, [and cast them] into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel,) Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king`s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now it came to pass that, when all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, [to wit], the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and they departed, and dwelt in Geruth Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="42">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we pray thee, our supplication be presented before thee, and pray for us unto Jehovah thy God, even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">that Jehovah thy God may show us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing that we should do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto Jehovah your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing Jehovah shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then they said to Jeremiah, Jehovah be a true and faithful witness amongst us, if we do not according to all the word wherewith Jehovah thy God shall send thee to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Jehovah our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith Jehovah: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land; so that ye obey not the voice of Jehovah your God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">now therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, If ye indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there: they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: As mine anger and my wrath hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt; and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jehovah hath spoken concerning you, O remnant of Judah, Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have testified unto you this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For ye have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for ye sent me unto Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us unto Jehovah our God; and according unto all that Jehovah our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God in anything for which he hath sent me unto you.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="43">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass that, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of Jehovah their God, wherewith Jehovah their God had sent him to them, even all these words,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: Jehovah our God hath not sent thee to say, Ye shall not go into Egypt to sojourn there;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of Jehovah, to dwell in the land of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all the nations whither they had been driven, to sojourn in the land of Judah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">the men, and the women, and the children, and the king`s daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and they came into the land of Egypt; for they obeyed not the voice of Jehovah: and they came unto Tahpanhes.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">and say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he shall come, and shall smite the land of Egypt; such as are for death [shall be given] to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He shall also break the pillars of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, that dwelt at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, [and] to serve other gods, that they knew not, neither they, nor ye, nor your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherefore my wrath and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore now thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Wherefore commit ye [this] great evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">in that ye provoke me unto anger with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to sojourn; that ye may be cut off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be an execration, [and] an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">so that none of the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or be left, to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return save such as shall escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of Jehovah, we will not hearken unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven, and pouring out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink-offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink-offerings unto her, without our husbands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people that had given him that answer, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not Jehovah remember them, and came it not into his mind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">so that Jehovah could not longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as it is this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of Jehovah, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her: establish then your vows, and perform your vows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith Jehovah, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord Jehovah liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And this shall be the sign unto you, saith Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy, and sought his life.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For through the anger of Jehovah did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and       because of great servitude; She dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest: All her persecutors overtook her within the straits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn       assembly; All her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh: Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper; For Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her       transgressions: Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed: Her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, And they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of       her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the       days of old: When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none       did help her, The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is become       as an unclean thing; All that honored her despise her, because they have seen her       nakedness: Yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered not her       latter end; Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she hath no comforter: Behold, O Jehovah, my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified       himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her       pleasant things: For she hath seen that the nations are entered into her       sanctuary, Concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter       into thine assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All her people sigh, they seek bread; They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the       soul: See, O Jehovah, and behold; for I am become abject.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow,       which is brought upon me, Wherewith Jehovah hath afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce       anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it       prevaileth against them; He hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: He hath made me desolate and faint all the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand; They are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath       made my strength to fail: The Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am       not able to stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the       midst of me; He hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young       men: The Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of       Judah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a       cloud in his anger! He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of       Israel, And hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob,       and hath not pitied: He hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter       of Judah; He hath brought them down to the ground; he hath profaned the       kingdom and the princes thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel; He hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy: And he hath burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth       round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He hath bent his bow like an enemy, he hath stood with his       right hand as an adversary, And hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye: In the tent of the daughter of Zion he hath poured out his wrath       like fire.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it       were of a garden; he hath destroyed his place of assembly: Jehovah hath caused solemn assembly and sabbath to be forgotten       in Zion, And hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and       the priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his       sanctuary; He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her       palaces: They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as in the day of       a solemn assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter       of Zion; He hath stretched out the line, he hath not withdrawn his hand       from destroying; And he hath made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish       together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and       broken her bars: Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is       not; Yea, her prophets find no vision from Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground,       they keep silence; They have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded       themselves with sackcloth: The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Mine eyes do fail with tears, my heart is troubled; My liver is poured upon the earth, because of the destruction of       the daughter of my people, Because the young children and the sucklings swoon in the       streets of the city.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Thy prophets have seen for thee false and foolish visions; And they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring back thy       captivity, But have seen for thee false oracles and causes of banishment.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against       thee; They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her       up; Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we       have seen it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jehovah hath done that which he purposed; he hath       fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old; He hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: And he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath       exalted the horn of thine adversaries.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">See, O Jehovah, and behold to whom thou hast done thus! Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled       in the hands? Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of       the Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the       streets; My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: Thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast       slaughtered, [and] not pitied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Thou hast called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my       terrors on every side; And there was none that escaped or remained in the day of       Jehovah`s anger: Those that I have dandled and brought up hath mine enemy       consumed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In the fifth [day] of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin`s captivity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst thereof as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf`s foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings [thus]:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And their faces and their wings were separate above; two [wings] of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: [the fire] went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto a beryl: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not when they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the terrible crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And [I heard] the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and they played the harlot in Egypt; they played the harlot in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bare sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians [her] neighbors,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomsoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Neither hath she left her whoredoms since [the days of] Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity; and they poured out their whoredom upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and her they slew with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgments upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her whoredoms which were more than the whoredoms of her sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and rulers, [her] neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And she increased her whoredoms; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">girded with girdles upon their loins, with flowing turbans upon their heads, all of them princes to look upon, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So she uncovered her whoredoms, and uncovered her nakedness: then my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was alienated from her sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, remembering the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in the handling of thy bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of thy youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore, O Oholibah, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, [and] all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown, all of them riding upon horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they shall come against thee with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples; they shall set themselves against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about; and I will commit the judgment unto them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury; they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy residue shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom [brought] from the land of Egypt; so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare; and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">These things shall be done unto thee, for that thou hast played the harlot after the nations, and because thou art polluted with their idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou shalt drink of thy sister`s cup, which is deep and large; thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Thou shalt even drink it and drain it out, and thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof, and shalt tear thy breasts; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jehovah said moreover unto me: Son of man, wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? then declare unto them their abominations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols have they committed adultery; and they have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass through [the fire] unto them to be devoured.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And furthermore ye have sent for men that come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent, and, lo, they came; for whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thine eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">and sit upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou didst set mine incense and mine oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets upon the hands of them [twain], and beautiful crowns upon their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then said I of her that was old in adulteries, Now will they play the harlot with her, and she [with them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And they went in unto her, as they go in unto a harlot: so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah, the lewd women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And the company shall stone them with stones, and despatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Son of man, write thee the name of the day, [even] of this selfsame day: the king of Babylon drew close unto Jerusalem this selfsame day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Set on the caldron, set it on, and also pour water into it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile [of wood] for the bones under [the caldron]; make it boil well; yea, let the bones thereof be boiled in the midst of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust is not gone out of it! take out of it piece after piece; No lot is fallen upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She hath wearied [herself] with toil; yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her; her rust [goeth not forth] by fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have cleansed thee and thou wast not cleansed, thou shalt not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my wrath toward thee to rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I, Jehovah, have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Also the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet thou shalt neither mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind thy headtire upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in [certain] of the children of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the nobles;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">youths in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and endued with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king`s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king`s dainties, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they should stand before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the prince of the eunuchs gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave [the name of] Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, [of] Shadrach; and to Mishael, [of] Meshach; and to Azariah, [of] Abed-nego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king`s dainties, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king`s dainties; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the king`s dainties.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So the steward took away their dainties, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And in every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if ye show the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would gain time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king`s matter, forasmuch as no king, lord, or ruler, hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king`s guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">he answered and said to Arioch the king`s captain, Wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should nor perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom and might are his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">he revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of thee; for thou hast made known unto us the king`s matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show unto the king;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Thou, O king, sawest, and, behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the aspect thereof was terrible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Thou, O king, art king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all: thou art the head of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters` clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nebuchadnezzar answered and said unto them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, [well]: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If it be [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: [therefore] he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, [and] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore because the king`s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spake and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king`s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king`s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It hath seemed good unto me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, [saying],</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and the height thereof was great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">let his heart be changed from man`s, and let a beast`s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the lowest of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken dumb for a while, and his thoughts troubled him.

      <VERS vnumber="20">The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The king spake and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">While the word was in the king`s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, [saying], O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">and thou shalt be driven from men; and they dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles` [feathers], and his nails like birds` [claws].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink therefrom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In the same hour came forth the fingers of a man`s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king`s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the king`s countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spake and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then came in all the king`s wise men; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">[Now] the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: the queen spake and said, O king, live forever; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, [I say], thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, who art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and dissolve doubts; now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts`, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the Most High God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and that he setteth up over it whomsoever he will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine from them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">TEKEL; thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">PERES; thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the king should have no damage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault, forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counsellors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem) and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king`s interdict: Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save unto thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then these men assembled together unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. [Now] the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions` mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the king commanded, and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be even unto the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The first was like a lion, and had eagle`s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man`s heart was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, [and] the wheels thereof burning fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other [horn] which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable [horns] toward the four winds of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious [land].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual [burnt-offering], and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the host was given over [to it] together with the continual [burnt-offering] through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did [its pleasure] and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision [concerning] the continual [burnt-offering], and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I heard a man`s voice between [the banks of] the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do [his pleasure]; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in [their] security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days [to come].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king`s business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishing of the desolations of Jerusalem, even seventy years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I prayed unto Jehovah my God, and made confession, and said, Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from thy precepts and from thine ordinances;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, that spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness; for we have rebelled against him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">neither have we obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside, that they should not obey thy voice: therefore hath the curse been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet have we not entreated the favor of Jehovah our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in thy truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore hath Jehovah watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth, and we have not obeyed his voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, let thine anger and thy wrath, I pray thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are round about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now therefore, O our God, hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord`s sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness, but for thy great mercies` sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God, because thy city and thy people are called by thy name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he instructed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee wisdom and understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment went forth, and I am come to tell thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the anointed one, the prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: it shall be built again, with street and moat, even in troublous times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And after the threescore and two weeks shall the anointed one be cut off, and shall have nothing: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and even unto the end shall be war; desolations are determined.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease; and upon the wing of abominations [shall come] one that maketh desolate; and even unto the full end, and that determined, shall [wrath] be poured out upon the desolate.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like unto burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said unto me, O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard: and I am come for thy words` sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for [many] days:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and when he had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I retain no strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spake unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me against these, but Michael your prince.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and when he is waxed strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king of the south shall be strong, and [one] of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And at the end of years they shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm; but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in those times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place, who shall come unto the army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And also their gods, with their molten images, [and] with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, shall he carry captive into Egypt; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And his sons shall war, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on, and overflow, and pass through; and they shall return and war, even to his fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north; and he shall set forth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the multitude shall be lifted up, and his heart shall be exalted; and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former; and he shall come on at the end of the times, [even of] years, with a great army and with much substance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the children of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they shall fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city: and the forces of the south shall not stand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the glorious land, and in his hand shall be destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions; and he shall perform them: and he shall give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she shall not stand, neither be for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; yea, moreover, he shall cause his reproach to turn upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then shall stand up in his place one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And in his place shall stand up a contemptible person, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully; for he shall come up, and shall become strong, with a small people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">In time of security shall he come even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers` fathers; he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance: yea, he shall devise his devices against the strongholds, even for a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army; but he shall not stand; for they shall devise devices against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Yea, they that eat of his dainties shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow; and many shall fall down slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table: but it shall not prosper; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then shall he return into his land with great substance; and his heart [shall be] against the holy covenant; and he shall do [his pleasure], and return to his own land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For ships of Kittim shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved, and shall return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and shall do [his pleasure]: he shall even return, and have regard unto them that forsake the holy covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And forces shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and shall take away the continual [burnt-offering], and they shall set up the abomination that maketh desolate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries; but the people that know their God shall be strong, and do [exploits].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they that are wise among the people shall instruct many; yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, [many] days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help; but many shall join themselves unto them with flatteries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And some of them that are wise shall fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods; and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall magnify himself above all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god: whosoever acknowledgeth [him] he will increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for a price.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And at the time of the end shall the king of the south contend with him; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass through.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many [countries] shall be overthrown; but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries; and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then I, Daniel, looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on the brink of the river on this side, and the other on the brink of the river on that side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my lord, what shall be the issue of these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Jehovah that came unto Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When Jehovah spake at the first by Hosea, Jehovah said unto Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom; for the land doth commit great whoredom, [departing] from Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bare him a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jehovah said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And [Jehovah] said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by Jehovah their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And [Jehovah] said, Call his name Lo-ammi; for ye are not my people, and I will not be your [God].</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Yea, upon her children will I have no mercy; for they are children of whoredom;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then was Jehovah jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Jehovah answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but I will remove far off from you the northern [army], and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench shall come up, and its ill savor shall come up, because it hath done great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Jehovah hath done great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God; for he giveth you the former rain in just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first [month].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is none else; and my people shall never be put to shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as Jehovah hath said, and among the remnant those whom Jehovah doth call.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will execute judgment upon them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations: and they have parted my land,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yea, and what are ye to me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? will ye render me a recompense? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompense upon your own head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Forasmuch as ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly precious things,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem unto the sons of the Grecians, that ye may remove them far from their border;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">behold, I will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompense upon your own head;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off: for Jehovah hath spoken it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war; stir up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Haste ye, and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Let the nations bestir themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Put ye in the sickle; for the harvest is ripe: come, tread ye; for the winepress is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! for the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but Jehovah will be a refuge unto his people, and a stronghold to the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So shall ye know that I am Jehovah your God, dwelling in Zion my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and shall water the valley of Shittim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Judah shall abide for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And I will cleanse their blood, that I have not cleansed: for Jehovah dwelleth in Zion.</VERS>
