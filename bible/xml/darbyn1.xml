    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God said, Let there be light. And there was light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided between the light and the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening, and there was morning the first day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it be a division between waters and waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And God made the expanse, and divided between the waters that are under the expanse and the waters that are above the expanse; and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God called the expanse Heavens. And there was evening, and there was morning a second day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry [land] appear. And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And God called the dry [land] Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God said, Let the earth cause grass to spring up, herb producing seed, fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind, the seed of which is in them, on the earth. And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the earth brought forth grass, herb producing seed after its kind, and trees yielding fruit, the seed of which is in them, after their kind. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there was evening, and there was morning a third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens, to divide between the day and the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens, to give light on the earth. And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And God made the two great lights, the great light to rule the day, and the small light to rule the night, and the stars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And God set them in the expanse of the heavens, to give light on the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and to rule during the day and during the night, and to divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And there was evening, and there was morning a fourth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living souls, and let fowl fly above the earth in the expanse of the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And God created the great sea monsters, and every living soul that moves with which the waters swarm, after their kind, and every winged fowl after its kind. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there was evening, and there was morning a fifth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And God said, Let the earth bring forth living souls after their kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth, after their kind. And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing of the ground after its kind. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over every animal that moveth on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb producing seed that is on the whole earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree producing seed: it shall be food for you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and to every animal of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth on the earth, in which is a living soul, every green herb for food. And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning the sixth day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the heavens and the earth and all their host were finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And God had finished on the seventh day his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because that on it he rested from all his work which God had created in making it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These are the histories of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in the day that Jehovah Elohim made earth and heavens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and every shrub of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for Jehovah Elohim had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But a mist went up from the earth, and moistened the whole surface of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jehovah Elohim formed Man, dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jehovah Elohim planted a garden in Eden eastward, and there put Man whom he had formed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; and the tree of life, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a river went out of Eden, to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four main streams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of the one is Pison: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Havilah, where the gold is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and the onyx stone are there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the name of the second river is Gihon: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Cush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which flows forward toward Asshur. And the fourth river, that is Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jehovah Elohim took Man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it and to guard it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jehovah Elohim commanded Man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou shalt freely eat;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt certainly die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jehovah Elohim said, It is not good that Man should be alone; I will make him a helpmate, his like.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim had formed every animal of the field and all fowl of the heavens, and brought [them] to Man, to see what he would call them; and whatever Man called each living soul, that was its name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, he found no helpmate, his like.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jehovah Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Man; and he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up flesh in its stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Jehovah Elohim built the rib that he had taken from Man into a woman; and brought her to Man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Man said, This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they were both naked, Man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the serpent was more crafty than any animal of the field which Jehovah Elohim had made. And it said to the woman, Is it even so, that God has said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, and ye shall not touch it, lest ye die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the serpent said to the woman, Ye will not certainly die;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but God knows that in the day ye eat of it, your eyes will be opened, and ye will be as God, knowing good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a pleasure for the eyes, and the tree was to be desired to give intelligence; and she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they heard the voice of Jehovah Elohim, walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah Elohim, in the midst of the trees of the garden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jehovah Elohim called to Man, and said to him, Where art thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I feared, because I am naked; and I hid myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said, Who told thee that thou art naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee not to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Man said, The woman, whom thou hast given [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Jehovah Elohim said to the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jehovah Elohim said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, be thou cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. On thy belly shalt thou go, and eat dust all the days of thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall crush thy head, and thou shalt crush his heel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To the woman he said, I will greatly increase thy travail and thy pregnancy; with pain thou shalt bear children; and to thy husband shall be thy desire, and he shall rule over thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed be the ground on thy account; with toil shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of thy life;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and thorns and thistles shall it yield thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, until thou return to the ground: for out of it wast thou taken. For dust thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Man called his wife's name Eve; because she is the mother of all living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jehovah Elohim made Adam and his wife coats of skin, and clothed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Jehovah Elohim said, Behold, Man is become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he stretch out his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever !</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore Jehovah Elohim sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he drove out Man; and he set the Cherubim, and the flame of the flashing sword, toward the east of the garden of Eden, to guard the way to the tree of life.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have acquired a man with Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And she further bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, but Cain was a husbandman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat. And Jehovah looked upon Abel, and on his offering;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and upon Cain, and on his offering, he did not look. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jehovah said to Cain, Why art thou angry, and why is thy countenance fallen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If thou doest well, will not [thy countenance] look up [with confidence]? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and unto thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Cain spoke to Abel his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now be thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield thee its strength; a wanderer and fugitive shalt thou be on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is too great to be borne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the ground, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a wanderer and fugitive on the earth; and it will come to pass, [that] every one who finds me will slay me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jehovah said to him, Therefore, whoever slayeth Cain, it shall be revenged sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, toward the east of Eden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city; and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael; and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lemech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Lemech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the second, Zillah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and [breed] cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of those who handle the harp and pipe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, the forger of every kind of tool of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Lemech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice, Ye wives of Lemech, listen to my speech. For I have slain a man for my wound, and a youth for my bruise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold; Lemech seventy and seven fold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain has slain him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And to Seth, to him also was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Speak unto all the assembly of Israel, saying, On the tenth of this month let them take themselves each a lamb, for a father's house, a lamb for a house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And if the household be too small for a lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take [it] according to the number of the souls; each according to [the measure] of his eating shall ye count for the lamb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Your lamb shall be without blemish, a yearling male; ye shall take [it] from the sheep, or from the goats.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel shall kill it between the two evenings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they shall take of the blood, and put [it] on the two door-posts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter [herbs] shall they eat it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Ye shall eat none of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with its in-wards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And ye shall let none of it remain until the morning; and what remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And thus shall ye eat it: your loins shall be girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste; it is Jehovah's passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the blood shall be for you as a sign on the houses in which ye are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be among you for destruction, when I smite the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall celebrate it [as] a feast to Jehovah; throughout your generations [as] an ordinance for ever shall ye celebrate it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread: on the very first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses; for whoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And on the first day ye shall have a holy convocation, and on the seventh day a holy convocation: no manner of work shall be done on them, save what is eaten by every person that only shall be done by you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And ye shall keep the [feast of] unleavened [bread]; for in this same day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; and ye shall keep this day in your generations [as] an ordinance for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month in the evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses; for whoever eateth what is leavened that soul shall be cut off from the assembly of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or born in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Ye shall eat nothing leavened: in all your dwellings shall ye eat unleavened bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Moses called all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Seize and take yourselves lambs for your families, and kill the passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And take a bunch of hyssop, and dip [it] in the blood that is in the bason, and smear the lintel and the two door-posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two door-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come into your houses to smite [you].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And ye shall observe this as an ordinance for thee and for thy sons for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And it shall come to pass, when ye are come into the land that Jehovah will give you, as he has promised, that ye shall keep this service.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to you, What mean ye by this service?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">that ye shall say, It is a sacrifice of passover to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when he smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses. And the people bowed their heads and worshipped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the children of Israel went away, and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron; so did they.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it came to pass that at midnight Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his bondmen, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house in which there was not one dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he called Moses and Aaron in the night, and said, Rise up, go away from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and go; and bless me also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the Egyptians urged the people, to send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead [men]!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the people took their dough before it was leavened; their kneading-troughs bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, and they had asked of the Egyptians utensils of silver, and utensils of gold, and clothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Jehovah had given the people favour in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they gave to them; and they spoiled the Egyptians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot [that were] men, besides children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks and herds very much cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they baked the dough that they brought forth out of Egypt into unleavened cakes, for it was not leavened; for they were driven out of Egypt, and could not wait; neither had they prepared for themselves any food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And the residence of the children of Israel that they resided in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, on that same day it came to pass that all the hosts of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">It is a night of observance to Jehovah, because of their being brought out from the land of Egypt: that same night is an observance to Jehovah for all the children of Israel in their generations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: No stranger shall eat of it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">but every man's bondman that is bought for money let him be circumcised: then shall he eat it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">A settler and a hired servant shall not eat it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth any of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">All the assembly of Israel shall hold it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And when a sojourner sojourneth with thee, and would hold the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and hold it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land; but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">One law shall be for him that is home-born and for the sojourner that sojourneth among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And all the children of Israel did as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron; so did they.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And it came to pass on that same day, [that] Jehovah brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt according to their hosts.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Hallow unto me every firstborn, whatever breaketh open the womb among the children of Israel, of man and of cattle: it is mine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for with a powerful hand hath Jehovah brought you out from this; and nothing leavened shall be eaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Ye come out to-day, in the month Abib.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it shall be when Jehovah hath brought thee into the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, which he swore to thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread; and in the seventh day is a feast to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Unleavened bread shall be eaten the seven days; and leavened bread shall not be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy borders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And thou shalt inform thy son in that day, saying, It is because of what Jehovah did to me when I came out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it shall be for a sign to thee on thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth; for with a powerful hand hath Jehovah brought thee out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And thou shalt keep this ordinance at its set time from year to year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it shall be when Jehovah hath brought thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he hath sworn to thee and to thy fathers, and hath given it thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that thou shalt offer unto Jehovah all that breaketh open the womb, and every firstling that cometh of cattle which is thine: the males [shall be] Jehovah's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And every firstling of an ass shalt thou ransom with a lamb; and if thou do not ransom it, thou shalt break its neck; and every firstborn of a man among thy sons shalt thou ransom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say to him, With a powerful hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, that Jehovah slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of men and the firstborn of cattle: therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that breaketh open the womb being males; and every firstborn of my children I ransom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it shall be for a sign on thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes, for with a powerful hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, when Pharaoh let the people go, that God did not lead them the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, That the people may not repent when they see conflict, and return to Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And God led the people about, the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went arrayed out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for he had made the children of Israel swear an oath, saying, God will be sure to visit you; then ye shall carry my bones with you hence.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">The pillar of the cloud did not remove [from] before the people by day, nor the pillar of fire by night.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea: before Baal-Zephon, opposite to it, shall ye encamp by the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness has hemmed them in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he may pursue after them; and I will glorify myself in Pharaoh, and in all his host; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his bondmen was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from our service?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he yoked his chariot, and took his people with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; and the children of Israel had gone out with a high hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them where they had encamped by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, opposite to Baal-Zephon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Pharaoh approached; and the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and the children of Israel were much afraid, and cried out to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they said to Moses, Is it because there were no graves in Egypt, thou hast taken us away to die in the wilderness? why hast thou done this to us, that thou hast led us out of Egypt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Is not this what we told thee in Egypt, when we said, Let us alone, and we will serve the Egyptians? For [it had been] better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Moses said to the people, Fear not: stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work for you to-day; for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jehovah will fight for you, and ye shall be still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jehovah said to Moses, Why dost thou cry unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And thou, lift thy staff, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go on dry [ground] through the midst of the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall pursue after them; and I will glorify myself in Pharaoh and in all his host, in his chariots and in his horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have glorified myself in Pharaoh, in his chariots and in his horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before them, and stood behind them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and was a cloud and darkness, and lit up the night; and the one did not come near the other all the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah made the sea go [back] by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry [land], and the waters were divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the children of Israel went through the midst of the sea on the dry [ground]; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the Egyptians pursued and came after them all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots and his horsemen, into the midst of the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked upon the camp of the Egyptians, in the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and embarrassed the camp of the Egyptians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he took off their chariot wheels, and caused them to drive with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, Let us flee before Israel, for Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may return upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and upon their horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength toward the morning; and the Egyptians fled against it; and Jehovah overturned the Egyptians into the midst of the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen of all the host of Pharaoh that had come into the sea after them; there remained not even one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the children of Israel walked on dry [ground] through the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea-shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And Israel saw the great power [with] which Jehovah had wrought against the Egyptians; and the people feared Jehovah, and believed in Jehovah, and in Moses his bondman.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to Jehovah, and spoke, saying, I will sing unto Jehovah, for he is highly exalted: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">My strength and song is Jah, and he is become my salvation: This is my God, and I will glorify him; My father's God, and I will extol him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jehovah is a man of war; Jehovah, his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Pharaoh's chariots and his army hath he cast into the sea; His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The depths covered them; they sank to the bottom as a stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Thy right hand, Jehovah, is become glorious in power: Thy right hand, Jehovah, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And by the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown thine adversaries: Thou sentest forth thy burning wrath, it consumed them as stubble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And by the breath of thy nostrils the waters were heaped up; The streams stood as a mound; The depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my soul shall be sated upon them; I will unsheath my sword, my hand shall dispossess them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thou didst blow with thy breath, the sea covered them; They sank as lead in the mighty waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Who is like unto thee, Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like unto thee, glorifying thyself in holiness, Fearful [in] praises, doing wonders?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Thou by thy mercy hast led forth the people that thou hast redeemed; Thou hast guided them by thy strength unto the abode of thy holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The peoples heard it, they were afraid: A thrill seized the inhabitants of Philistia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the princes of Edom were amazed; The mighty men of Moab, trembling hath seized them; All the inhabitants of Canaan melted away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Fear and dread fall upon them; By the greatness of thine arm they are still as a stone; Till thy people pass over, Jehovah, Till the people pass over that thou hast purchased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, The place that thou, Jehovah, hast made thy dwelling, The Sanctuary, Lord, that thy hands have prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the horse of Pharaoh, with his chariots and with his horsemen, came into the sea, and Jehovah brought again the waters of the sea upon them; and the children of Israel went on dry [ground] through the midst of the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the tambour in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambours and with dances.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And they came to Marah, and could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore the name of it was called Marah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he cried to Jehovah; and Jehovah shewed him wood, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters became sweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance; and there he tested them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and do what is right in his eyes, and incline thine ears to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the complaints upon thee that I have put upon the Egyptians; for I am Jehovah who healeth thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And they journeyed from Elim, and the whole assembly of the children of Israel came into the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the whole assembly of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the children of Israel said to them, Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we ate bread to the full; for ye have brought us out into this wilderness, to kill this whole congregation with hunger!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said Jehovah to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather the daily need on its day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare what they have brought in; and it shall be twice as much as they shall gather daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, In the evening, then shall ye know that Jehovah has brought you out from the land of Egypt;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and in the morning, then shall ye see the glory of Jehovah; for he has heard your murmurings against Jehovah; and what are we, that ye murmur against us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Moses said, When Jehovah gives you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for Jehovah hears your murmurings which ye murmur against him and what [are] we? your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the children of Israel, Come near into the presence of Jehovah; for he has heard your murmurings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And it came to pass, when Aaron spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, that they turned toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak to them, saying, Between the two evenings ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And it came to pass in the evening, that quails came up, and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay round the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when the dew that lay [round it] was gone up, behold, on the face of the wilderness there was [something] fine, granular, fine as hoar-frost, on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the children of Israel saw [it], and said one to another, What is it? for they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which Jehovah has given you to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded: Gather of it every man according to what he can eat, an omer a poll, [according to] the number of your persons: ye shall take every man for those that are in his tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some much, some little.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they measured with the omer: then he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little wanted nothing: they had gathered every man according to the measure of his eating.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Moses said to them, Let no man leave [any] of it until the morning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But they did not hearken to Moses; and some men left of it until the morning; then worms bred in it and it stank. And Moses was wroth with them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said to them, This is what Jehovah has said: To-morrow is the rest, the holy sabbath, of Jehovah: bake what ye will bake, and cook what ye will cook; and lay up for yourselves all that remains over, to be kept for the morning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they laid it up for the morning, as Moses had commanded; and it did not stink, neither was there any worm in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Moses said, Eat it to-day; for to-day is sabbath to Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Six days shall ye gather it; but on the seventh day is sabbath: on it there shall be none.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehovah said to Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, into the land that I swore unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(and I will send an angel before thee, and dispossess the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">into a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiff-necked people, lest I consume thee on the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the people heard this evil word, they mourned; and no man put on his ornaments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Jehovah had said to Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked people: in one moment I will come up into the midst of thee and will consume thee. And now put off thine ornaments from thee, and I will know what I will do unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments at mount Horeb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Moses took the tent, and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the Tent of meeting. And it came to pass [that] every one who sought Jehovah went out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose up, and stood every man at the entrance of his tent, and they looked after Moses until he entered into the tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it came to pass when Moses entered into the tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the entrance of the tent, and [Jehovah] talked with Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent; and all the people rose and worshipped, every man at the entrance of his tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jehovah spoke with Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend. And he returned to the camp; but his attendant, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not from within the tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Moses said to Jehovah, Behold, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people; but thou dost not let me know whom thou wilt send with me; and thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in mine eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And now, if indeed I have found grace in thine eyes, make me now to know thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thine eyes; and consider that this nation is thy people!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, My presence shall go, and I will give thee rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said to him, If thy presence do not go, bring us not up hence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And how shall it be known then that I have found grace in thine eyes I and thy people? [Is it] not by thy going with us? so shall we be distinguished, I and thy people, from every people that is on the face of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jehovah said to Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast said; for thou hast found grace in mine eyes, and I know thee by name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said, Let me, I pray thee, see thy glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thy face, and I will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for Man shall not see me, and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Jehovah said, Behold, [there is] a place by me: there shalt thou stand on the rock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And it shall come to pass, when my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand, until I have passed by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see me from behind; but my face shall not be seen.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="34">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehovah said to Moses, Hew for thyself two tables of stone like the first; and I will write upon the tables the words that were upon the first tables, which thou hast broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And be ready for the morning, and go up in the morning to mount Sinai, and stand there before me on the top of the mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And let no man go up with thee, neither shall any man be seen on all the mountain; neither shall sheep and oxen feed in front of that mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he hewed two tables of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and stood beside him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jehovah passed by before his face, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in goodness and truth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">keeping mercy unto thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but by no means clearing [the guilty]; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, upon the third and upon the fourth [generation].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Moses made haste, and bowed his head to the earth and worshipped,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and said, If indeed I have found grace in thine eyes, Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in our midst; for it is a stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for an inheritance!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels that have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people in the midst of which thou [art] shall see the work of Jehovah; for a terrible thing it shall be that I will do with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Observe what I command thee this day: behold, I will drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Take heed to thyself, that thou make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which thou shalt come, lest it be a snare in the midst of thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">but ye shall demolish their altars, shatter their statues, and hew down their Asherahs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For thou shalt worship no other God; for Jehovah Jealous is his name is a jealous God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and then, when they go a whoring after their gods, and sacrifice unto their gods, thou be invited, and eat of their sacrifice,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Thou shalt make thyself no molten gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The feast of the unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I have commanded thee, at the appointed time of the month Abib; for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">All that openeth the womb [is] mine; and all the cattle that is born a male, the firstling of ox and sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the firstling of an ass thou shalt ransom with a lamb; and if thou ransom [it] not, then shalt thou break its neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt ransom; and none shall appear before me empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Six days shalt thou work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; in ploughing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they took them Moabitish wives; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the second Ruth: and they abode there about ten years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Mahlon and Chilion died also, both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And she arose, she and her daughters-in-law, and returned from the fields of Moab; for she had heard in the fields of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people to give them bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she had been, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">I went out full, and Jehovah has brought me home again empty. Why do ye call me Naomi, seeing Jehovah has brought me low, and the Almighty has afflicted me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the fields of Moab; and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of the barley-harvest.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Naomi had a relation of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And she went; and she came and gleaned in the fields after the reapers; and she chanced to light on an allotment of Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And Boaz said to his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose maiden is this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish maiden who came back with Naomi out of the fields of Moab;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers. And she came, and has continued from the morning until now: her sitting in the house has been little as yet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Boaz said to Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from here, but keep here with my maidens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let thine eyes be on the field which is being reaped, and go thou after them; have I not charged the young men not to touch thee? And when thou art athirst, go to the vessels and drink of what the young men draw.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favour in thine eyes, that thou shouldest regard me, seeing I am a foreigner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Boaz answered and said to her, It has fully been shewn me, all that thou hast done to thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come to a people that thou hast not known heretofore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jehovah recompense thy work, and let thy reward be full from Jehovah the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And she said, Let me find favour in thine eyes, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly to thy handmaid, though I am not like one of thy handmaidens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Boaz said to her at mealtime, Come hither and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers; and he reached her parched corn, and she ate and was sufficed, and reserved [some].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when she rose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and ye shall not reproach her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And ye shall also sometimes draw out for her [some ears] out of the handfuls, and leave them that she may glean, and rebuke her not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out what she had gleaned; and it was about an ephah of barley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And she took [it] up, and came into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had reserved after she was sufficed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And her mother-in-law said to her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou wrought? Blessed be he that did regard thee! And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead! And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to us, one of those who have the right of our redemption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said to me also, Thou shalt keep with my young men until they have ended all my harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So she kept with the maidens of Boaz to glean, until the end of the barley-harvest and of the wheat-harvest. And she dwelt with her mother-in-law.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And now, is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he is winnowing barley in the threshing-floor to-night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thyself, and put thy raiment upon thee, and go down to the floor; make not thyself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And she went down to the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law had bidden her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Boaz ate and drank, and his heart was merry, and he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn. Then she went softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid herself down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was startled, and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth, thy handmaid: spread thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou hast the right of redemption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, Blessed be thou of Jehovah, my daughter! Thou hast shewn more kindness at the end than at the first, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now, my daughter, fear not: all that thou sayest will I do to thee; for all the gate of my people knows that thou art a woman of worth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And now, truly I am one that has the right of redemption, yet there is one that has the right of redemption who is nearer than I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Stay over to-night, and it shall be in the morning, if he will redeem thee, well let him redeem; but if he like not to redeem thee, then will I redeem thee, [as] Jehovah liveth. Lie down until the morning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the threshing-floor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said, Bring the cloak that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And she held it, and he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid [it] on her; and he went into the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And she came to her mother-in-law; and she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And she said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then she said, Be still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest until he have completed the matter this day.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there. And behold, he that had the right of redemption, of whom Boaz had spoken, came by. And he said, Thou, such a one, turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside and sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit down here. And they sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said to him that had the right of redemption: Naomi, who is come back out of the country of Moab, sells the allotment that was our brother Elimelech's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I thought I would apprise thee of it and say, Buy [it] in the presence of the inhabitants, and in the presence of the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem [it], redeem; but if thou wilt not redeem, tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem besides thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Boaz said, On the day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy [it] also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And all the people that were in the gate and the elders said, [We are] witnesses. Jehovah make the woman that cometh into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; and acquire power in Ephratah, and make thyself a name in Bethlehem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and let thy house become like the house of Pherez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Jehovah shall give thee of this young woman.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">If they say thus to us, Stand still until we come to you, then we will stay in our place, and will not go up to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And if they say thus, Come up to us, then we will go up; for Jehovah has given them into our hand; and this shall be the sign to us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Now go and smite Amalek, and destroy utterly all that they have, and spare them not, but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Saul came to the city of the Amalekites, and set an ambush in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, and go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. And the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Saul smote Amalek from Havilah as thou comest to Shur, which is opposite to Egypt.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and oxen, and beasts of the second bearing, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not devote them to destruction; but everything that was mean and weak, that they destroyed utterly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the word of Jehovah came to Samuel, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned away from following me, and hath not fulfilled my words. And Samuel was much grieved; and he cried to Jehovah all night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set him up a monument, and has turned about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, Blessed art thou of Jehovah: I have fulfilled the word of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Samuel said, What [means] then this bleating of sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of oxen which I hear?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites, because the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Samuel said to Saul, Stay, that I may tell thee what Jehovah has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Why then didst thou not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, but didst fall upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of Jehovah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Saul said to Samuel, I have indeed hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the choicest of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Samuel said, Has Jehovah delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, As in hearkening to the voice of Jehovah? Behold, obedience is better than sacrifice, Attention than the fat of rams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For rebellion is [as] the sin of divination, And selfwill is [as] iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, He hath also rejected thee from being king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words; for I feared the people, and hearkened to their voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And now, I pray thee, forgive my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Samuel said to Saul, I will not turn again with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected thee from being king over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as Samuel turned to go away, [Saul] laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Samuel said to him, Jehovah has rent the kingdom of Israel from thee to-day, and has given it to thy neighbour, who is better than thou.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And also the Hope of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehovah said to Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Samuel said, How shall I go? if Saul hear [it], he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will tell thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Samuel did what Jehovah said, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came trembling to meet him, and said, Dost thou come peaceably?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah. Hallow yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he hallowed Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah's anointed is before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Jehovah said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him; for it is not as man seeth; for man looketh upon the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh upon the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, Jehovah has not chosen these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Samuel said to Jesse, Are these all the young men? And he said, There is yet the youngest remaining, and behold, he is feeding the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit at table till he come hither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he sent and brought him in. And he was ruddy, and besides of a lovely countenance and beautiful appearance. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren. And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubles thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let our lord now speak; thy servants are before thee: they shall seek out a man, a skilful player on a harp; and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And one of the young men answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skilled in playing, and he is a valiant man and a man of war, and skilled in speech, and of good presence, and Jehovah is with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And when David knew that Saul devised mischief against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; and I thy handmaid did not see the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And now, my lord, [as] Jehovah liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah has restrained thee from coming with bloodshed, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">So David received of her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was drunken to excess; so she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehovah sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The rich had very many flocks and herds;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but the poor man had nothing at all, but one little ewe lamb which he had bought, and was nourishing; and it grew up with him, and together with his children: it ate of his morsel, and drank of his own cup, and slept in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there came a traveller to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that had come to him; and he took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that had come to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that hath done this thing is worthy of death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man! Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if [that] had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah to do evil in his sight? thou hast smitten Urijah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Urijah the Hittite to be thy wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">But David saw that his servants whispered, and David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing, and entered into the house of Jehovah and worshipped; then he came to his own house and required them to set bread before him, and he ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And his servants said to him, What thing is this which thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child alive; but as soon as the child is dead, thou dost rise and eat bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I thought, Who knows? [perhaps] Jehovah will be gracious to me, that the child may live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David having a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar, Amnon the son of David loved her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed difficult for Amnon to do the least thing to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother; and Jonadab was a very shrewd man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said to him, Why dost thou, the king's son, get thinner from morning to morning? Wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jonadab said to him, Lay thee down on thy bed and feign thyself sick; and when thy father comes to see thee, say to him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Amnon lay down and feigned himself sick; and the king came to see him, and Amnon said to the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go, I pray thee, to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he had lain down. And she took flour and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Put every man out from me. And they went out every man from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the dish into the chamber, that I may eat of thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes that she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And she presented them to him to eat; and he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And she said to him, No, my brother, do not humble me; for no such thing is done in Israel: do not this infamy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I, whither shall I carry my reproach? and thou wouldest be as one of the infamous in Israel. And now, I pray thee, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But he would not hearken to her voice, and was stronger than she, and humbled her and lay with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Amnon hated her with an exceeding great hatred, for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And she said to him, There is no cause for this evil in sending me away, [which] is greater than the other that thou didst to me. But he would not hearken to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he called his young man that attended upon him, and said, Put now this [woman] out from me, and bolt the door after her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now she had a vest of many colours upon her; for so were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. And his attendant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon thy brother been with thee? and now, my sister, be still: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart. And Tamar remained, and [that] desolate, in her brother Absalom's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And king David heard of all these things, and he was very angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had humbled his sister Tamar.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon; then slay him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and they rode each upon his mule and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom has smitten all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their garments rent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he humbled his sister Tamar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And now let not my lord the king take the thing to heart, to say, All the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Absalom fled. And the young man that watched lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there came much people from the way behind him, from the hill-side.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">and come to the king, and speak after this manner to him. And Joab put the words into her mouth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up that which is good in his sight: see, [here are] oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-sledges and implements of the oxen for wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All these things, O king, doth Araunah give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, Jehovah thy God accept thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will in any case buy [them] of thee at a price: neither will I offer up to Jehovah my God burnt-offerings without cost. And David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And David built there an altar to Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. And Jehovah was propitious to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</VERS>
