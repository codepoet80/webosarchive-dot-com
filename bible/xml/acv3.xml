    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and besieged it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God. And he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in certain of the sons of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the ranking men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">youths in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and endued with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king's palace. And that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank. And that they should be nourished three years, that at the end of it they should stand before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now among these were, of the sons of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the ruler of the eunuchs gave names to them. To Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar, and to Hananiah, of Shadrach, and to Mishael, of Meshach, and to Azariah, of Abednego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank. Therefore he requested of the ruler of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now God made Daniel find kindness and compassion in the sight of the ruler of the eunuchs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the ruler of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink. For why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths that are of your own age? So ye would endanger my head with the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Daniel said to the steward whom the ruler of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Test thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king's food. And as thou see, deal with thy servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So he hearkened to them in this matter, and tested them ten days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared finer, and they were fuller in flesh, than all the youths who ate of the king's dainties.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So the steward took away their food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them vegetables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom. And Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the ruler of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the king conversed with them. And among them all none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they stood before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And in every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters who were in all his realm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams. And his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live forever. Tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me. If ye do not make the dream and the interpretation of it known to me, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if ye show the dream and the interpretation of it, ye shall receive gifts and rewards and great honor from me. Therefore show the dream and the interpretation of it to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would gain time, because ye see the thing has gone from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if ye do not make known to me the dream, there is but one law for you, for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me till the time is changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth who can show the king's matter. Inasmuch as no king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other who can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For this reason the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain. And they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, who went forth to kill the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret, that Daniel and his companions should nor perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the secret was shown to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and might are his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he changes the times and the seasons. He removes kings, and sets up kings. He gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those who have understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He reveals the deep and secret things. He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who has given me wisdom and might, and has now made known to me what we desired of thee, for thou have made known to us the king's matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Arioch brought Daniel in before the king in haste, and said thus to him: I have found a man of the sons of the captivity of Judah, who will make known the interpretation to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are thou able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation of it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded, neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, can show to the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets. And he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter. And he who reveals secrets has made known to thee what shall come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living man, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou may know the thoughts of thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Thou, O king, saw, and, behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee, and the appearance of it was fearful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Thou looked until a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, was broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors. And the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them. And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This is the dream, and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Thou, O king, are a king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And wherever the sons of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens, he has given into thy hand, and has made thee to rule over them all. Thou are the head of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things. And as iron that crushes all these, it shall break in pieces and crush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And whereas thou saw the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom. But there shall be of the strength of the iron in it, inasmuch as thou saw the iron mixed with miry clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And whereas thou saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men, but they shall not cling one to another, even as iron does not mix with clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And in the days of those kings the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty of it be left to another people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Inasmuch as thou saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. And the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since thou have been able to reveal this secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon, but Daniel was in the gate of the king.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up, and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he who does not fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thou, O king, have made a decree, that every man who shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he who does not fall down and worship, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There are certain Jews whom thou have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have not regarded thee. They do not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou have set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that ye do not serve my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, well. But if ye do not worship, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who is that god who shall deliver you out of my hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou have set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was accustomed to be heated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then these men were bound in their coats, their tunics, and their head coverings, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace very hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste. He spoke and said to his counselors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no harm. And the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace. He spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came forth out of the midst of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king's counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed. Neither were their coats changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his agent, and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speaks anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no other god who is able to deliver after this sort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has wrought toward me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">How great are his signs, and how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came in, and I told the dream before them, but they did not make the interpretation of it known to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. And I told the dream before him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubles thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height of it was great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The tree grew, and was strong, and the height of it reached to heaven, and the sight of it to the end of all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The leaves of it were fine, and the fruit of it much, and food was in it for all. The beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in the branches of it. And all flesh was fed from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches. Shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field. And let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given to him. And let seven times pass over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones, to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will, and sets up over it the lowest of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. And thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, inasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation. But thou are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken mute for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, may the dream be to those who hate thee, and the interpretation of it to thine adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The tree that thou saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to heaven, and the sight of it to all the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">whose leaves were fine, and the fruit of it much, and in it was food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">it is thou, O king, who have grown and become strong. For thy greatness has grown, and reaches to heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it. Nevertheless leave the stump of the roots of it in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field. And let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">That thou shall be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. And thou shall be made to eat grass as oxen, and shall be wet with the dew of heaven. And seven times shall pass over thee till thou know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, thy kingdom shall be sure to thee, after thou shall have known that the heavens do rule.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor, if there may be a lengthening of thy tranquility.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The king spoke and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling-place by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">While the word was in the king's mouth, a voice from heaven fell, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And thou shall be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. Thou shall be made to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The same hour the thing was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar. And he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen. And his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me. And I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him who lives forever. For his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing, and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth. And none can stay his hand, or say to him, What are thou doing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">At the same time my understanding returned to me, and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned to me, and my counselors and my lords sought to me. And I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, for all his works are truth, and his ways justice. And he is able to abase those who walk in pride.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Belshazzar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem, that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink from there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem. And the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In the same hour the fingers of a man's hand came forth, and wrote opposite the lampstand upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace. And the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the king's countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him. And the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation of it, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then king Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now the queen came into the banquet house because of the words of the king and his lords. The queen spoke and said, O king, live forever. Let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. And in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him. And the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">inasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, Are thou that Daniel, who are of the sons of the captivity of Judah, whom my father the king brought out of Judah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known to me the interpretation of it, but they could not show the interpretation of the thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But I have heard of thee, that thou can give interpretations, and dissolve doubts. Now if thou can read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation of it, thou shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another. Nevertheless I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom and greatness and glory and majesty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he wanted, he killed, and whom he wanted, he kept alive, and whom he wanted, he raised up, and whom he wanted, he put down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne. And they took his glory from him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and he was driven from the sons of men. And his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and that he sets up over it whomever he will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And thou his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled thy heart, though thou knew all this,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but have lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven. And they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine from them. And thou have praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor know. And the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, thou have not glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then the part of the hand was sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE, God has numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">TEKEL, thou are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">PERES, thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one, that these satraps might give account to them, and that the king should have no damage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him, and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom, but they could find no occasion nor fault, inasmuch as he was faithful, nor was there any error or fault found in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then these men said, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus to him: King Darius, live forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counselors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem) and he knelt upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did formerly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's interdict. Have thou not signed an interdict, that every man who shall make petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the sons of the captivity of Judah, does not regard thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him. And he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then these men assembled together to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou serve continually, he will deliver thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den. And the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting, nor were instruments of music brought before him. And his sleep fled from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when he came near to the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou serve continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">My God has sent his agent, and has shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me, inasmuch as before him innocence was found in me. And also before thee, O king, I have done no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of harm was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their sons, and their wives. And the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God, and steadfast forever. And his kingdom is that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed. Then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven broke forth upon the great sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings. I beheld till the wings of it were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And, behold, another beast, a second, like a bear, and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. And they said thus to it: Arise, devour much flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After this I saw in the night visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, fearful and powerful, and exceedingly strong. And it had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet. And it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I beheld till thrones were placed, and one who was ancient of days sat. His raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool. His throne was fiery flames, and the wheels of it burning fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him. Thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The judgment was set, and the books were opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke. I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away. Yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven someone like a son of man. And he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These great beasts, which are four, are four kings who shall arise out of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the sanctified of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all of them, exceedingly fearful, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass, which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose look was greater than its fellows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I beheld, and the same horn made war with the sanctified, and prevailed against them</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">until the ancient of days came. And judgment was given to the sanctified of the Most High, and the time came that the sanctified possessed the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise. And another shall arise after them, and he shall be different from the former. And he shall put down three kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the sanctified of the Most High. And he shall think to change the times and the law, and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the sanctified of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me much, and my countenance was changed in me, but I kept the matter in my heart.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I saw in the vision, now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam, and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns. And the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward, and no beasts could stand before him, nor was there any that could deliver out of his hand, but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and did not touch the ground. And the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I saw him come close to the ram. And he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns. And there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him. And there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly. And when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And it grew great, even to the host of heaven. And it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and trampled upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yea, it magnified itself, even to the Prince of the host. And it took away from him the continual burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through transgression. And it cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, How long shall be the vision of the continual burnt offering, and the transgression that make desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said to me, To two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be cleansed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it, and, behold, there stood before me someone as the appearance of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was frightened, and fell upon my face. But he said to me, Understand, O son of man, for the vision belongs to the time of the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground, but he touched me, and set me upright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation, for it belongs to the appointed time of the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The ram which thou saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece. And the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And as for that which was broken, in the place of which four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding hidden things, shall stand up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power, and he shall destroy amazingly, and shall prosper and do his pleasure. And he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And through his policy he shall cause deceit to prosper in his hand, and he shall magnify himself in his heart. And he shall destroy many in their security. He shall also stand up against the Prince of princes, but he shall be broken without a hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true. But shut thou up the vision, for it belongs to many days to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days. Then I rose up, and did the king's business. And I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years of which the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishing of the desolations of Jerusalem, even seventy years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I prayed to Jehovah my God, and made confession, and said, Oh, Lord, the great and fearful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from thy precepts and from thine ordinances,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">nor have we hearkened to thy servants the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings, our rulers, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">O Lord, righteousness belongs to thee, but to us confusion of face, as at this day, to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near, and who are far off, through all the countries where thou have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">O Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our kings, to our rulers, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">nor have we obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside, that they should not obey thy voice. Therefore the curse has been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God. For we have sinned against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil, for under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done upon Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us. Yet we have not entreated the favor of Jehovah our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in thy truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore Jehovah has watched over the evil, and brought it upon us, for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he does, and we have not obeyed his voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And now, O Lord our God, who has brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and has gotten thee renown, as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, let thine anger and thy wrath, I pray thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain. Because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people have become a reproach to all who are round about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now therefore, O our God, hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">O my God, incline thine ear, and hear. Open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name. For we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness, but for thy great mercies' sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">O Lord, hear. O Lord, forgive. O Lord, hearken and do. Defer not, for thine own sake, O my God, because thy city and thy people are called by thy name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he instructed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I have now come forth to give thee wisdom and understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment went forth, and I have come to tell thee, for thou are greatly beloved. Therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the anointed one, the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks. It shall be built again, with street and moat, even in troublesome times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And after the sixty-two weeks the anointed one shall be cut off, and shall have nothing. And the people of the prince who shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary, and the end of it shall be with a flood. And even to the end shall be war; desolations are determined.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week. And in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease. And upon the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate. And even to the full end, and that determined, wrath shall be poured out upon the desolate.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar, and the thing was true, even a great warfare. And he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I ate no pleasant bread. Neither flesh nor wine came into my mouth. Neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And in the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I lifted up my eyes, and looked. And, behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Also his body was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great quaking fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So I was left alone, and saw this great vision. And there remained no strength in me, for my fitness was turned in me into debility, and I retained no strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yet I heard the voice of his words. And when I heard the voice of his words, then I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said to me, O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to thee, and stand upright, for I am now sent to thee. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood, trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then he said to me, Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that thou set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard. And I have come for thy words' sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the ruler of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days, but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me. And I remained there with the kings of Persia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have come now to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days, for the vision is yet for many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when he had spoken to me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was mute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And, behold, someone in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to him who stood before me, O my lord, because of the vision my pains have turned upon me, and I retain no strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? For as for me, straightaway there remained no strength in me, nor was there breath left in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then someone like the appearance of a man touched me again, and he strengthened me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not. Peace be to thee. Be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spoke to me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak, for thou have strengthened me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then he said, Do thou know why I have come to thee? And now I will return to fight with the ruler of Persia. And when I go forth, lo, the ruler of Greece shall come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth. And there is none who holds with me against these, but Michael your prince.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And now I will show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia, and the fourth shall be far richer than them all. And when he has grown strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And a mighty king shall stand up, who shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion with which he ruled, for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his rulers. And he shall be powerful over him, and have dominion. His dominion shall be a great dominion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And at the end of years they shall join themselves together. And the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement, but she shall not retain the strength of her arm, nor shall he stand, nor his arm. But she shall be given up, and also those who brought her, and he who begot her, and he who strengthened her in those times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But out of a shoot from her roots shall a man stand up in his place, who shall come to the army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And also their gods, with their molten images, and with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, he shall carry captive into Egypt, and he shall refrain from the king of the north some years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And his sons shall war, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on, and overflow, and pass through. And they shall return and war, even to his fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north. And he shall set forth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the multitude shall be lifted up, and his heart shall be exalted. And he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and he shall come on at the end of the times, even of years, with a great army and with much substance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And in those times many shall stand up against the king of the south. Also the sons of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision, but they shall fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city. And the forces of the south shall not stand, nor his chosen people. Neither shall there be any strength to stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But he who comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him. And he shall stand in the glorious land, and in his hand shall be destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions, and he shall perform them. And he shall give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her, but she shall not stand, nor be for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">After this he shall turn his face to the isles, and shall take many. But a ruler shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease. Yea, moreover, he shall cause his reproach to turn upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then someone shall stand up in his place who shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom, but within a few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And in his place he who is contemptible shall stand up, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom. But he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him, and shall be broken, yea, also the ruler of the covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And after the league made with him, he shall work deceitfully, for he shall come up, and shall become strong, with a small people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He shall come in time of security even upon the fattest places of the province, and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers. He shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance. Yea, he shall devise his devices against the strongholds, even for a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army. And the king of the south shall war in battle with a very great and mighty army, but he shall not stand, for they shall devise devices against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Yea, those who eat of his food shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow, and many shall fall down slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table. But it shall not prosper, for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then he shall return into his land with great substance. And his heart shall be against the holy covenant, and he shall do his pleasure, and return to his own land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south, but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For ships of Kittim shall come against him. Therefore he shall be grieved, and shall return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and shall do his pleasure. He shall even return, and have regard to those who forsake the holy covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And forces shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and shall take away the continual burnt offering, and they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And he shall pervert by flatteries such as do wickedly against the covenant. But the people who know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And those who are wise among the people shall instruct many, yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help, but many shall join themselves to them with flatteries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And some of those who are wise shall fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end, because it is yet for the time appointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the king shall do according to his will. And he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods. And he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished, for that which is determined shall be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god, for he shall magnify himself above all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But in his place he shall honor the god of fortresses. And a god whom his fathers did not know, he shall honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god. Whoever acknowledges him he will increase with glory, and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for a price.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And at the time of the end, the king of the south shall contend with him, and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships, and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass through.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He shall also enter into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown. But these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the sons of Ammon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt. And the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But news out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him, and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and to utterly sweep away many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain, yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Then I, Daniel, looked, and, behold, another two stood, the one on the brink of the river on this side, and the other on the brink of the river on that side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him who lives forever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half. And when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Jehovah that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When Jehovah spoke at the first by Hosea, Jehovah said to Hosea, Go, take to thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom, for the land commits great whoredom, departing from Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived, and bore him a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jehovah said to him, Call his name Jezreel, for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And Jehovah said to him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah, for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, that I should in any way pardon them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">But Jehovah sent out a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was about to be broken.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground brings forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. And I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them. And the horses and their riders shall come down, each one by the sword of his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In that day, says Jehovah of hosts, I will take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, says Jehovah, and will make thee as a signet. For I have chosen thee, says Jehovah of hosts.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same, my name is great among the Gentiles. And in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering. For my name is great among the Gentiles, says Jehovah of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of Jehovah is polluted. And the fruit of it, even its food, is contemptible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Ye also say, Behold, what a weariness it is! And ye have sniffed at it, says Jehovah of hosts. And ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick. Thus ye bring the offering. Should I accept this at your hand? says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But cursed be the deceiver, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing. For I am a great King, says Jehovah of hosts, and my name is feared among the Gentiles.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass when Jesus finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, having sent two of his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">he said to him, Are thou he who comes, or do we look for another man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And having answered, Jesus said to them, After going, report to John the things that ye hear and see:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor are proclaimed good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And blessed is he, whoever will not be caused to stumble by me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And while those men departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes about John, What did ye go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But what did ye go out to see? A man clothed in delicate clothes? Behold, those wearing delicate things are in king's houses.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Woe to thee, Chorazin! Woe to thee, Bethsaida! Because if the mighty works that occurred in you occurred in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And on that day, having departed from the house, Jesus was sitting beside the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And many multitudes were gathered to him, so as for him (having entered in) to sit in the boat, and all the multitude had stood on the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the man who sows went forth to sow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much soil, and straightaway they sprang up because they had no depth of soil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when the sun was risen, they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And others fell in the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He who has ears, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the disciples having come, they said to him, Why do thou speak to them in parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And having answered, he said to them, Because it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to those men it has not been given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever has not, even what he has will be taken away from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Because of this I speak to them in parables, because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, nor do they understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which says, By hearing ye will hear, and will, no, not understand, and seeing ye will see, and will, no, not perceive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this people's heart became fat, and their ears hear heavily, and their eyes are shut, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should turn, and I will heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But blessed are your eyes, because they see, and your ears, because they hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For truly I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men longed to see the things that ye see, and did not see them, and to hear the things that ye hear, and did not hear them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Hear ye then the parable of the man who sows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Of every man who hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, evil comes, and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is that which was sown by the wayside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And that which was sown upon the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and straightaway receiving it with joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">yet he has no root in himself, instead it is temporary. And when tribulation or persecution develops because of the word, straightaway he is caused to stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And that which was sown in the thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the care of this age, and the deceitfulness of wealth, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But that which was sown upon the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who indeed bears fruit, and is productive, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He set forth another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man sowing good seed in his field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat, and went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares also appeared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But the bondmen of the house-ruler having come, they said to him, Sir, did thou not sow good seed in thy field? From where then does it have tares?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he said to them, A hostile man did this. And the bondmen said to him, Do thou desire therefore, after going, we would gather them up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he said, No, lest while gathering up the tares, ye uproot the wheat together with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Allow both to grow together until the harvest. And at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles in order to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He set forth another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard plant, which having taken, a man sowed in his field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Which indeed is smaller than all seeds, but when it is grown, it is greater than the plants, and becomes a tree, so as for the birds of the sky to come and lodge in the branches of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He spoke another parable to them. The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which having taken, a woman hid in three measures of meal until it was all leavened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes, and he did not speak to them independent of a parable,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says, I will open my mouth in parables. I will utter things concealed from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then having sent the multitudes away, Jesus came into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And having answered, he said to them, He who sows the good seed is the Son of man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and the field is the world, and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are agents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned in fire, so it will be at the end of this age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Son of man will send forth his agents, and they will gather out of his kingdom all the stumbling-blocks, and those doing lawlessness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Again the kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man having found, he hid. And from the joy of it, he goes and sells all, as many things as he has, and buys that field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a merchant, seeking fine pearls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Who, having found one very valuable pearl, after departing, sold all, as many things as he had, and bought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered from every kind,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">which, when it was full, after dragging to the shore, having sat down, they gathered the good into vessels, but they cast out the useless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">So it will be at the end of the age. The agents will come forth, and separate the bad from among the righteous,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yes, Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And he said to them, Because of this every scholar who has been instructed in the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a house-ruler, who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these parables, he departed from there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And having come into his fatherland he taught them in their synagogue, so as for them to be astonished, and say, From where is this wisdom and powers in this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James and Joses and Simon and Judas?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And his sisters, are they not all near us? From where then are all these things in this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And they were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his fatherland, and in his house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">And they besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment. And as many as touched were healed.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then scholars and Pharisees from Jerusalem come to Jesus, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And having answered, he said to them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God, because of your tradition?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father and thy mother, and, He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him perish in death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But ye say, Whoever may say to the father or the mother, Whatever thou might have benefited from me is an offering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he will, no, not honor his father or mother. And ye have annulled the command of God because of your tradition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This people comes near me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips, but their heart is far distant from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And in vain they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And having called in the multitude, he said to them, Hear and understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Not that which enters into the mouth defiles the man, but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then having come near, his disciples said to him, Know thou that the Pharisees were offended when they heard the saying?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But having answered, he said, Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant, will be uprooted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Leave them. They are blind leaders of blind men, and if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a ditch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And having answered, Peter said to him, Explain this parable to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jesus said, Are ye also still without understanding?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Do ye not yet understand, that everything entering into the mouth goes into the belly, and is cast out into a toilet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the things coming out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and those things defile the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For from the heart comes forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, revilings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">These are things defiling the man. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And having gone out from there, Jesus departed into the regions of Tyre and Sidon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And behold, a Canaanite woman having come out from those regions, cried out to him, saying, Be merciful to me, O Lord, thou son of David, my daughter is grievously demon-possessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he answered her not a word. And his disciples having approached, they besought him, saying, Send her away, because she cries out behind us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But having answered, he said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But having come, she worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And having answered, he said, It is not right to take the children's bread and cast it to the house dogs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But she said, Yes, Lord, for even the house dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Jesus having answered, said to her, O woman, great is thy faith. Be it done for thee as thou desire. And her daughter was healed from that hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And having departed from there, Jesus came near the sea of Galilee. And having gone up onto the mountain, he sat there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And many multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, crippled, and many others. And they placed them beside Jesus' feet, and he healed them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">so as for the multitudes to marvel seeing the mute speaking, the maimed healthy, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Jesus having summoned his disciples, he said, I feel compassion toward the multitude because they continue with me now three days and do not have what they might eat. And I do not want to dismiss them without food, lest they might faint on the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And his disciples say to him, From where are so many loaves for us in a wilderness so as to feed so great a multitude?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus says to them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And after taking the seven loaves and the fishes, having expressed thanks, he broke in pieces, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they all ate and were filled. And they took up seven hampers full of the fragments that remained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And having dismissed the multitudes, he entered into the boat, and came into the regions of Magdala.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the Pharisees and Sadducees who came, testing, demanded him to exhibit to them a sign from the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But having answered, he said to them, When it becomes evening, ye say, Fair weather, for the sky is red.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And at morning, Bad weather today, for the sky is red, being gloomy. Hypocrites! Ye indeed know how to discern the face of the sky, but the signs of the times ye are not able.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet. And having left them behind, he departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And his disciples having come to the other side, they forgot to take loaves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jesus said to them, Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they deliberated among themselves, saying, We took no loaves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And having known it, Jesus said to them, O ye of little faith, why do ye deliberate among yourselves because ye brought no loaves?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many hampers ye took up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">How do ye not understand that I spoke to you not about bread, to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they understood that he said not to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when Jesus came into the regions of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say I, the Son of man, am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they said, Some, John the immerser, others, Elijah, but others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He says to them, But who say ye, I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Simon Peter having answered, said, Thou are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And having answered, Jesus said to him, Blessed are thou, Simon Bar-jonah, because flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I also say to thee, that thou are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever thou may bind on earth will be what is bound in the heavens, and whatever thou may loose on the earth will be what is loosed in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then he commanded his disciples that they should tell no man that he is Jesus, the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders, and chief priests, and scholars, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And having taken him aside, Peter began to rebuke him, saying, Be merciful to thee, Lord. This will, no, not be to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But having turned around, he said to Peter, Go thee behind me, Satan. Thou are my stumbling-block, because thou regard not the things of God, but the things of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Jesus said to his disciples, If any man wants to come behind me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For whoever wants save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For what does it profit a man, if he should gain the whole world, and lose his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the Son of man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his agents, and then he will reward each man according to his actions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Truly I say to you, there are some of those who stand here, who will, no, not taste of death, until they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after six days Jesus takes Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up onto a high mountain in private.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And having responded, Peter said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If thou desire, we could make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were exceedingly afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And having come, Jesus touched them and said, Arise, and fear not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And having lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, except Jesus only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And while they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man will rise from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And his disciples questioned him, saying, Why then do the scholars say that Elijah must first come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And having answered, Jesus said to them, Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But I say to you, that Elijah already came, and they knew him not, but did to him how many things they wanted. Likewise also the Son of man is going to suffer by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them about John the immerser.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling to him, and saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Lord, be merciful to my son, because he is lunatic, and suffers badly. For he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not heal him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And having answered, Jesus said, O faithless and perverted generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him here to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus rebuked it, and the demon departed from him. And the boy was cured from that hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the disciples having come to Jesus in private, said, Why could we not cast it out?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief. For truly I say to you, if ye have faith as a grain of a mustard plant, ye will say to this mountain, Remove from here to there, and it will depart, and nothing will be impossible to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And while they turned back in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is going to be delivered into the hands of men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up. And they were exceedingly sorry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they came to Capernaum, those who receive the double-drachma came to Peter, and said, Does not your teacher pay the double-drachma?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He says, Yes. And when he entered into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What think thou, Simon? The kings of the earth, from whom do they take taxes or tribute, from their sons or from strangers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Therefore the sons are free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But, so that we might not offend them, after going to the sea, cast a hook. And take up the first fish coming up, and having opened its mouth, thou will find a four-drachma coin. After taking that, give thou to them for me and thee.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greater in the kingdom of the heavens?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And having called in a child, Jesus set it in the midst of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said, Truly I say to you, if ye are not turned, and become as children, ye will, no, not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He therefore who will make himself lowly as this child, this man is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And whoever will receive one such child in my name receives me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But whoever may cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it is advantageous for him that a donkey-powered millstone were hanged on his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Woe to the world because of stumbling-blocks. For it is necessary that the stumbling-blocks come, yet woe to that man through whom the stumbling-block comes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And if thy hand or thy foot causes thee to stumble, cut them off and cast from thee. It is good for thee to enter into life crippled or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And if thine eye causes thee to stumble, remove it and cast it from thee. It is good for thee to enter into life one-eyed, than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">See that ye not disparage one of these little ones, for I say to you, that in the heavens their agents do always behold the face of my Father in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the Son of man came to save that which was lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">What does it seem to you? If it happens a hundred sheep are with some man, and one of them went astray, after going (having left the ninety-nine on the mountains), does he not seek the one going astray?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you, that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So, it is not a purpose before your Father in the heavens, that one of these little ones should perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if thy brother should sin against thee, go and reprove him between thee and him alone. If he should hear thee, thou have gained thy brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if he should not hear, take with thee one or two besides, so that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if he is heedless of them, speak to the church. But if he is also heedless of the church, let him be to thee as the heathen and the tax collector.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Truly I say to you, however many things ye may bind on the earth will be things that are bound in heaven, and however many things ye may loose on the earth will be things that that are loosed in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Again I say to you truly, that if two of you should agree on the earth concerning every matter, whatever they might ask, it will happen for them from my Father in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Peter having come to him, he said, Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus says to him, I say to thee, not until seven times, but until seventy times seven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Because of this the kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man, a king, who wanted to settle account with his bondmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when he began to settle, one debtor of ten thousand talents was brought to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But of him not having to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all things, as many as he had, and payment to be made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The bondman therefore having fallen down, worshiped him, saying, Lord, be patient toward me and I will pay thee all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And having felt compassion, the lord of that bondman released him, and forgave him the debt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But after going out, that bondman found one of his fellow bondmen who owed him a hundred denarii. And having grabbed him, he choked him, saying, Pay me if thou owe anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So his fellow bondman having fallen down at his feet, besought him, saying, Be patience toward me, and I will pay thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But he would not, instead, having left him, he cast him into prison until he would pay that which was owed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when his fellow bondmen saw the things that happened, they were extremely sorry. And after coming, they reported to their lord all the things that happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then his lord having summoned him, he says to him, Thou evil bondman, I forgave thee all that debt because thou besought me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Was it not necessary for thee also to be merciful to thy fellow bondman, as I also was merciful to thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And having become angry, his lord delivered him to the tormentors until he would pay all that was due to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if ye do not forgive each man his brother, from your hearts, their trespasses.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee and came into the regions of Judea beyond the Jordan.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Pharisees came to him, trying him, and saying to him, Is it permitted for a man to divorce his wife for every cause?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And having answered, he said to them, Have ye not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and said, For this reason a man will leave his father and mother behind, and will be bonded with his wife, and the two will be in one flesh?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, no man shall separate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They say to him, Why then did Moses command to give a writing of divorcement, and to divorce her?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He says to them, For your hard heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it did not happen this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I say to you, that whoever may divorce his wife, not for fornication, and will marry another, commits adultery. And he who married her who has been divorced commits adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">His disciples say to him, If the case of the man with his wife is this way, it is not advantageous to marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But he said to them, Not all men can accommodate this saying, but to whom it has been given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For there are eunuchs who were born this way from their mother's belly, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then children were brought to him, so that he would lay his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Jesus said, Allow the children, and do not forbid them to come to me, for of such kind is the kingdom of the heavens.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And behold one man having come to him, said, Good teacher, what good thing should I do so that I may have eternal life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to him, Why do thou call me good? There is none good except one, God. But if thou want to enter into life, keep the commandments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He says to him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shall not murder. Thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shall not steal. Thou shall not testify falsely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Honor the father and mother, and, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The young man says to him, All these things I have kept from my youthfulness. What do I lack yet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus said to him, If thou want to be perfect, go, sell the things being possessed by thee, and give to the poor, and thou will have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sorrowing, for he was having many possessions.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">For the kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man, a house-ruler, who went out in the early morning at the same time to hire workmen for his vineyard.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said to those men, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever would be right I will give you, and they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Again having gone out about the sixth and the ninth hour, he did likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And having gone out about the eleventh hour, he found others who have stood idle. And he says to them, Why have ye stood here idle the whole day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They say to him, Because no man has hired us. He says to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever would be right ye will receive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And having become evening, the lord of the vineyard says to his manager, Call the workmen, and render to them their wage, having begun from the last until the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And those who came about the eleventh hour, each received a denarius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more. And they also received a denarius each.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when they received it, they murmured against the house-ruler,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said to her, What do thou want? She says to him, Speak that these my two sons may sit, one at thy right hand and one at thy left hand in thy kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But having answered, Jesus said, Ye know not what ye are asking. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am going to drink, or to be immersed the immersion that I am immersed? They say to him, We are able.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he says to them, Ye will indeed drink my cup, and ye will be immersed the immersion that I am immersed. But to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but to whom it has been prepared by my Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when the ten heard it, they were indignant about the two brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But having summoned them, Jesus said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord over them, and their eminent men have power over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But it shall not be so among you. Rather whoever wants to become great among you, he shall be your helper,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">Just as the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And behold, two blind men sitting by the wayside, having heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Be merciful to us, Lord, thou son of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the multitude rebuked them, so that they would be quiet, but they cried out greater, saying, Be merciful to us, Lord, thou son of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And having stood still, Jesus called them and said, What do ye want that I would do to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And having felt compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and straightaway they received their sight, and followed him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when they came near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethsphage, to the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and straightaway ye will find a donkey tied, and a colt with it. Having loosed them, bring to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And if any man says anything to you, ye will say, The Lord has need of them, and straightaway he will send them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now all this came to pass, so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King comes to thee, meek, and mounted upon a donkey, and a colt the foal of a pack animal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the disciples having gone, and having done as Jesus commanded them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">they brought the donkey and the colt, and put their garments over them. And he sat upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the great multitude spread their garments on the road, and others cut down branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the multitudes who went ahead and those who followed, cried out, saying, Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when he entered into Jerusalem, all the city was shaken, saying, Who is this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the multitudes said, This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all those who sold and bought in the temple. And he overturned the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of those who sold the doves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he says to them, It is written, My house will be called a house of prayer, but ye made it a den of robbers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the lame and the blind came to him in the temple, and he healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when the chief priests and the scholars saw the wonderful things that he did, and the boys crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David, they were indignant,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and said to him, Do thou hear what these are saying? And Jesus says to them, Yes! Did ye never read, Out of the mouth of children and those who suckle thou have perfected praise?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And having left them behind, he went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now early while returning to the city, he was hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And having seen a fig tree, one on the way, he came to it, and found nothing on it, except leaves only. And he says to it, Let fruit no longer be produced from thee into the age. And immediately the fig tree dried out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree dry out immediately?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And having answered, Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, if ye have faith, and doubt not, ye will not only do that of the fig tree, but even if ye may say to this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it will happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And all things, as many as ye may ask in prayer, believing, ye will receive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when he came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him while he taught, saying, By what authority do thou these things? And who gave thee this authority?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And having answered, Jesus said to them, I also will ask you one word, which if ye tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The immersion of John, from where was it, from heaven or from men? And they deliberated with themselves, saying, If we should say, From heaven, he will say to us, Why then did ye not believe him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But if we should say, From men, we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And having answered Jesus, they said, We know not. He said to them, And neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But what does it seem to you? A man had two children. And having come to the first, he said, Child, go work today in my vineyard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And having answered, he said, I do not want to, but having repented later, he went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And having come to the second, he said likewise. And having answered, he said, I, sir, and did not go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Which of the two did the will of the father? They say to him, The first. Jesus says to them, Truly I say to you, that the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For John came to you in a way of righteousness, and ye did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him. And having seen it, ye did not repent afterward to believe him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Hear ye another parable. There was a certain man who was a house-ruler, who planted a vineyard, and placed a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and leased it to farmers, and went on a journey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when the time of the fruits approached, he sent his bondmen to the farmers to receive his fruits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the farmers having taken his bondmen, they beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Again, he sent other bondmen more than the first, and they did to them in like manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But finally he sent to them his son, saying, They will be made ashamed by my son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, and possess his inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And having seized him, they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They say to him, Evil men, he will miserably destroy them, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will render him the fruits in their seasons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jesus says to them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone that those who build rejected, this came to be in the head of the corner. This happened from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Because of this I say to you, that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation producing the fruits of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he who falls on this stone will be shattered, but on whomever it may fall, it will grind him to dust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he spoke about them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And when they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they held him as a prophet.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And having responded, Jesus again spoke to them in parables, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a king who made a wedding for his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he sent forth his bondmen to call those who were invited to the wedding festivities, and they did not want to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Again he sent forth other bondmen, saying, Speak to those who were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and my fatlings have been killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding festivities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But having disregarded, they departed, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and the others having seized his bondmen, abused and killed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But having heard that, the king was angry, and having sent forth his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then he says to his bondmen, The wedding is indeed ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Go ye therefore to the crossings of the ways, and as many as ye may find, call to the wedding festivities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And those bondmen having departed into the roads, they gathered together all, as many as they found, both bad and good. And the wedding was filled with those who were dining.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when the king came in to see those who were dining, he saw there a man who was not clothed with a wedding garment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he says to him, Friend, how did thou come in here not having a wedding garment? But he was speechless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the king said to the helpers, After binding him hands and feet, take him away and cast him out into the outer darkness. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For many are called, but few chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the Pharisees having departed, they took counsel how they might trap him in his talk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they send out their disciples to him, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou are true, and teach the way of God in truth, and it is not a concern to thee about a man, for thou look not to the personage of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Tell us therefore, what does it seem to thee? Is it permitted to give tribute to Caesar or not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But Jesus having known their wickedness, said, Why do ye tempt me, ye hypocrites?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Exhibit to me the tribute money. And they brought to him a denarius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he says to them, Whose is this image and inscription?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They say to him, Caesar's. Then he says to them, Therefore, render the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when they heard it, they marveled. And having left him, they departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">On that day Sadducees came to him, those who claim to be no resurrection. And they questioned him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Teacher, Moses said, If some man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now there were with us seven brothers. And the first having married perished. And having no seed left his wife to his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Likewise also the second, and the third, until the seventh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And last of all, the woman also died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">In the resurrection therefore, which of the seven will she be wife? For they all had her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But having answered, Jesus said to them, Ye are led astray, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as agents of God in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not God of the dead, but of the living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his doctrine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But the Pharisees, having heard that he silenced the Sadducees, they came together in the same place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And one of them, a lawyer, questioned, trying him, and saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Jesus said to him, Thou shall love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">This is the first and great commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the second is like it, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus interrogated them, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">What does it seem to you about the Christ? Whose son is he? They say to him, Of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He says to them, How then does David in Spirit call him Lord, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I place thine enemies a footstool of thy feet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">If David therefore calls him Lord, how is he his son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And no man was able to answer him a word, nor did any man from that day dare to question him any more.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The scholars and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All things therefore, however many they may tell you to observe, observe and do, but do not ye according to their works, for they say, and do not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For they bind heavy burdens and difficult to bear, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they do not want to move them with their finger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But all their works they do in order to be seen by men. And they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the hems of their garments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they love the chief place at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and the greetings in the marketplaces, and to be designated by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But be ye not designated Rabbi, for one is your leader, the Christ, and ye are all brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And do not designate a father of you upon the earth, for one is your Father, he in the heavens.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye close up the kingdom of the heavens ahead of men. For ye enter not in, nor do ye allow those who are entering to enter in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye devour widows' houses, and praying long in pretence. Because of this ye will receive greater condemnation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye encompass the sea and the land to make one proselyte, and when it happens, ye make him twice more a son of hell than yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Woe to you, ye blind guides, who say, Whoever may swear by the temple, it is nothing, but whoever may swear by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye tithe the mint and the anise and the cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law-justice and mercy and faith. These things must be done, and not neglecting those things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Ye blind guides, who strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Woe to you, scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but inside they are full of plunder and unrighteousness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins, who, having taken their lamps, went forth to the bridegroom's gathering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And five of them were wise, and five were foolish,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">foolish women, who, having taken their lamps, took no olive oil with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the wise took olive oil in their vessels with their lamps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But at midnight a shout occurred, Behold, the bridegroom comes! Go ye forth for his gathering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then all those virgins were roused, and put their lamps in order.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the foolish said to the wise, Give us from your olive oil, because our lamps are going out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But the wise answered, saying, Perhaps there may not be enough for us and you. But go ye rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. And the prepared entered in with him for the wedding festivities, and the door was shut.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But afterward the other virgins also came, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But having answered, he said, Truly I say to you, I know you not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Watch therefore, because ye know not the day nor the hour in which the Son of man comes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For, like a man going on a journey, he called his own bondmen, and delivered to them the things possessed by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his personal ability, and straightaway he journeyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And having departed, the man who received the five talents worked with them, and made five other talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And likewise also the man of the two gained two others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But having departed, the man who received the one dug in the ground, and hid his lord's silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now after a long time the lord of those bondmen comes, and takes up accounting with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And having come, the man who received the five talents brought five other talents, saying, Lord, thou delivered five talents to me, lo, I have gained five other talents besides them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And his lord said to him, Well, good and faithful bondman. Thou were faithful over a few things, I will appoint thee over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And he will truly place the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then the King will say to those at his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat. I was thirsty, and ye gave me to drink. I was a stranger, and ye took me in,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">naked, and ye clothed me. I was feeble, and ye came to help me. I was in prison, and ye came to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then the righteous will answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungering, and fed thee, or thirsting, and gave thee drink?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in, or naked, and clothed thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when did we see thee weak, or in prison, and came to thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And having answered, the King will say to them, Truly I say to you, inasmuch as ye did it to one of these my brothers, the least, ye did it to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then he will also say to those at the left hand, Depart from me, ye accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his agents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat, I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">I was a stranger, and ye did not take me in, naked, and ye did not clothe me, weak, and in prison, and ye did not come to help me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Then they will also answer, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or weak, or in prison, and did not serve thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he will answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of these least, ye did it not to me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these saying, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ye know that after two days the Passover comes, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the chief priests, and the scholars, and the elders of the people, assembled together to the courtyard of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and they deliberated so that they might take Jesus by trickery, and kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they said, Not during the feast, lest an uproar develop among people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when Jesus happened to be in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">a woman came to him having an alabaster cruse of precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head as he sat relaxing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But when his disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, Why this waste?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For this ointment could have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Jesus knowing it, he said to them, Why do ye cause troubles to the woman? For she has wrought a good work upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For ye always have the poor with you, but ye do not always have me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For by pouring this ointment upon my body, she did it for my burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Truly I say to you, wherever this good news may be proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman did will also be told for a memorial of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, having gone to the chief priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">he said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they weighed out to him thirty silver pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And from that time he sought a favorable opportunity so that he might betray him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where do thou want that we should prepare for thee to eat the Passover?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said, Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, The teacher says, My time is near. I keep the Passover with my disciples with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the disciples did as Jesus arranged for them, and they prepared the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now having become evening, he was sitting with the twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And as they were eating, he said, Truly I say to you, that one of you will betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And being exceedingly sorrowful, they began, each of them, to say to him, Is it I, Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having answered, he said, He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, this man will betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Son of man indeed goes as it is written about him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It were good for him if that man had not been born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Judas (the man who betrayed him) having answered, he said, Is it I, Rabbi? He says to him, Thou have said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken bread, having expressed thanks, broke in pieces, and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is my body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And having taken the cup, having expressed thanks, he gave to them, saying, All ye drink of it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed on behalf of many for remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But I say to you, that I will, no, not drink of this fruit of the grapevine henceforth until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Jesus says to them, All ye will be caused to stumble by me in this night, for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But having answered, Peter said to him, If all men will be caused to stumble by thee, I will never be caused to stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to him, Truly I say to thee, that in this night, before a cock sounds, thou will deny me thrice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter says to him, Even if I must die with thee, I will, no, not deny thee. And likewise also, said all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he says to his disciples, Sit ye here until, after going, I may pray there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And having taken Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and distressed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then Jesus says to them, My soul is deeply grieved, as far as of death. Remain ye here and watch with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And having gone forward a little, he fell on his face praying, and saying, My Father, if it be possible, may this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I want, but as thou.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he comes to the disciples, and finds them sleeping. And he says to Peter, So ye could not watch with me one hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation. Truly, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Having gone again a second time, he prayed, saying, My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to pass from me, except I drink it, may thy will happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And having come again, he finds them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And when he left them, having gone away again, he prayed a third time, saying again the same statement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he comes to his disciples, and says to them, Sleep what remains, and take rest. Behold, the hour has come near, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Awake, we go. Behold, he who betrays me has come near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And while he was still speaking, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priest and elders of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Now the man who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I may kiss is he. Seize him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And straightaway having come to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi, and kissed him much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus said to him, Friend, why are thou here? Then having come, they threw their hands on Jesus, and seized him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And behold, one of those with Jesus, having stretched out a hand, drew his sword, and when he struck the bondman of the high priest, he cut off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then Jesus says to him, Return thy sword into its place, for all those who take a sword will die by a sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Or do thou think that I cannot now call my Father, and he will provide to me more than twelve legions of agents?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it is necessary to happen this way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, Did ye come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But all this has come to pass, so that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples fled, having forsook him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And those who seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scholars and the elders were assembled together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">But Peter followed him from afar, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And having entered inside, he sat with the subordinates to see the outcome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Now the chief priests and the elders and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">and they did not find it. And although many false witnesses came, they did not find it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">But finally two false witnesses having come, they said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it by three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And the high priest having stood up, he said to him, Answer thou nothing? What do these testify against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus was silent. And having responded, the high priest said to him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou are the Christ, the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Jesus says to him, Thou have said. Nevertheless I say to you, Henceforth ye will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming in the clouds of the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest tore his garments, saying, He has blasphemed. What further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now ye heard his blasphemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">What does it seem to you? Having answered, they said, He is deserving of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then they spat in his face and struck him with a fist. And some slapped him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">saying, Prophesy to us, thou Christ. Who is he who struck thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and one servant girl came to him, saying, Thou also were with Jesus the Galilean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But he denied before them all, saying, I do not know what thou say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And when he was gone out into the porch, another woman saw him, and says to them there, This man was also with Jesus the Nazarene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">And after a little while those who stood, having approached, said to Peter, Surely thou also are of them, for thy accent even makes thee apparent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then he began to curse vehemently and to swear, I do not know the man. And straightaway a cock sounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">And Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him, Before a cock sounds, thou will deny me thrice. And having gone outside, he wept bitterly.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But having become morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people held consultation against Jesus in order to condemn him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And having bound him, they led him away and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Judas, who betrayed him, after seeing that he was condemned, having repented, he brought back the thirty silver pieces to the chief priests and elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">saying, I sinned, having betrayed innocent blood. But they said, What is it to us? See thou to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And having cast down the silver pieces in the temple, he departed, and after going away, he hanged himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And after taking the silver pieces, the chief priests said, It is not permitted to put them into the treasury, since it is a price of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And having held consultation, they bought the potter's field with them for burial for foreigners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore that field was called the field of blood, to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, which says, And they took the thirty silver pieces, the price of him who was valued, whom they valued from the sons of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned him, saying, Are thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, Thou say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Pilate says to him, Do thou not hear how many things they testify against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he did not answer him, not even one word, so as for the governor to marvel greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now during a feast the governor had been accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wanted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do ye want I should release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he knew that they delivered him up because of envy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, There is nothing for thee and that righteous man. For I suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now the governor having answered, he said to them, Which of the two do ye want I would release to you? And they said, Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate says to them, What then shall I do to Jesus who is called Christ? They all say to him, He should be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the governor said, For what evil has he done? But they cried out even more, saying, He should be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather an uproar was developing, after taking water, he washed his hands in front of the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. See ye to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And having answered, all the people said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus he delivered him so that he would be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus into the Praetorium, gathered the whole band to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And having stripped him, they put a scarlet robe on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And having woven a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And having knelt down before him, they ridiculed him, saying, Hail, king of the Jews!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And having spat upon him, they took the reed and were striking him on his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And after they ridiculed him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away in order to crucify.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And while coming out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They drafted this man, so that he might take his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And having come to a place called Golgotha, that is called, the place of a skull,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall. And having tasted it, he would not drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when they crucified him, they divided his garments, casting a lot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they sat, they keep watch over him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then two robbers are crucified with him, one at the right hand and one at the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and saying, Thou who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save thyself. If thou are the Son of God, come down from the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And likewise also the chief priests, ridiculing with the scholars, and elders, and Pharisees, said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He saved others, he cannot save himself. If he is the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusted in God, let him rescue him now, if he wants him, for he said, I am the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And also the robbers who were crucified with him reviled him the same way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now from the sixth hour darkness developed over all the land until the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a great voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? That is, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And some of those who stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calls Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And straightaway one of them, after running, and having taken a sponge, and having filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But the others said, Leave thou be. We might see if Elijah comes he will save him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus, having cried out again in a great voice, yielded up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks split,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and the sepulchers were opened, and many bodies of the sanctified who have been asleep arose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And having come forth out of the sepulchers after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Now the centurion, and those with him watching over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that happened, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And many women were there watching from afar, who followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And having become evening, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was discipled by Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And a man was in their synagogue with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">saying, Oh no! What is with us and with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Did thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou are, the Holy man of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be thou muzzled, and come out of him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And having seen their faith, Jesus says to the paralyzed man, Child, thy sins are forgiven thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But some of the scholars were sitting there, and deliberating in their hearts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Why does this man speak blasphemies this way. Who can forgive sins but one, God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And straightaway Jesus, having perceived in his spirit that they so deliberated within themselves, said to them, Why do ye deliberate these things in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which is easier, to say to the paralyzed man, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But that ye may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins (he says to the paralyzed man),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go to thy house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And he spoke to his disciples that a small boat would stay by him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And he says to them, Do ye not know this parable? And how will ye understand all the parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The man who sows sows the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And these are those by the path where the word is sown. And whenever they may hear, straightaway Satan comes, and takes away the word that has been sown in their hearts.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">And if thy foot may cause thee to stumble, cut it off. It is good for thee to enter into life crippled, than having thy two feet to be cast into hell, into the unquenchable fire</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">where their worm does not perish, and the fire is not quenched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And if thine eye may cause thee to stumble, pluck it out. It is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God one-eyed, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">where their worm does not perish, and the fire is not quenched.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And unless the Lord cut short the days, no flesh would have been saved, but because of the chosen, whom he chose, he cut short the days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And then if any man should say to you, Lo, here is the Christ, or, Lo, there, do not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will give signs and wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after two days was the Passover and the unleavened bread. And the chief priests and the scholars sought how, having take him with trickery, they might kill him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but they said, Not during the feast, lest there will be an uproar of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat relaxing, a woman came having an alabaster cruse of ointment of pure spikenard, very valuable. And having broken the alabaster cruse, she poured it on his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And some were indignant within themselves, saying, Why has this waste of the ointment happened?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For this could have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and given to the poor. And they grumbled at her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Jesus said, Leave her be. Why do ye cause troubles for her? She performed a good work on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For ye always have the poor with you, and whenever ye may desire ye can do them well, but ye do not always have me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">She applied what she had to anoint my body. She did it beforehand for the burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And truly I say to you, wherever this good news may be preached in the whole world, also what she did will be told for a memorial of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, so that he might betray him to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him silver. And he sought how he might betray him conveniently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the Passover, his disciples say to him, Where do thou want, after going, we should prepare that thou may eat the Passover?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he sends forth two of his disciples, and says to them, Go into the city, and a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And wherever he may enter, say ye to the house-ruler, The teacher says, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he himself will show you a large upper room spread out ready. Prepare ye for us there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found just as he had said to them. And they prepared the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And having become evening he comes with the twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And as they were relaxing and eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, that one of you eating with me will betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, Not I? and another, Not I?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And having answered, he said to them, It is one of the twelve dipping with me in the dish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The Son of man indeed goes as it is written about him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It was good for him if that man was not born.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And after taking the cup, having expressed thanks, he gave to them, and they all drank from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he said to them, This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Truly I say to you, that I will no more drink of the fruit of the grapevine, until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when they sang a hymn, they went out onto the mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Jesus says to them, All ye will be caused to stumble by me this night, because it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But Peter said to him, Even if all will be caused to stumble, yet not I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Jesus says to him, Truly I say to thee, that thou today, in this night, before a cock sounds twice, will deny me thrice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But he spoke more extreme, If I must die with thee, I will, no, not deny thee. And they all spoke the same way also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they come to a place the name of which was Gethsemane. And he says to his disciples, Sit ye here until I pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he takes Peter and James and John with him, and began to be greatly disturbed, and very distressed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he says to them, My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain ye here, and watch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And having gone forward a little, he fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee. Remove this cup from me, but not what I want, but what thou want.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And he comes and finds them sleeping. And he says to Peter, Simon, Do thou sleep? Could thou not watch one hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Watch ye and pray that ye may not enter into temptation. Truly, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And again having departed, he prayed, having said the same statement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And having returned, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were weighed down, and they knew not what they should reply to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he comes the third time, and says to them, Sleep the remaining, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me has come near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And straightaway, while he still spoke, Judas, being one of the twelve, comes, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs from the chief priests, and the scholars, and the elders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I may kiss is he. Seize him, and lead away securely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And when he came, straightaway having approached him, he says, Rabbi, Rabbi, and kissed him much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And they threw their hands on him, and seized him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And a certain one of those who stood by, having drawn his sword, struck the bondman of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And having answered, Jesus said to them, Have ye come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to arrest me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">I was daily near you, teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me-but that the scriptures might be fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And having forsook him, they all fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And a certain one young man followed with him, having been wrapped naked in a linen cloth. And the young men seized him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">but having left behind the linen cloth, he fled from them naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And they led Jesus away to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scholars assemble with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And Peter followed him from a distance, as far as inside the courtyard of the high priest, and was sitting with the subordinates, and warming himself near the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, and did not find it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">For many testified falsely against him, and their testimonies were not consistent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And some men having stood up, testified falsely against him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">We heard him saying, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and by three days I will build another not made with hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And not even this way was their testimony consistent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And the high priest having stood up in the midst, he demanded Jesus, saying, Thou answer nothing? What is it these men testify against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">But he remained silent, and answered nothing. Again the high priest demanded him, and says to him, Are thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And Jesus said, I am. And ye will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">And the high priest having torn his clothes, he says, What further need have we of witnesses?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Ye have heard the blasphemy. What does it seem to you? And they all condemned him to be deserving of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him with a fist, and to say to him, Prophesy. And the subordinates were throwing him with slaps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest comes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">And having seen Peter warming himself, having looked at him, she says, Thou also were with Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">But he denied, saying, I know not, nor understand what thou say. And he went outside onto the porch, and a cock sounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">And the servant girl having seen him, she began again to say to those who stood by, This man is from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But he again denied it. And after a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, Surely thou are from them, for thou are a Galilean, and thy accent is similar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">But he began to curse and to swear, I do not know this man of whom ye speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">And the second time a cock sounded. And Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him, Before a cock sounds twice, thou will deny me thrice. And having broke down, he wept.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And straightaway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scholars and the whole council, having made a plan, after binding Jesus, they took him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And the chief priests accused him of many things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Pilate again questioned him, saying, Thou answer nothing? Behold how many things they testify against thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But Jesus answered nothing any more, so as for Pilate to wonder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now during a feast he released to them one prisoner, whomever they requested.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And a man who was called Barabbas was with the rebels who were bound, men who had committed murder during the insurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And having cried aloud, the multitude began to ask as he was always doing for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Pilate answered them, saying, Do ye wish that I would release to you the king of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up because of envy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the chief priests incited the crowd, so that he would release Barabbas to them instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And again having answered, Pilate said to them, What then do ye wish I would do to the man whom ye call the king of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they cried out again, Crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Pilate said to them, For what evil has he done? But they cried out even more, Crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Pilate, wanting to do what was sufficient for the crowd, released Barabbas to them. And he delivered Jesus, after scourging, so that he might be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the soldiers led him away inside the courtyard, which is the Praetorium, and they call together the whole band.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they put purple clothing on him, and clothe him with a woven crown of thorns,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and began to salute him, Hail, king of the Jews!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshiped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when they had mocked him, they took the purple garment off of him, and dressed him with his own garments. And they lead him out so that they might crucify him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">save thyself, and come down from the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Likewise also the chief priests mocking among each other with the scholars said, He saved others, he cannot save himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe in him. And those who were crucified with him reviled him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And having become the sixth hour, darkness occurred over the whole land until the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a great voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Inasmuch as many have taken in hand to arrange in order a narration about the deeds that have been brought to fullness among us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">just as they delivered them to us, who became from the beginning eyewitnesses and servants of the word,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">it occurred to me also, having followed closely from the beginning all things accurately, to write to thee in order, eminent Theophilus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">so that thou might know the certainty of the declarations about which thou were instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It came to pass in the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest, named Zacharias, from the division of Abijah, and his wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they were both righteous before God, going in all the commandments and righteous things of the Lord blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there was no child to them because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in their days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But it came to pass during his service as a priest in the course of his division in the presence of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">that, according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to burn incense after entering into the temple of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And an agent of the Lord became visible to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Zacharias having seen, was shaken, and fear fell upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the agent said to him, Fear not, Zacharias, because thy plea was heard, and thy wife Elizabeth will bear a son for thee. And thou shall call his name John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there will be joy and exultation for thee, and many will rejoice at his birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he should, no, not drink wine and strong drink. And he will be filled of the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's belly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he will turn back many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he will go ahead, in front of him, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn back the hearts of fathers toward children, and the disobedient in a mentality of the righteous, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Zacharias said to the agent, How will I know this? For I am aged, and my wife is advanced in her days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And having answered, the agent said to him, I am Gabriel who stand in the presence of God. And I was sent to speak to thee, and to announce these good news to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And behold, thou will be mute, and not able to speak until that day these things will come to pass, because thou did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And after these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she concealed herself five months, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thus the Lord has done to me during the days in which he looked, to take away my shame among men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now in the sixth month the agent Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip being tetrarch of the region belonging to Ituraea, and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias being tetrarch of Abilene,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to be in John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching an immersion of repentance for remission of sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, which says, The voice of a man crying out in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be brought low. And the crooked things will be into straight and the rough into smooth ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And all flesh will see the salvation of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be immersed by him, Ye offspring of vipers, who showed you to flee from the coming wrath?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have a father, Abraham. For I say to you, that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And even now the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore not making good fruit is cut down, and cast into fire.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And he said to them, Collect not one thing more than from what has been appointed for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And men who were soldiers also questioned him, saying, And we, what should we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, nor accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And as the people were expectant, and all pondering in their hearts about John, if perhaps he was the Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">John responded, saying to them all, I indeed immerse you in water, but a man mightier than I comes, of whom I am not worthy to unloose the strap of his shoes. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And having answered, Simon said to him, Master, having toiled through the whole night, we took nothing, but at thy saying, I will let down the net.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net was tearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they beckoned to their partners in the other boat, after coming, to assist them. And they came and filled both the boats, so as for them to be sunk down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Simon Peter having seen, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me, because I am a sinful man, Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For astonishment surrounded him, and all those with him, at the catch of the fishes that they caught,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and likewise also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not, from henceforth thou will be catching men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when they brought their boats to land, after forsaking all, they followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it came to pass while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy. And having seen Jesus, having fallen on his face, he besought him, saying, Lord, if thou will, thou can make me clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And having stretched forth his hand, he touched him, having said, I will, be thou clean. And straightaway the leprosy departed from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he commanded him to tell no man, but, After going, show thyself to the priest, and bring concerning thy cleansing, just as Moses commanded for a testimony to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the report about him went through more, and many multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him from their infirmities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But he himself was withdrawing into the desolate regions, and praying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass during one of those days, he was also teaching. And there were seated Pharisees and law teachers, who were men having come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was to heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And behold, men bringing a man on a bed who was paralyzed. And they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And not having found how they might bring him in because of the multitude, after going up upon the housetop, they let him down through the tiles with the small bed into the midst in front of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And having seen their faith, he said to him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the scholars and the Pharisees began to deliberate, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, except God alone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, having responded, he said to them, Why do ye deliberate in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But that ye may know that the Son of man has authority upon earth to forgive sins (he said to the paralyzed man), I say to thee, Arise, and after taking up thy small bed, go to thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And immediately having risen up before them, after taking up that on which he lay, he departed to his house glorifying God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And amazement gripped all, and they glorified God. And they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And after these things he went forth and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And he said to him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And after leaving behind all, having risen up, he followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Levi made a great feast for him in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were relaxing with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And their scholars and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And having answered, Jesus said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those faring badly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make supplications, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he said to them, Ye cannot make the sons of the wedding hall fast while the bridegroom is with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But the days will also come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he also spoke a parable to them. No man puts a patch of a new garment on an old garment, otherwise both the new tears, and that from the new will not blend with the old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And no man puts new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the new wine will burst the wineskins, and will itself be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And no man having drunk old straightaway desires new, for he says, The old is better.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass for him to be going through the grain fields on a particular sabbath, and his disciples were plucking the ears and were eating, rubbing them in their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But some of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye what is not permitted to do on the sabbath day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And having answered them, Jesus said, Have ye not read even this, what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the loaves of the presentation, and also gave to those who were with him, which is not permitted to eat, except the priests alone?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And the scholars and the Pharisees watched if he would heal on the sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And having risen, he stood up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesus said to them, I will question you. What? Is it permitted on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm, to save life, or to kill?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And having looked around on them all, he said to him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did, and his hand was restored whole as the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But they were filled with fury, and deliberated with each other what they might do to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he happened in these days to go out onto the mountain to pray, and he was continuing all night in prayer to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when it became day, he called his disciples, and chose twelve from them, whom he also named apostles:</VERS>

Thou hypocrite, first take out the beam from thine own eye, and then thou will see clearly to take out the speck in thy brother's eye.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And when he completed all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they came to Jesus they urged him earnestly, saying, He is worthy for whom thou may offer this,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for he loves our nation, and he himself built the synagogue for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far distant from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, be not troubled, for I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore neither did I consider myself worthy to come to thee, but speak by word, and my boy will be healed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And the disciples of John informed him about all these things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">This is he about whom it is written, Behold, I send my agent before thy face, who will prepare thy way before thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the others in parables, so that seeing they would not see, and hearing they would not understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now the parable is this. The seed is the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And those by the way are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, lest having believed, they would be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And those on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy. And these have no root, who believe for a time, and withdraw in time of trial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And that which fell in the thorns, these are those who heard, and as they go they are choked by cares and wealth and pleasures of life, and do not bring to maturity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But those in the good ground, these are those who in an good and right heart, having heard the word, hold it firm, and bring forth fruit in perseverance.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And having approached, they awoke him, saying, Master, master, we are perishing. And having risen, he rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it became calm.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">For he commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man, for many times it had seized him. And he was bound with chains and shackles, and guarded. And breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desolate regions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Jesus demanded him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion, because many demons were entered into him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">And when those who tended them saw what happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the fields.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they came out to see what happened. And they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons had gone out, sitting near the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And also those who saw it informed them how the man who was demon-possessed was saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the whole multitude of the region around the Gadarenes besought him to depart from them, because they were gripped by great fear. And he, having embarked into the boat, returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him to be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Return to thy house, and relate everything God did for thee. And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city how many things Jesus did for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And it came to pass during Jesus returning, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And behold, there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. And having fallen down near Jesus' feet, he besought him to come into his house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">because there was with him an only begotten daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But during his going the multitudes thronged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And a woman being with an issue of blood for twelve years, who, although she spent her entire living on physicians, was unable to be healed by any,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">having come from behind, she touched the border of his garment. And immediately the issue of her blood stayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And Jesus said, Who is he who touched me? But when they all denied, Peter and those with him, said, Master, the multitudes come together and crowd thee, and thou say, Who is he who touched me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But Jesus said, Who touched me? For I perceived power having gone forth from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling. And having fallen down before him, she declared to him in the presence of all the people for what reason she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he said to her, Cheer up, Daughter. Thy faith has healed thee. Go in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">While he still spoke, some man comes from the synagogue ruler, saying to him, Thy daughter has died. Do not trouble the teacher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But having heard it, Jesus answered him, saying, Fear not, only believe and she will be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And when he came to the house, he did not allow any man to enter in except Peter and John and James, and the father of the girl and the mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And all were weeping and bewailing her. But he said, Weep not. She did not die, but sleeps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And they ridiculed him, knowing that she died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But having sent them all away outside, having taken her by the hand, he called out, saying, Girl, awake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. And he commanded to give her to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And her parents were amazed, but he ordered them to tell no man that which happened.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And having summoned the twelve, he gave them power and authority over all demons, and to heal diseases.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal those who were incapacitated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said to them, Take nothing for the way, neither staffs, nor bag, nor bread, nor silver, nor have two coats each.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And into whatever house ye may enter, remain there, and from there depart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as many as will not receive you, when departing from that city, also shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And having departed, they passed through the villages, preaching the good news, and healing everywhere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him. And he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John was risen from the dead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and by some that Elijah appeared, and by others that a prophet, one of the ancient men arose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Herod said, I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when the apostles returned, they related to him as many things as they did. And having taken them along, he withdrew in private into a desolate place of a city called Bethsaida.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the multitudes having known, they followed him. And having received them, he spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and he cured those who had need of healing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the day began to decline, and the twelve having come near, they said to him, Send the multitude away, so that, after going into the villages and fields around, they may rest and find provision, because we are here in a desolate place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, There are for us not more than five loaves and two fishes, unless, after going, we might buy food for all this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down in groups of fifty each.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they did so, and made them all sit down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And after taking the five loaves and the two fishes, having looked up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke in pieces, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they ate, and were all filled. And there were taken up to them of the remaining fragments, twelve baskets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And it came to pass, as he was praying privately, the disciples were with him. And he questioned them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And having answered, they said, John the immerser, but others, Elijah, and others, that a certain prophet of the ancient men arose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said to them, But ye, who say ye that I am? And having answered, Peter said, The Christ of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But having chided them, he commanded to tell this to no man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">saying, It is necessary for the Son of man to suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scholars, and be killed, and the third day to rise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said to all, If any man wants to come behind me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever may lose his life because of me, this man will save it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For what is a man benefited, having gained the whole world, but having lost or having forfeited himself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For whoever may be ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of man will be ashamed of this man when he comes in his glory, and of the Father, and of the holy agents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But I tell you truly, there are some of those who stand here, who will, no, not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that after taking Peter and John and James, he went up onto the mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And as he was praying, the appearance of his face became different, and his clothing glistening white.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And behold, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elijah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">who, having appeared in glory, spoke of his departure, which he was going to fulfill at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep, and having become awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And it came to pass, as they were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here, and we could make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah, not knowing what he was saying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And while he was speaking these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them. And they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son. Hear ye him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And at the occurrence of the voice, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and informed no man in those days any of the things that they have seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And it came to pass, on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son, because he is the only begotten to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And lo, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him with foaming. And it departs from him difficultly, injuring him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And I begged thy disciples that they might cast it out, and they could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And having answered, Jesus said, O faithless and perverted generation, how long will I be with you and endure you? Bring thy son here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And as he was still coming, the demon tore him, and he convulsed. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while all were wondering at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Place ye these sayings into your ears, for the Son of man is going to be delivered up into the hands of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, so that they did not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But a thought entered among them, which of them may be greater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">But having perceived the thought of their heart, having taken a child, Jesus stood it beside him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">and he said to them, Whoever may receive this child in my name receives me, and whoever may receive me receives him who sent me, for he who exists smaller among you all, this man will be great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And having answered, John said, Master, we saw a certain man casting out demons in thy name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But Jesus said to him, Do not forbid, for he who is not against us is for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And it came to pass, while fulfilling the days for his ascension, that he also set his face to go to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And he sent agents before his face, and they went. And having gone, they entered into a village of Samaritans, so as to make ready for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And they did not receive him, because his face was going to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And his disciples James and John having seen, they said, Lord, do thou want that we should call fire to come down from the sky, and consume them, as also Elijah did?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But having turned around, he rebuked them, and said, Ye do not know what kind of spirit ye are.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">For the Son of man came not to destroy the lives of men, but to save. And they went to another village.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And it came to pass while they went on the way, a certain man said to him, I will follow thee wherever thou may go, Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky, nests, but the Son of man has not where he might lay his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, allow me first, after departing, to bury my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">But Jesus said to him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but thou, after departing, proclaim the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And also another said, I will follow thee, Lord, but first allow me to bid farewell to those in my house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">But Jesus said to him, No man, having put his hand to a plow, and looking to things behind, is fit for the kingdom of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after these things the Lord also appointed seventy other men, and sent them by twos before his face into every city and place where he himself was going to come.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore, as many things as ye have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed upon the housetops.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I say to you my friends, Be not afraid of those who kill the body, and after these things not having anything more severe to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But I will show you whom ye should fear. Fear him, who, after killing, has power to cast into hell. Yes, I say to you, fear ye him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore, ye are superior to many sparrows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I say to you, every man who will confess in me before men, the Son of man will also confess in him before the agents of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the agents of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And every man who will speak a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him, but to him who blasphemed against the Holy Spirit it will not be forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when they bring you to the synagogues, and the principle positions, and the offices of authority, be not anxious how or what ye should answer in defense, or what ye should say,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">for the Holy Spirit will teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And a certain man out of the crowd said to him, Teacher, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But he said to him, Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbitrator over you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said to them, Watch, and keep away from greed, because to any man, life to him is not in the abundance of things possessed by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The land of a certain rich man brought forth well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he pondered within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have nowhere I will store my crops?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said, I will do this. I will dismantle my barns, and I will build greater, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou have many goods laid up for many years. Take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But God said to him, Thou foolish man, they demand thy soul from thee this night, and the things that thou prepared, whose will they be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So is he who stores up for himself, and is not being rich toward God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said to his disciples, Because of this I say to you, be not anxious for your life, what ye may eat, nor for the body, what ye may wear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the life is more than the food, and the body, the clothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Consider the ravens, because they do not sow, nor do they reap, for which there is no storehouse nor barn, and God feeds them. How much ye are worth more than the birds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his age?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If then ye are not able to do even the least, why are ye anxious about the rest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Consider the lilies, how they grow. They toil not, nor do they spin, and I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And if God so clothes the grass in the field, which today is, and tomorrow being cast into the oven, how much more you, O ye of little faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And do not seek what ye may eat, and what ye may drink, and do not be unsettled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For the nations of the world seek all these things, and your Father knows that ye have need of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">However, seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things will be added to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Fear not, little flock, because your Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Sell things possessed by you, and give charity. Make for yourselves purses not becoming old, a treasure unfailing in the heavens, where no thief approaches, nor moth corrupts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Let your loins be girded about, and the lights burning,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">and be ye like men waiting for their lord, when he may return from the wedding festivities, so that when he comes and knocks, they may straightaway open to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Blessed are those bondmen whom the lord when he comes will find watching. Truly I say to you, that he will gird himself, and will cause them to sit down, and having come, will serve them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And if he should come in the second watch, and should come in the third watch, and find so, blessed are those bondmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But know this, that if the house-ruler had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Therefore, ye also become ready, because the Son of man comes at that hour ye do not suppose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Peter said to him, Lord, did thou speak this parable to us, or also to all?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise manager whom his lord will appoint over his service to give the provision on time?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Blessed is that bondman whom his lord when he comes will find so doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Truly I say to you, that he will appoint him over the things being possessed by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But if that bondman should say in his heart, My lord is late to come, and should begin to beat the servant boys and the servant girls, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">the lord of that bondman will arrive in a day that he does not expect, and in an hour that he is not aware, and will cut him in two, and will place his portion with the unbelieving.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And that bondman who knew his lord's will, and who did not prepare, nor do according to his will, will be beaten much,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">but he who did not know, and did things worthy of blows, will be beaten little. And to every man to whom much was given, much will be required from him. And to whom they entrust much, they will ask him more abundantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">I came to cast fire upon the earth, and what I desire is if it were kindled already.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But I have an immersion to be immersed, and how am I constrained until it will be accomplished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Do ye suppose that I came to give peace on the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">For henceforth there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">A father will be divided against a son, and a son against a father, a mother against a daughter, and a daughter against a mother, a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And he also said to the multitudes, When ye see a cloud rising from the west, straightaway ye say, A shower is coming, and so it happens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And when a south wind is blowing, ye say, There will be heat, and it happens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Ye hypocrites, ye know how to examine the face of the earth and the sky, but how can ye not examine this season?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And also why do ye not judge yourselves what is right?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">For when thou go with thine opponent to the magistrate on the way give effort to be delivered from him, lest he may drag thee to the judge, and the judge may deliver thee to the officer, and the officer would cast thee into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">I say to thee, thou will, no, not come out from there, until thou have paid even the last mite.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now some were present at the same time who informed him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And having answered, Jesus said to them, Do ye suppose that these Galileans became sinful above all the Galileans because they have suffered such things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I tell you, no, but if ye do not repent, ye will all perish similarly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them. Do ye think that these became debtors above all the men who dwell in Jerusalem?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I tell you, no, but if ye do not repent, ye will all likewise perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he spoke this parable. A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said to the vine workman, Behold, three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none. Cut it down, why also waste the ground?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And having answered, he says to him, Sir, allow it this year also until I may dig around it and cast manure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Although surely it should bear fruit, and if not, in the coming year thou will cut it down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years. And she was bent over, and not being able to straighten up completely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when Jesus saw her, he called out, and said to her, Woman, thou are loosed from thine infirmity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he laid his hands upon her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And having responded, the synagogue-ruler, being indignant because Jesus healed on the sabbath, answered and said to the multitude, There are six days in which he ought to work. Therefore coming in these, be healed, and not on the day of the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the Lord therefore answered him and said, Ye hypocrites, does not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his donkey from the stall, and after leading away, give to drink?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has bound, lo, eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And as he said these things all those opposing him were shamed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said, What is the kingdom of God like, and to what will I compare it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It is like a grain of a mustard plant, which having taken, a man cast into his own garden. And it grew and developed into a great tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in the branches if it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And again he said, To what will I compare the kingdom of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">It is like leaven that a woman having taken, hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he went through by cities and villages, teaching, and making a journey toward Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And a certain man said to him, Lord, are they few who are being saved? And he said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Compete to enter in by the narrow gate, because many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">From the time the house-ruler has risen up, and has closed the door, and ye begin to stand outside, and to knock the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us, and having answered, he will say to you, I know not where ye are from,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">then ye will begin to say, We ate and drank in thy presence, and thou taught in our thoroughfares.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he will say, I tell you, I know not where ye are from. Depart from me, all ye workmen of unrighteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when ye will see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you being thrust out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And they will arrive from the east and west, and from the north and south, and will sit down in the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And behold, there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">In the same day some Pharisees came, saying to him, Get thee out and depart from here, because Herod wants to kill thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And he said to them, Having gone, say to this fox, Behold, I cast out demons and finish cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I am fully perfected.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Nevertheless it is necessary for me to go today and tomorrow and the following, because it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her. How often I wanted to gather thy children together as a hen does her brood under her wings, and ye would not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Behold, your house is left to you desolate. And I say to you, that ye will, no, not see me, until it will come when ye say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when he went into the house of a certain man of the chiefs of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And behold, there was a certain man in front of him afflicted with edema.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And having responded, Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it permitted to heal on the sabbath?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But they were silent. And having taken him, he healed him and released him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And having responded, he said to them, Of which of you will a son or an ox fall into a pit, and he will not straightaway lift him out on the day of the sabbath?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they could not answer him back to these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he spoke a parable to those who were invited when he noticed how they chose out the chief places, saying to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When thou are invited by any man to wedding festivities, do not sit down in the chief place, lest there may be a more honorable man than thou who was invited by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he who invited thee and him, having come, will say to thee, Give place to this man, and then thou will begin with embarrassment to take the last place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But when thou are invited, having gone, sit down in the last place, so that when he who has invited thee comes, he will say to thee, Friend, go up higher, then it will be esteem to thee in the presence of those dining with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Because every man who lifts himself up will be made lower, and he who makes himself lower will be lifted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he also said to the man who invited him, When thou make a dinner or a supper, do not call thy friends, nor thy brothers, nor thy kinsmen, nor prosperous neighbors, lest they also invite thee in return, and a recompense be made to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when thou make a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and thou will be blessed, because they do not have to recompense thee, for it will be recompensed to thee at the resurrection of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And a certain man of those dining together having heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he who will eat dinner in the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said to him, A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he sent forth his bondman at the hour of the meal to say to those who were invited, Come, because all things are now ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they all from one began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I have need to go out and see it. I ask thee have me excused.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And another said, I bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to test them. I ask thee have me excused.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And another said, I married a wife, and because of this I cannot come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And that bondman, having come, he informed his lord these things. Then the house-ruler having become angry, he said to his bondman, Go out quickly into the thoroughfares and lanes of the city, and bring here the poor and maimed and crippled and blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the bondman said, Lord, as thou commanded it has happened, and yet there is room.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the lord said to the bondman, Go out into the roads and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For I say to you, that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper. For many are called, but few chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now many multitudes went with him, and having turned, he said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If any man comes to me, and does not regard as inferior his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, and besides his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And whoever does not bear his cross, and come behind me, cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For which of you wanting to build a tower, does not, having first sat down, count the cost whether he has the things for completion?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So that perhaps, having laid its foundation, and not being able to finish, all those who see begin to ridicule him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Or what king going to encounter another king in war, will not, having first sat down, consult whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And if not, while he is still far off, having sent a delegation, he asks the things about peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So therefore every man of you who does not renounce all things being possessed by him, cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">The salt material is good, but if the salt material becomes tasteless, by what will it be seasoned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">It is fit neither for the land nor for manure; they cast it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now all the tax collectors and sinners were approaching him to hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Pharisees and the scholars murmured, saying, This man receives sinners and eats with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he spoke this parable to them, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave behind the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go for that which was lost until he finds it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when he finds it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when he comes to the house, he calls together his men friends and his men neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I say to you, that thus there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous men who have no need of repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she lose one drachma, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she finds it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when she has found it, she calls together her lady friends and lady neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, because I found the drachma that I lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus I say to you, there becomes joy in the presence of the agents of God over one sinner who repents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said, A certain man had two sons,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me. And he divided to them his living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And not many days after, the younger son, having gathered all together, journeyed into a distant country, and there he squandered his wealth living recklessly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he spent all, a mighty famine developed in that country, and he began to be in want.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And having gone, he was joined to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he longed to fill his belly from the husks that the swine ate, and no man gave to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But when he came to himself, he said, How many hired men of my father's have abundance of loaves, but I am perishing with hunger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">After rising, I will go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I am no more worthy to be called thy son. Make me as one of thy hired men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And having risen, he went to his father. But while he was still distant, afar off, his father saw him and felt compassion. And having ran, he fell on his neck, and kissed him much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight. I am no more worthy to be called thy son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the father said to his bondmen, Bring forth the best robe and clothe him, and give a ring for his hand, and shoes for his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having brought the fatted calf, kill it, and having eaten, we will be cheerful,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">because this my son was dead, and became alive again. And he was lost, and is found. And they began to be cheerful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But his elder son was in a field. And while coming, having approached the house, he heard music and dancing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And having summoned one of the boys, he inquired what these things might be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he said to him, Thy brother arrived, and thy father has killed the fatted calf, because he received him back healthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore, his father having come out, he called him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But having answered, he said to his father, Lo, so many years do I serve thee, and I never passed by a commandment of thine, and yet thou never gave me a goat that I might be merry with my friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But when this thy son came, who has devoured thy living with harlots, thou killed for him the fatted calf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he said to him, Child, thou are always with me, and all my things are yours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But it was needful to make merry and be glad, because this thy brother was dead, and became alive again, and was lost, and was found.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he also said to his disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a manager, and this man was accused to him as squandering things possessed by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And having called him, he said to him, What is this I hear about thee? Render the account of thy management, for thou can no longer manage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the manager said within himself, What shall I do because my lord takes away the management from me? I am not able to dig. I am ashamed to beg.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from the management they may receive me into their houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And having summoned each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much do thou owe to my lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said, A hundred measures of olive oil. And he said to him, Receive thy document, and having sat down, quickly write fifty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Next he said to another, And how much do thou owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he says to him, Receive thy document, and write eighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And his lord commended the unrighteous manager because he did shrewdly. Because the sons of this age are shrewder in their own generation than the sons of the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I say to you, make friends for yourselves from the mammon of unrighteousness, so that, when ye cease, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The man faithful in the least is faithful also in much, and the man unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If therefore ye did not become faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you what is true?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And if ye did not become faithful in the alien, who will give thine to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Pharisees, being lovers of money, heard all these things, and they sneered him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said to them, Ye are those who declare yourselves righteous in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. Because what is lofty among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed good news, and every man in it is treated aggressively.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And all who saw murmured, saying, He went in to relax with a sinful man.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And as they heard these things, he spoke, adding on a parable because he was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And having called ten of his bondmen, he gave them ten minas and said to them, Do business until I come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy behind him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass for him to return, having taken the kingdom. And he said for these bondmen to be called to him, to whom he gave the silver, so that he might know what any man gained by trading.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to him, Well, thou good bondman. Because thou became faithful in the least, be thou having authority over ten cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the second came, saying, Lord, thy mina gained five minas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he also said to him, And thou become over five cities.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">And if any man asks you, Why do ye untie it? Thus ye will say to him, The Lord has need of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And having departed, those who were sent found just as he said to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And as they were untying the colt, the masters of it said to them, Why do ye untie the colt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they said, The Lord has need of it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">And as he was now coming near, at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God in a great voice about all the mighty works that they had seen, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And having cast him outside of the vineyard, they killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others. And having heard it, they said, May it not happen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But having looked upon them, he said, What then is this that is written, The stone that those who build rejected, this became the head of the corner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Every man who falls on that stone will be broken, but on whomever it may fall, it will grind him to dust.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">There were therefore seven brothers. And the first having taken a wife, died childless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the second took the woman, and this man died childless.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said, Truly I say to you, that this poor widow cast in more than they all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For all these cast into the offerings of God from their abundance, but this woman from her poverty cast in all the living that she had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as some spoke about the temple, that it was adorned with fine stones and gifts, he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These things that ye see, the days will come during which there will not be left a stone upon a stone that will not be thrown down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they questioned him, saying, Teacher, when therefore will these things be? And what is the sign when these things are going to happen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said, Watch that ye may not be led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, I am, and, The time has come near. Go ye not therefore after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when ye may hear of wars and tumults, do not be alarmed, for these things must first happen, but the end is not straightaway.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then he said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And great earthquakes will be in various places, and famines and plagues. And there will be fearful sights and great signs from the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But before all these things, they will throw their hands on you, and will persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But it will go out from you for testimony.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Settle therefore in your hearts not to premeditate to make defense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For I will give you a mouth and wisdom that all those who oppose you will not be able to contradict or to resist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And ye will be betrayed even by parents, and kinsmen, and friends, and brothers. And some of you they will condemn to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And ye will be hated by all men because of my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And, no, not a hair of your head will perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In your perseverance ye gain your souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But when ye see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that the desolation of it has come near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those in the midst of it depart out, and let not those in the rural areas enter into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Because these are days of vengeance to fulfill all things that are written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But woe to those who have in the womb, and to those who suckle in those days. For there will be great distress upon the land, and wrath to this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they will fall by the jaw of the sword, and will be led away captive into all the nations. And Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, roaring of sea and of tossing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">fainting of men from fear, and of anticipation of the things coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and much glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when these things begin to happen, stand upright, and lift up your heads, because your redemption approaches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he spoke a parable to them. Behold the fig tree, and all the trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When they are now sprouting, ye know seeing for yourselves that summer is now near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Even so ye, when ye see these things happening, know ye that the kingdom of God is near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Truly I say to you, that this generation will, no, not pass away until all things happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words may, no, not pass away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down in debauchery and drunkenness and mundane cares, and that day come upon you sudden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For it will come like a trap upon all those who sit upon the face of all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Watch ye therefore, making supplication at all times, so that ye may be considered worthy to escape all these things going to happen, and to stand before the Son of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And during the days he was teaching in the temple, and going forth the nights, he lodged on the mount that is called Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And all the people rose early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the feast of unleavened bread was coming near, which is called Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the chief priests and the scholars sought how they might kill him, for they feared the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And having departed, he conversed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they were glad, and agreed together to give him silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he consented and sought opportunity to betray him to them apart from the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the day of unleavened bread came during which it was necessary to kill the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he sent Peter and John, saying, After departing, prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they said to him, Where do thou want that we should prepare?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said to them, Behold, having entered into the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house where he enters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And ye shall say to the house-ruler, The teacher says to thee, Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he will show you a large upper room furnished. Prepare there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And having gone, they found just as he said to them, and they prepared the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when the hour came, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before my suffering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For I say to you, that I will eat of it no more, no, not till when it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And having taken a cup, having expressed thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I say to you, that I will, no, not drink from the fruit of the grapevine till when the kingdom of God comes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And after taking bread, having expressed thanks, he broke in pieces, and gave to them, saying, This is my body that is given for you. Do ye this in my memory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Likewise also the cup after dining, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood being shed for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Nevertheless behold, the hand of the man who betrays me is with me on the table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the Son of man indeed goes according to that which has been determined, nevertheless woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they began to question among themselves who then of them would be going do this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And also a dispute develop among them, which of them is considered to be greater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles have dominion over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called Benefactors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But ye are not this way. Rather, the greater among you, shall become as the newer, and he who leads, as he who serves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For who ranks higher, he who sits dining, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits dining? But I am in the midst of you as he who serves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But ye are those who have continued with me in my trials.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And I appoint to you, just as my Father appointed to me a kingdom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you to sift you as wheat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">but I prayed for thee, so that thy faith may not fail. And thou, when thou have returned, strengthen thy brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he said, I say to thee, Peter, a cock will, no, not sound today, before thou will thrice deny that thou know me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he said to them, When I sent you without bag and pouch and shoes, did ye lack anything? And they said, Nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then he said to them, But now, he who has a bag, let him take it, and likewise a pouch. And he who has no sword, let him sell his cloak and buy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For I say to you, that this that is written is still necessary to be completed in me, And he was counted with lawless men, for these things about me also have fulfillment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And having come out, he proceeded according to his habit to the mount of Olives, and his disciples also followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he came at the place, he said to them, Pray ye not to enter into temptation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw. And he knelt down and prayed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">saying, Father, if thou want, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless not my will, but thine be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And an agent from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And having become in agony he prayed more intensely, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling down to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And after rising up from his prayer, having come to the disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And said to them, Why sleep ye? Having risen, pray that ye may not enter into temptation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">While he yet spoke, behold, a multitude, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them. And he came near to Jesus to kiss him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">But Jesus said to him, Judas, thou betray the Son of man with a kiss?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And when those who were around him saw what would be, they said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And a certain one of them struck the bondman of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">But having answered, Jesus said, Allow ye as far as this. And having touched his ear, he healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, who came to him, Have ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">When I was with you daily in the temple, ye did not stretch forth hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And having seized him, they led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed from afar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And having kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and having sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But a certain servant girl having seen him sitting near the light, and having looked intently upon him, she said, This man was also with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">But he denied him, saying, Woman, I do not know him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And after a little while, another man having see him, said, Thou also are from them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And about one hour having passed, some other man insisted, saying, In truth this man was also with him, for he is also a Galilean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And Peter said, Man, I do not know what thou are saying. And immediately, while he still spoke, a cock sounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And having turned, the Lord looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, Before a cock sounds thou will deny me thrice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And having gone outside, Peter wept bitterly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">And the men who held Jesus mocked him, while striking him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">And having covered him, they struck his face, and demanded him, saying, Prophesy! Who is he who struck thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And they spoke many other things against him, railing against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">And when it became day, the eldership of the people, the chief priests, and the scholars, came together, and led him into their council, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">If thou are the Christ, tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">and if I also ask, ye will, no, not answer nor release.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">From henceforth the Son of man will be sitting at the right hand of the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">And they all said, Therefore thou are the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And they said, What further need have we of testimony? For we have heard from his mouth.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And having risen, the whole company of them led him to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be Christ, a king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Pilate questioned him, saying, Are thou the king of the Jews? And having answered him, he said, Thou say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, I find nothing guilty in this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they were emphatic, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, having begun from Galilee as far as here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Pilate heard Galilee, he questioned if the man is a Galilean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he perceived that he is from Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was himself also in Jerusalem in these days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he was wanting of a considerable time to see him, because of hearing many things about him, and he hoped to see some sign happening by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he interrogated him in considerable words, but he answered him nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the chief priests and the scholars had stood, vehemently accusing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Herod having disdained him with his soldiers, and having mocked him, having arraying him in a bright robe, he sent him back to Pilate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And both Pilate and Herod became friends with each other on the same day, for they were formerly being at enmity toward themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Pilate having called together the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">said to them, Ye brought this man to me as turning away the people. And behold, I, having examined him before you, found nothing guilty in this man of what ye accuse against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But not even Herod, for I sent you back to him, and lo, nothing having been done by him is worthy of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore, having scourged I will release him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now he had need to release one man to them at every feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But they cried out all together, saying, Take away this man, and release to us Barabbas</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(a man who was cast into prison because of a certain insurrection that occurred in the city, and for murder).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Again therefore Pilate called out wanting to release Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he said to them a third time, For what evil did this man do? I have found nothing guilty of death in him. I will therefore, having scourged, release him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But they were relentless with loud voices demanding him to be crucified. And their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Pilate decreed their request to happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he released the man who had been cast into prison because of insurrection and murder, whom they asked for, but he delivered Jesus to their will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when they led him away, having taken hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian coming from the countryside, they laid the cross on him to bring behind Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And a great multitude of the people followed him, and also of women who bewailed and lamented him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But having turning to them, Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, instead weep for yourselves and for your children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Because, behold, the days are coming, during which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the bellies that gave no birth, and the breasts that did not suckle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Because if they do these things in the green tree, what will happen in the dry?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And two other men, malefactors, were also led with him to be executed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they came to the place called Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one at the right hand and the other at the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing. And dividing his garments, they cast a lot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the people had stood watching. And also the rulers with them sneered, saying, He saved others. He should save himself, if this is the Christ, the chosen of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the soldiers also mocked him, approaching, and bringing him vinegar,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">and saying, If thou are the king of the Jews, save thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And there was also an inscription over him written in letters, in Greek and Latin and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And one of the malefactors who were hanged railed him, saying, If thou are the Christ, save thyself and us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But the other man having answered, rebuking him, saying, Thou fear not even God, since thou are in the same condemnation?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And we indeed justly, for we receive worthy of what we did, but this man did nothing amiss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou come into thy kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to thee, today thou will be with me in the paradise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And it was about the sixth hour, and darkness occurred over the whole land until the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And the sun was darkened, and the curtain of the temple was torn in the middle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Jesus, having sounded out in a great voice, said, Father, into thy hands I entrust my spirit. And having said these things, he expired.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And when the centurion saw that which happened, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this man was righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And all the multitudes who came together to this scene, watching that which happened, turned back, beating their breasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And all his acquaintances, and the women who accompanied him from Galilee, had stood from afar, seeing these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And behold a man named Joseph, a council member, being a good and righteous man</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">(this man not having consented to their purpose and deed), was from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who also himself awaited the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">This man having gone to Pilate, requested the body of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And having taken it down, he wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher cut in rock, of which no man was yet lain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And the day was Preparation; sabbath was beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And having followed closely, the women who were gathered to him out of Galilee, they saw the sepulcher, and how his body was laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And having returned, they prepared spices and ointments. And they indeed rested on the sabbath according to the commandment.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And on the first day of the week, very early morning, they came to the sepulcher bringing the spices that they prepared, and some women with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And having entered in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass while they were bewildered about this, that behold, two men stood near them in shining apparel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And since they became frightened and bowing down their face to the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He is not here, but was raised. Remember how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day to rise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they remembered his sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And having returned from the sepulcher, they reported all these things to the eleven, and to all the others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And their sayings appeared before them as idle talk, and they disbelieved them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But having risen, Peter ran to the sepulcher. And having stooped down, he sees the linen cloths laying alone. And he departed, wondering to himself at that which happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And behold, two of them were going the same day to a village that was sixty furlongs away from Jerusalem, which name was Emmaus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they conversed with each other about all these things that happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, while they conversed and discussed, that Jesus himself also having approached, went along with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But their eyes were held, not to recognize him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to them, What are these words that ye toss back to each other, while walking and are looking sad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And one, whose name was Cleopas, having answered, said to him, Thou only visit Jerusalem and do not know the things that happened in it during these days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to them, What? And they said to him, The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who became a prophet, a mighty man in work and word before God and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up for condemnation of death, and crucified him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But we hoped that he is the man who is going to redeem Israel. But even with all these things, it brings this third day today from which time these things happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But also some of our women astonished us, having come to be at the sepulcher early morning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And not having found his body, they came, saying also to have seen a vision of agents who say he is alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And some of those with us went to the sepulcher, and found it this way, just as also the women said, but they did not see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said to them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets spoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things about himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they came near to the village where they were going, and he pretended to go further.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And they constrained him, saying, Remain with us, because it is toward evening, and the day has declined. And he went in to remain with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it came to pass during his dining with them, that, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken in pieces he gave to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he became invisible from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they said to each other, Was not our heart burning within us while he spoke to us on the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And having risen up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven gathered together,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">and those who were with them who said, The Lord really was raised, and was seen by Simon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they reported the things on the road, and how he was made known to them during the breaking of the bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they spoke these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and says to them, Peace to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But having been startled, and having become frightened, they presumed to see a spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said to them, Why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as ye see me having.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And having said this, he displayed to them his hands and feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And while they still disbelieved from joy and wondering, he said to them, Have ye anything to eat here?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and from a bees honeycomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And having taken it, he ate before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he said to them, These are the words that I spoke to you while still being with you, that it is necessary for all things that are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms about me to be fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he opened their mind to understand the scriptures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And he said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">and to proclaim in his name repentance and remission of sins for all the nations, having begun from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And ye are witnesses of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you. But stay ye in the city until ye are clothed with power from on high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And he led them outside as far as to Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he blessed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And it came to pass while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was brought up into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And having worshiping him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Truly.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">This man was in the beginning with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All things came to be through him, and apart from him not even one thing came to be that has come to be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">A man came to be who was sent from God, his name was John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">This man came for testimony so that he might testify about the light, so that all might believe through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That man was not the light, but that he might testify about the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He was the true light coming into the world that enlightens every man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was in the world, and the world came to be through him, and the world knew him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came to his own, and his own did not accept him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But as many as did accept him, to them he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">who were begotten, not from blood, nor from a will of flesh, nor from a will of man, but from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">John testified about him, and cried out, saying, This was he of whom I said, He who comes after me came to be before me, because he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And from his fullness we all received, even grace for grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Because the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came to be through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No man has ever seen God. The only begotten Son, being in the bosom of the Father, that man reported him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent forth priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they might ask him, Who are thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he confessed, and did not deny, and confessed, I am not the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, What therefore, are thou Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They said therefore to him, Who are thou, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do thou say about thyself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, I am the voice of a man crying out in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, just as the prophet Isaiah said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And those who were sent were from the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they asked him, and said to him, Why therefore do thou immerse if thou are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered them, saying, I immerse in water, but amidst you stands him whom ye know not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He is the man who comes after me, who has become before me, of whom I am not worthy that I might loosen the strap of his shoe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">These things occurred in Bethany beyond the Jordan where John was immersing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">On the morrow John sees Jesus coming to him, and he says, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This is he about whom I said, After me comes a man who has become before me, because he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And I had not known him, but that he would be made known to Israel. Because of this I came immersing in water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And John testified, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And I had not known him. But he who sent me to immerse in water, he said to me, Upon whomever thou will see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, this is he who immerses in the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Again on the morrow John stood, and two of his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And having looked upon Jesus walking, he says, Behold, the Lamb of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Jesus having turned, and having seen them following, says to them, What seek ye? And they said to him, Rabbi (which says, being interpreted, Teacher), where do thou dwell?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He says to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and remained with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard from John and who followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">This man first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he brought him to Jesus. And having seen him, Jesus said, Thou are Simon the son of Jonah. Thou will be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">On the morrow he wanted to go forth into Galilee, and he finds Philip. And Jesus says to him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets wrote: Jesus the son of Joseph of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Nathanael said to him, What good can be from Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says about him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael says to him, How do thou know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, being under the fig tree, I saw thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael answered, and says to him, Rabbi, thou are the Son of God. Thou are the king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, thou believe? Thou will see greater than these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And he says to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, henceforth ye will see the heaven opened, and the agents of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the third day a wedding occurred in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the wedding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And having lacked wine the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jesus says to her, What is with me and with thee, woman? My hour is not yet here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">His mother says to the helpers, Whatever he may say to you, do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now there were six stone water pots laying there in accordance with the purification of the Jews, containing two or three measures each.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus says to them, Fill the water pots with water. And they filled them until over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he says to them, Draw out now, and carry to the feast-ruler. And they carried.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when the feast-ruler tasted the water that became wine, and had not known from where it was (but the helpers who drew the water had known), the feast-ruler called the bridegroom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and says to him, Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they drank much, then the lesser. Thou have kept the good wine until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This is the beginning of the signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and he manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples. And they remained there not many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he found sitting in the temple those who sell oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And having made a whip from cords, he drove all out from the temple, both the sheep and the oxen. And he poured out the coins of the moneychangers, and turned over their tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said to those who sell the doves, Take these things from here. Make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And his disciples remembered that it is written, Zeal for thy house will consume me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Jews therefore answered, and said to him, What sign do thou show us since thou do these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The Jews therefore said, This temple was forty-six years being built, and will thou raise it up in three days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But that man spoke about the temple of his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When therefore he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he spoke this, and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast, many believed in his name seeing his signs that he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and because he had no need that any man should testify about man, for he himself knew what was in man.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">This man came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou have come a teacher from God, for no man can do these signs that thou do if God is not with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to thee, If any man is not begotten from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be begotten, being old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's belly, and be born?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to thee, If any man is not begotten from water and Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That which is begotten from the flesh is flesh, and that which is begotten from the Spirit is spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Marvel not that I said to thee, ye must be begotten from above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The wind blows where it will, and thou hear the sound of it, but know not from where it comes, and where it goes. So is every man who is begotten from the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things happen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered and said to him, Thou are the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Truly, truly, I say to thee, we speak that which we know, and testify of what we have seen, and ye do not accept our testimony.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If I told you earthly things, and ye do not believe, how will ye believe if I should tell you heavenly things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And no man has ascended into heaven, except he who came down out of heaven: the Son of man who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">so that every man who believes in him would not perish, but may have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, so that every man who believes in him would not perish, but have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For God sent the Son into the world not that he might condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He who believes in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their deeds were evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For every man who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, so that his works may not be exposed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he who does the truth comes to the light, so that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the Judean country. And he remained there with them and immersed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And John also was immersing in Aenon near Salim because there was much water there. And they came and were immersed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For John was not yet cast into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore a debate developed from John's disciples with the Jews about purification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, about whom thou have testified, behold, this man immerses, and all men come to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Ye yourselves testify that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent ahead of that man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom's voice. This therefore my joy is fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">It is necessary for that man to increase, but me to decrease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He who comes from above is above all things. He who is of the earth is of the earth, and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And what he has seen and heard, of this he testifies, and no man receives his testimony.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He who has received his testimony has set a seal that God is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For he whom God sent speaks the sayings of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He who believes in the Son has eternal life, but he who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and immersing more disciples than John</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(although Jesus himself did not immerse, but his disciples),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">he left Judea, and departed into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he comes to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the place that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied from the journey, thus was sitting on the well. It was about the sixth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">A woman of Samaria comes to draw water. Jesus says to her, Give me to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For his disciples had gone away into the city so that they might buy food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How do thou, being Jewish, ask to drink from me, being a Samaritan woman, for Jews do not associate with Samaritans?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered and said to her, If thou had known the gift of God, and who it is who says to thee, Give me to drink, thou would have asked him, and he would have given thee living water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The woman says to him, Sir, thou have not even a container, and the well is deep. From where then have thou the living water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Are thou greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his livestock?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered and said to her, Every man who drinks of this water will thirst again,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will, no, not thirst into the age. But the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The woman says to him, Give me this water, sir, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The woman answered and said to him, I have no husband. Jesus says to her, Thou said correctly, I have no husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For thou have had five husbands, and he whom thou now have is not thy husband. This thou have said true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The woman says to him, Sir, I perceive that thou are a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, that the hour is coming when neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem will ye worship the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Ye worship what ye do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But an hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for also the Father seeks such kind who worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God is Spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The woman says to him, I know that Messiah comes, he who is called Christ. When that man comes he will declare all things to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus says to her, I who speak to thee am the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And upon this his disciples came. And they marveled that he spoke with the woman, yet no man said, What seek thou? or, Why do thou speak with her?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The woman therefore left her water pot, and departed into the city, and says to the men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Come, see a man who told me all, as many things as I did. Is not this the Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They went out of the city, and came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">In the meanwhile the disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But he said to them, I have food to eat that ye know not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The disciples therefore said to each other, Did any man bring him to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus says to them, My food is that I do the will of him who sent me, and may finish his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Do ye not say, There are still four months and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and see the fields, that they are already white for harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he who reaps receives a wage and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For in this the saying is true, One is who sows, and another who reaps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">I sent you to reap what ye have not labored. Others have labored, and ye have entered into their labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all, as many things as I did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So when the Samaritans came to him they asked him to remain with them, and he remained there two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And many more believed because of his word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they said to the woman, We no longer believe because of thy speaking, for we have heard ourselves, and know that this really is the Savior of the world, the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And after the two days he departed from there and went into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own fatherland.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Jesus therefore came again to Cana of Galilee where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">This man having heard that Jesus comes out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was going to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Jesus therefore said to him, Unless ye may see signs and wonders, ye will, no, not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The nobleman says to him, Sir, come down before my child dies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus says to him, Go, thy son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus said to him, and he departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And as he was now going down, his bondmen met him and reported, saying, Thy boy lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">So he inquired of them the hour in which he fared well. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son lives. And he himself believed and his whole house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">This again is a second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now there is in Jerusalem by the place pertaining to sheep, a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In these lay a great multitude of those who are feeble, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the movement of the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For an agent went down at a certain time into the pool, and agitated the water. Therefore the first man who stepped in after the agitation of the water became well from whatever affliction he had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And a certain man was there who was thirty-eight years in the weakness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus saw this man lying down, and knew that he fares now a long time, he says to him, Do thou desire to become well?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The infirmed man answered him, Sir, I have no man so that when the water is agitated he might put me into the pool, but while I am coming another steps down before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy bed and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And straightaway the man became well, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was sabbath on that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Jews therefore said to the man who was cured, It is sabbath. It is not permitted for thee to take up the bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, The man who made me well, that man said to me, Take up thy bed and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore they asked him, Who is the man who said to thee, Take up thy bed and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the man who was healed had not known who he is, for Jesus withdrew, a multitude being in the place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou have become well. Sin no more, lest something worse may happen to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The man departed and reported to the Jews that Jesus is the man who made him well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And because of this the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on a sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now and I work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Because of this therefore the Jews sought even more to kill him, because not only did he relax the sabbath, but also he called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, except what he sees the Father doing. For whatever he may do, the Son also does these things in like manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. And he will show him works greater than these, so that ye may marvel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For as the Father raises up the dead and makes alive, so also the Son makes alive whom he will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For neither does the Father judge any man, but he has given all judgment to the Son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">so that all would honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. The man not honoring the Son, does not honor the Father who sent him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Truly, truly, I say to you, that he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life. And he does not come into condemnation, but has passed from death into life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Truly, truly, I say to you, that an hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For as the Father has life in himself, so also he gave to the Son to have life in himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he also gave him authority to execute judgment because he is a son of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Marvel not at this, because an hour comes in which all those in the sepulchers will hear his voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and will come forth, those who have done right to a resurrection of life, and those who have practiced wrong to a resurrection of judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I can from myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge. And my judgment is righteous because I seek not my will, but the will of the Father who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony that he testifies about me is valid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Ye have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But I do not take the testimony from man. However, I say these things, so that ye may be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">That man was the lamp that burns and shines, and ye were willing to rejoice for an hour in his light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But I have testimony greater than of John, for the works that the Father has given me so that I might complete them, the same works that I do, they testify about me that the Father has sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the Father, he who sent me, has testified about me.Ye have neither heard his voice, nor have ever seen his appearance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And ye have not his word dwelling in you, because ye do not believe that man whom he sent for this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Ye search the scriptures, because ye think to have eternal life in them, and those are testifying about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And ye will not come to me, so that ye may have life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">I do not receive glory from men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But I know you, that ye have not the love of God within yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">I have come in my Father's name, and ye do not accept me. If another man should come in his own name, ye will accept that man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">How can ye believe, who receive glory from each other, and seek not the glory from the only God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Think not that I will accuse you to the Father. The man who accuses you is Moses, in whom ye have hoped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For if ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for that man wrote about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">But if ye believe not the writings of that man, how will ye believe my sayings?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Jesus went to the other side of the sea of Galilee of Tiberias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And a great multitude followed him because they saw his signs, which he did on those who are infirmed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jesus went up onto the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus therefore having lifted up his eyes, and having seen that a great multitude comes to him, he says to Philip, From where will we buy loaves, so that these may eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he said this testing him, for he himself knew what he was going to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Philip answered him, Loaves of two hundred denarii of bread are not sufficient for them, so that each of them may take a little something.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There is one child here that has five barley loaves and two fishes, but what are these for so many?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jesus took the loaves, and having expressed thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down, likewise also of the fishes as much as they wanted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain over, so that not anything may be lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets of fragments from the five barley loaves that remained over from those who have eaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When therefore the men saw what sign Jesus did, they said, This really is the prophet who comes into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus therefore having perceived that they are going to come and seize him, so that they might make him king, departed onto the mountain himself alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when it became evening his disciples went down to the sea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and having entered into the boat, they were going to the other side of the sea toward Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not come to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the sea was being raised by a great wind blowing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore having impelled forward about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and coming near to the boat, and they were afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But he says to them, It is I, fear not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat, and straightaway the boat came to be at the land to which they were going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other boat there except that one in which his disciples entered, and that Jesus did not go with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples went away alone,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and other boats came from Tiberias near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord expressed thanks,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they entered into the boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when did thou become here?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, ye seek me not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Work not for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you, for God the Father put a seal on this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They said to him therefore, What shall we do that we may work the works of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus answered, and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe in that man whom he has sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They said to him therefore, What sign do thou, that we may see and believe in thee? What do thou work?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For the bread of God is he who comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They said to him therefore, Lord, always give us this bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will, no, not hunger, and he who believes in me will, no, not ever thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But also I said to you, that ye have seen me, and yet do not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">All that the Father gives me will come to me, and he who comes to me I will, no, not cast out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Because I have come down from heaven, not so that I might do my will, but the will of him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And this is the will of the Father who sent me, that of all that he has given me I would not lose from it, but I will raise it up at the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And this is the will of him who sent me, that every man who sees the Son, and believes in him, may have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Jews therefore murmured about him because he said, I am the bread that came down out of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they said, Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? Therefore how does this man say, I have come down out of heaven?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among each other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">No man can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">It is written in the prophets, And they will all be taught of God. Every man who hears from the Father, and having learned, comes to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God. This man has seen the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me has eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">I am the bread of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="51">I am the living bread, having come down out of heaven. If any man eats of this bread, he will live into the age. And also, the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The Jews therefore contended with each other, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me, and I in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, also he who eats me, that man will also live because of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">This is the bread that came down out of heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died. He who eats this bread will live into the age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">He said these things in a synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Therefore many of his disciples having heard, said, This is a hard saying. Who can listen to it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples are grumbling about this, said to them, Does this cause you to stumble?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Then if ye should see the Son of man ascending where he was before?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">It is the spirit that makes alive. The flesh benefits nothing. The sayings that I speak to you are spirit, are life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Nevertheless, there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus had known from the beginning who they are who do not believe, and who he is who will betray him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">And he said, Because of this I have said to you that no man is able to come to me, if it is not given to him from my Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">From this, many of his disciples went back at these things, and walked no more with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Jesus said therefore to the twelve, Do ye not also want to go?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">Simon Peter therefore answered him, Lord, to whom will we go? Thou have sayings of eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">And we have believed and know that thou are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">But he spoke of Judas Iscariot son of Simon. For this man, being one of the twelve, was going to betray him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he did not want to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His brothers therefore said to him, Depart from here, and go into Judea so that thy disciples also may see thy works that thou do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For no man does anything in secret, and he himself seeks to be in public. If thou do these things, show thyself to the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For not even his brothers believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus therefore says to them, My time is not yet here, but your time is always ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it, that its works are evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Go ye up to this feast. I am not yet going to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And having said these things to them, he remained in Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But when his brothers went up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but as in private.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is that man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And there was much murmuring among the multitudes about him. Some said, He is a good man, others said, No, but he leads the multitude astray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yet no man spoke openly about him because of fear of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when it was now in the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How does this man know scholarly material, not having learned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus therefore answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If any man wants to do his will, he will know about the doctrine, whether it is from God, or I speak from myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him, this man is true, and unrighteousness is not in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Did not Moses give you the law, and none of you does the law? Why do ye seek to kill me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The multitude answered and said, Thou have a demon. Who seeks to kill thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because of this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and ye circumcise a man on a sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If a man receives circumcision on a sabbath, so that the law of Moses may not be loosed, are ye angry with me because I made a man entirely well on a sabbath?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore some of the Jerusalemites said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And lo, he speaks in public, and they say nothing to him. Perhaps the rulers really know that this really is the Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">However we know this man, where he is from, but when the Christ comes, no man knows where he is from.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know where I am from? And I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom ye know not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They sought therefore to seize him, and yet no man laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But many from the crowd believed in him, and they said, When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than these that this man did?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent subordinates so that they might take him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Jesus therefore said, Yet a little time I am with you, and then I go to him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Ye will seek me, and will not find me, and where I am, ye cannot come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The Jews therefore said among themselves, Where is this man going to go that we will not find him? Is he going to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">What is this word that he said, Ye will seek me, and will not find me, and, Where I am, ye cannot come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus had stood and cried out, saying, If any man thirsts, let him come to me and drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He who believes in me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly will flow rivers of living water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But he spoke this about the Spirit that those who believe in him were going to receive, for the Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Many from the multitude therefore, when they heard the saying, said, This is truly the prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Others said, This is the Christ. Others said, For does the Christ come out of Galilee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">So there became a division among the multitude because of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And some of them wanted to take him, but no man laid hands on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The subordinates therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And those men said to them, Why did ye not bring him?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But Jesus went to the mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And at early morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. And having sat down, he taught them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the scholars and the Pharisees bring to him a woman taken in adultery. And having stood her in the midst,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">tempting, they say to him, Teacher, we found this woman committing adultery, in the act.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now in the law, Moses commanded us such women are to be stoned. What therefore do thou say about her?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But they said this, trying him, so that they might have an accusation against him. But Jesus having stooped down, wrote on the ground with his finger, not pretending.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when they continued asking him, after standing erect, he said to them, Let the innocent man of you first cast the stone at her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And again having stooped down, he wrote on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they, having heard and being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, having begun from the elder until the last. And Jesus was left behind alone, and the woman being in the midst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jesus, after standing erect, and having seen no man but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those accusers of thee? Did no man condemn thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee. Go, and henceforth sin no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world. He who follows me would, no, not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou testify about thyself. Thy testimony is not valid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I might testify about myself, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I go, but ye do not know where I come from and where I go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Ye judge according to the flesh. I judge no man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But even if I judge, my judgment is valid, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And also it is written in your law that the testimony of two men is valid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I am he who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They said therefore to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father. If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus spoke these sayings in the treasury as he taught in the temple, and no man seized him, because his hour had not yet come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus therefore again said to them, I go, and ye will seek me, and ye will die in your sin. Where I go, ye cannot come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, because he says, Where I go, ye cannot come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said to them, Ye are from below, I am from above. Ye are of this world, I am not of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I said therefore to you that ye will die in your sins. For unless ye believe that I am he, ye will die in your sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They said therefore to him, Who are thou? And Jesus said to them, The beginning, something that I am even telling you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I have many things to say and to judge about you. But he who sent me is true, and I speak to the world these things that I heard from him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">Jesus therefore said to them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then ye will know that I am he, and I do nothing from myself, but I speak these things as my Father taught me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, because I always do things pleasing to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">As he spoke these things of him, many believed in him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, that every man who does the sin is a bondman of the sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the bondman does not remain in the house into the age. The Son remains into the age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">If therefore the Son should make you free, ye will truly be free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">I know that ye are Abraham's seed, yet ye seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">I speak what I have seen from my Father, and ye therefore do what ye have seen from your father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus says to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But now ye seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Ye do the works of your father. They said therefore to him, We were not begotten from fornication. We have one Father, God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Therefore Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, ye would love me, for I came forth and have come from God. For, neither have I come for myself, but he sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Why do ye not understand my speech? Because ye cannot hear my word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Ye are from the father, the devil, and ye want to do the desires of your father. He was a man-killer from the beginning, and he has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own, because he is a liar, and the father of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And I, because I speak the truth, ye do not believe me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Which of you convicts me about sin? And if I speak truth, why do ye not believe me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">He who is of God hears the sayings of God. Because of this ye do not hear, because ye are not of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Therefore the Jews answered and said to him, Do we not say well that thou are a Samaritan, and have a demon?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Jesus answered, I have no demon, but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But I seek not my own glory. He is who seeks and judges.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Truly, truly, I say to you, if any man keeps my word, he will, no, not see death, into the age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The Jews therefore said to him, Now we know that thou have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets, and thou say, If any man keeps my word, he will, no, not taste of death, into the age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Are thou greater than our father Abraham who died? And the prophets died. Who do thou make thyself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. My Father is he who glorifies me, of whom ye say, He is our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And ye do not know him, but I know him. And if I should say that I do not know him, I will be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Your father Abraham rejoiced that he could see my day, and he saw it, and was glad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">The Jews therefore said to him, Thou have not yet fifty years, and thou have seen Abraham?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham came to be, I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Therefore they took up stones so that they might throw at him, but Jesus was hid, and went out of the temple, having passed through the midst of them, and thus passed on.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And as he passed on, he saw a man blind from birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered, Neither this man sinned, nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day. Night comes when no man can work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Having said these things, he spat toward the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and rubbed the clay on the eyes of the blind man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is translated, He who has been sent). Therefore he went and washed, and came seeing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The neighbors therefore and those who saw him formerly, that he was blind, said, Is this not he who sits and begs?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Others said, He is this man, but others said, He is like him. That man said, I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They said to him therefore, How were thine eyes opened?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">That man answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay, and rubbed on my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. And after going and washing, I received sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore they said to him, Where is that man? He says, I do not know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They brought him to the Pharisees-the former blind man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received sight. And he said to them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he does not keep the sabbath. Other men said, How is a sinful man able to do such signs? And there was division among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They say again to the blind man, What do thou say about him, that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Jews therefore did not believe about him, that he had been blind, and had received sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom ye say that he was born blind? How then does he now see?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And his parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but how he now sees, we know not. Or who opened his eyes, we know not. He has maturity, ask him. He will speak for himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">His parents spoke these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man confessed him as Christ, he should become excommunicated from the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Because of this his parents said, He has maturity, ask him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So they called the man who was blind, for a second time, and said to him, Give glory to God. We know that this man is sinful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">That man therefore answered and said, If he is sinful, I know not. One thing I know, that being blind, now I see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But again they said to him, What did he do to thee? How did he open thine eyes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He answered them, I told you already, and ye did not listen. Why do ye want to hear it again? Do ye not also want to become his disciples?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They reviled him, and said, Thou are a disciple of that man, but we are disciples of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">We know that God has spoken to Moses, but this man, we know not where he is from.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The man answered and said to them, For in this it is amazing, that ye know not where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And we know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any man is a worshiper of God, and does his will, he listens to this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">From the age, it was not heard that any man opened the eyes of a man who was born blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They answered and said to him, Thou were born entirely in sins, and thou teach us? And they cast him outside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus heard that they cast him outside. And having found him, he said to him, Do thou believe in the Son of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">That man answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Jesus said to him, Thou have both seen him, and he is that man who speaks with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he affirmed, Lord, I believe. And he worshiped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Jesus said, For judgment I came into this world, so that those not seeing might see, and those who see might become blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, Are we also blind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus said to them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin, but now ye say, We see, therefore your sin remains.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter in by the door into the fold of the sheep, but goes up some other way, that man is a thief and a robber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But he who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The gatekeeper opens to this man. And the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them. And the sheep follow him because they know his voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they will, no, not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not recognize the voice of strangers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesus spoke this allegory to them, but those men did not understand what it was that he spoke to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus therefore said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, that I am the door of the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All, as many as came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I am the door. If any man enters in by me, he will be saved, and will come in and go out, and will find pasture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The thief comes not, except that he might steal and kill and destroy. I came so that they might have life, and have it more abundantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the hired man, and not being the shepherd, whose sheep are not his own, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees. And the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the hireling flees because he is a hireling, and it is no care to him about the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am the good shepherd, and I know mine, and I am known by mine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Just as the Father knows me, I also know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring those also, and they will hear my voice. And there will become one flock, one shepherd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Because of this the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, so that I may take it again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No man takes it from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore again there became a division among the Jews because of these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And many of them said, He has a demon, and is mad. Why do ye listen to him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Others said, These are not the sayings of a man possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the feast of the dedication happened at Jerusalem, and it was winter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Jews therefore surrounded him, and said to him, When do thou lift up our soul? If thou are the Christ, tell us plainly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye did not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, these testify about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And I give them eternal life, and they will, no, not perish into the age, and not any will snatch them out of my hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">My Father who has given to me, is greater than all, and not one is able to snatch out of my Father's hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I and the Father are one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore again the Jews took up stones so that they might stone him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from my Father. Because of them, which work do ye stone me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The Jews answered him, saying, We stone thee not about a good work, but about blasphemy, and because thou, being a man, make thyself God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">If he designated those men gods, for whom the word of God came to be (and the scripture cannot be broken),</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">Therefore they sought again to take him, and he went forth out of their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he departed again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was first immersing, and he stayed there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And many came to him, and they said, John indeed did not one sign, but all, as many things as John spoke about this man, were true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And many believed in him there.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now a certain Lazarus, from Bethany of the village of Mary and her sister Martha, was sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Mary was the woman who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou love is sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when Jesus heard, he said, This sickness is not about death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore he heard that he is sick, then he actually remained two days in that place he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Later after this he says to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The disciples say to him, Rabbi, the Jews were now seeking to stone thee, and thou go there again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if any man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He spoke these things, and after this he says to them, Our friend Lazarus has become asleep, but I go that I may awake him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">His disciples therefore said, Lord, if he has become asleep, he will be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Jesus had spoken about his death, but those men thought that he was speaking about the restfulness of sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore Jesus then said to them plainly, Lazarus died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that ye may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore Thomas, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So when Jesus came, he found him already four days being kept in the sepulcher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs away from it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and many of the Jews had come to the women, about Martha and Mary, so that they might console them about their brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, met him, but Mary was sitting in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Martha therefore said to Jesus, Lord, if thou were here, my brother would not have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But I know even now that as many things as thou may ask of God, God will give to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus says to her, Thy brother will rise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Martha says to him, I know that he will rise in the resurrection at the last day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, even though he died, he will live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And every man who lives and believes in me will, no, not die, into the age. Do thou believe this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">She says to him, Yes, Lord, I have believed that thou are the Christ, the Son of God who comes into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when she said these things, she departed and called Mary her sister privately, saying, The teacher is here and calls thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When that woman heard, she rises quickly, and comes to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">(Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews therefore being with her in the house and consoling her, having seen Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying that she was going to the sepulcher that she may weep there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Therefore when Mary came where Jesus was, after seeing him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou were here, my brother would not have died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews who gathered with her, weeping, he groaned in the spirit, and was himself troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he said, Where have ye laid him? They said to him, Lord, come and see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But some of them said, This man who opened the eyes of the blind man, was he not also able to cause that this man also would not die?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the sepulcher. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus says, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of the man who came to end, says to him, Lord, he smells now, for it is the fourth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus says to her, Did I not to say thee, that if thou believed, thou will see the glory of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">So they took away the stone where the man who died was laying. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heard me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And I had known that thou always hear me, but because of the multitude that stands by I spoke, so that they may believe that thou sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And having said these things, he cried out with a great voice, Lazarus, come out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the man who died came forth, wrapped hands and feet with grave-clothes, and his face had been wrapped around with a face cloth. Jesus says to them, Loose him, and allow him to go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and who saw what Jesus did, believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What are we doing? Because this man does many signs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">If we allow him this way, all men will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and the nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing at all,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">nor do ye consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not the whole nation should perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Now he said this not from himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And not for the nation only, but also that he might gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So from that day they consulted together so that they might kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the region near the wilderness into a city called Ephraim, and he stayed there with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the countryside before the Passover, so that they might purify themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Therefore they sought Jesus, and spoke with each other as they stood in the temple, What does it seem to you? That he will, no, not come to the feast?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Now also the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that if any man knew where he is, he should disclose it, so that they might take him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, the man who died whom he raised from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So they made a supper for him there, and Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those who sat dining with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Mary therefore, after taking a pound of ointment of very costly genuine spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled of the aroma of the ointment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, the man who was going to betray him, says,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now he said this, not because it was a concern to him about the poor, but because he was a thief, and he had the purse and removed things that were put in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus therefore said, Let her alone. She has keep it for the day of my burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For ye always have the poor with you, but ye do not always have me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore a great multitude of the Jews knew that he is there. And they came, not only because of Jesus, but that they might also see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the chief priests decided that they should kill Lazarus also,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">since because of him many of the Jews were going and were believing in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">On the morrow a great multitude having come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it, as it is written,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Fear not, daughter of Zion. Behold, thy King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now his disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these were things written because of him, and they did these things to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore the multitude, the one that was with him when he called Lazarus from the sepulcher, and raised him from the dead, testified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Also because of this the multitude met him, because they heard of him doing this sign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Do ye see that ye accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now some Greeks were from those who came up so that they might worship at the feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">These men therefore came to Philip, the man from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Philip comes and tells Andrew, and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus answered them saying, The hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After speaking these things, Jesus went forth with his disciples on the other side of the brook Kidron, where there was a garden into which he entered, he and his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now Judas, the man betraying him, had also known the place, because Jesus also often gathered there with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Judas therefore having received the band and subordinates from the chief priests and the Pharisees, comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus therefore knowing all the things that were coming upon him, after going forth, he says to them, Whom seek ye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They answered him, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus says to them, I am he. And Judas, the man betraying him had also stood with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore he said to them, I am he, they went backward and fell to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Again therefore he questioned them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus answered, I told you that I am. If therefore ye seek me, allow these men to go,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">so that the word that he spoke might be fulfilled, Of whom thou have given me, I lost, no, not one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's bondman, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant's name was Malchus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath. The cup that the Father has given me, shall I, no, not drink it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the band, and the chief captain, and the subordinates of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and led him away first to Annas. For he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now Caiaphas was the man who counseled the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Simon Peter followed Jesus, also the other disciple. But that disciple was known to the high priest, and he went in with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Peter had stood near the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought in Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore the servant girl (the doorkeeper) says to Peter, Are thou not also of this man's disciples? That man says, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the bondmen and the subordinates had stood, having made a fire of coals because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. And Peter was also standing with them warming himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his doctrine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered him, I spoke in public to the world. I always taught in a synagogue, and in the temple where the Jews always gather together, and I spoke nothing in secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Why question thou me? Question those who have heard what I said to them. Behold, these know the things that I said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he said these things, one of the subordinates standing by gave a slap to Jesus, saying, Answer thou the high priest this way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus answered him, If I spoke wrongly, testify about the wrong, but if correctly, why strike me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Therefore they said to him, Are thou not also of his disciples? That man therefore denied, and said, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">One of the bondmen of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, says, Did I not see thee in the garden with him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Peter therefore denied again, and straightaway a cock sounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. And it was early, and they did not enter into the Praetorium, so that they would not be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, What accusation do ye bring against this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They answered and said to him, If this man were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered him up to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Pilate therefore said to them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not permitted for us to kill any man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">so that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled that he spoke, signifying what kind of death he was going to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Pilate therefore again entered into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are thou the king of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered, Do thou say this of thyself, or did others tell thee about me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee to me. What have thou done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my subordinates would have fought so that I would not be delivered to the Jews, but now my kingdom is not from here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Pilate therefore said to him, Then thou are a king? Jesus answered, Thou say that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I would testify to the truth. Every man who is of the truth hears my voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this, he went out again to the Jews, and says to them, I find not one cause in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But there is a custom for you that I should release to you one man at the Passover. Do ye wish therefore I would release to you the king of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They all cried out again therefore, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. But Barabbas was a robber.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore Pilate then took Jesus and scourged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the soldiers having woven a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and put around him a purple garment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they said, Hail, king of the Jews! And they gave him slaps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore Pilate again went forth outside, and says to them, Behold, I bring him out to you, so that ye may know that I find not one cause in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus therefore came outside, wearing the thorny crown and the purple robe. And he says to them, Look at the man!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore the chief priests and the subordinates saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify, crucify him! Pilate says to them, Ye take him and crucify, for I find no cause in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Pilate therefore heard this word, he was more afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he went into the Praetorium again, and says to Jesus, Where are thou from? But Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Pilate therefore says to him, Thou do not speak to me? Know thou not that I have authority to crucify thee, and I have authority to release thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered him, Thou would have no authority against me, unless it were given thee from above. Because of this he who delivered me to thee has greater sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">From this Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou are not Caesar's friend. Every man who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Pilate therefore heard this word, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it was the Preparation of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he says to the Jews, Look at your king!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But they cried out, Away, away, crucify him! Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king except Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore he then delivered him to them, so that he might be crucified, and they took and led Jesus away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he went out bearing his cross to a place called, of a Skull, a place that is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">where they crucified him, and two others with him, on this side and that, and Jesus in the middle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And it was written, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, in Latin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, The king of the Jews, but, That man said I am king of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The soldiers therefore when they crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. But the tunic was a seamless weave, from the top throughout.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They said therefore among themselves, Let us not divide it, but cast a lot for it, whose it will be, so that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast a lot. Therefore the soldiers indeed did these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene had stood near the cross of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing by, he says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he says to the disciple, Behold, thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After this, Jesus, having seen that all things are now completed, so that the scripture might be fully complete, says, I thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore a vessel full of vinegar was set there. And having filled a sponge with the vinegar, and having put it around a hyssop, they brought it to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When therefore Jesus received the vinegar, he said, It is finished, and after bowing his head, he gave up the spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews therefore, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the sabbath, since it was Preparation (for it was the high day of that sabbath), they besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and they might be removed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The soldiers therefore came, and indeed broke the legs of the first, and of the other man who was crucified with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But having come to Jesus, when they saw him now having died, they did not break his legs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and straightaway blood and water came out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. And that man knows that he speaks true, so that ye may believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For these things happened so that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of him will be broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And again another scripture says, They will look toward whom they pierced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because of fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might remove the body of Jesus, and Pilate allowed him. Therefore he came and removed the body of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Nicodemus also came (he who at the first came to Jesus by night) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So they took the body of Jesus, and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, just as is the custom of the Jews to bury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now a garden was in the place where he was crucified, and in the garden a new sepulcher in which no man was yet laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Therefore because of the Jews' Preparation (because the sepulcher was near) they laid Jesus there.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene comes early, while it was still darkness, to the sepulcher, and sees the stone taken away from the sepulcher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore she runs and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and says to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the sepulcher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the two men ran together, and the other disciple ran ahead quicker than Peter and came first to the sepulcher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And after stooping down, he sees the linen cloths lying, yet he entered not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Simon Peter therefore comes following him, and he entered into the sepulcher. And he sees the linen cloths lying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and the face cloth that was on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but wrapped up in one place separately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore then the other disciple who came first to the sepulcher, also entered in, and he saw and believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they had not yet known the scripture that he must rise from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the disciples departed again to themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Mary had stood outside near the sepulcher weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped down to the sepulcher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And she sees two agents in white, sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus was lain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And those men say to her, Woman, why weep thou? She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And having said these things, she turned backward, and sees Jesus standing. And she had not known that it is Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus says to her, Woman, why weep thou? Whom seek thou? That woman, supposing that he is the gardener, says to him, Sir, if thou have taken him, tell me where thou have laid him, and I will take him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus says to her, Mary. After turning around, that woman says to him, Rabboni, which says, Teacher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus says to her, Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Mary Magdalene comes informing the disciples that she has seen the Lord, and he spoke these things to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore being evening that day, the first day of the week, and the doors having been shut where the disciples were who assembled because of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And having said this, he showed them his hands and side. His disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace to you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And after saying this, he breathed on them, and says to them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If ye forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them. If ye retain of any, they are retained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I may see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will, no, not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And after eight days his disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he says to Thomas, Bring thy finger here, and see my hands, and bring thy hand, and put into my side, and do not become faithless, but believing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus says to him, Because thou have seen me, thou have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And indeed therefore many other signs Jesus did in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But these are written, so that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life in his name.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Jesus manifested himself again to his disciples at the sea of Tiberias. And he revealed himself this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There were together, Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other men of his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter says to them, I am going to harvest fish. They say to him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and straightaway entered into the boat. And in that night they caught nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But having now become morning, Jesus stood on the shore. However the disciples had not seen that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore Jesus says to them, Children, have ye anything eatable? They answered him, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye will find. Therefore they cast, and they were no longer able to draw it for the magnitude of fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it is the Lord, he tied the coat around himself (for he was undressed), and threw himself into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the other disciples came in the skiff (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net of the fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So when they came to the land, they saw a fire of coals set, and fish laying on it, and bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus says to them, Bring from the fishes that ye now caught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty-three. And being so many, the net was not broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus says to them, Come, eat breakfast. And none of the disciples dared to query him, Who are thou? knowing that it is the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus therefore comes, and takes the bread, and gives to them, and the fish likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This is now a third time Jesus was manifested to his disciples after being raised from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So when they ate breakfast, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do thou love me more than these things? He says to him, Yea, Lord. Thou know that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my lambs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He says to him again a second time, Simon, son of Jonah, do thou love me? He says to him, Yea, Lord. Thou know that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He says to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, do thou love me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Do thou love me? And he said to him, Lord, thou know all things. Thou know that I love thee. Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Truly, truly, I say to thee, When thou were younger, thou girded thyself, and walked where thou would, but when thou become old, thou will stretch forth thy hands, and another will gird thee, and carry thee where thou do not want.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he will glorify God. And after saying this, he says to him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Peter, having turned around, sees the disciple whom Jesus loves, following, who also leaned near his chest at the supper, and said, Lord, who is the man betraying thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Having seen this man, Peter says to Jesus, Lord, and what of this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus says to him, If I want him to remain until I come, what is it to thee? Follow thou me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">This saying therefore went forth among the brothers, that that disciple does not die. And yet Jesus did not say to him, that he does not die, but, If I want him to remain until I come, what is it to thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and who wrote these things. And we know that his testimony is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there are also many other things, as many as Jesus did, which if they would be written every one, I suppose not even the world itself to make room for the books being written. Truly.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">to whom he also presented himself living, after his suffering, by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days, and speaking the things about the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And being assembled together, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, Which, he said, ye heard from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Because John indeed immersed in water, but ye will be immersed in the Holy Spirit after not many of these days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Indeed therefore having come together, they questioned him, saying, Lord, do thou restore the kingdom to Israel at this time?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said to them, It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father established in his own authority.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But ye will receive the power of the Holy Spirit that comes upon you. And ye will be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and as far as of the extremity of the earth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And while they were gazing at his going into the sky, behold, two men had also stood by them in white apparel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">who also said, Men, Galileans, why stand ye gazing into the sky? This Jesus who was taken up from you into the sky will so come, in that same way as ye saw him going into the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem having a sabbath day journey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when they came in, they went up into the upper floor where they were lodging, including, Peter and James and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">All these men were continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication, with women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And in those days, Peter, having stood up in the midst of the disciples (and there was a multitude of names at the same place, about a hundred twenty), he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Men, brothers, it was necessary for this scripture to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold through the mouth of David about Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And how do we each hear our own language in which we were born?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those dwelling in Mesopotamia, and Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya along Cyrene, and those Roman aliens, including Jews and proselytes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Cretes and Arabians. We hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, others saying to others, Whatever does this intend to be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But others, mocking said, They are filled of wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Peter having stood up with the eleven, raised his voice and spoke out to them, saying, Jewish men, and all who dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and listen to my sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For these men are not drunken, as ye suppose, for it is the third hour of the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But this is that which was spoken through the prophet Joel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it will be in the last days, says God, I will pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh. And your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your elders will dream dreams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And also on my bondmen and on my bondmaids in those days I will pour out from my Spirit, and they will prophesy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I will give wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The sun will be changed into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and wonderful day of the Lord comes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And it will be, that every man, whoever may call on the name of the Lord will be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Men, Israelites, hear ye these words. Jesus the Nazarene, a man shown by God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">this man, having been designated (by the purpose and foreknowledge of God) a man delivered up, ye, having taken by lawless hands, killed, having crucified,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For David speaks for him: I beheld the Lord always before me, because he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Because of this my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad. And moreover my flesh will also rest in hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Because thou will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will thou give thy Holy man to see decay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Thou made known to me the paths of life. Thou will fill me of joy with thy countenance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Men, brothers, being permitted to speak to you with openness about the patriarch David, that he both perished and was buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, to raise the Christ from the fruit of his loins according to flesh to sit upon his throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Having foreseen this, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that his soul was not left behind in Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This Jesus, God raised up, of which we are all witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore, exalted by the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he poured out this that ye now see and hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">until I place thine enemies a footstool of thy feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made him, this Jesus whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now having heard this, they were pierced in the heart, and said to Peter and the other apostles, Men, brothers, what will we do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Peter said to them, Repent ye, and be immersed each of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all those in afar, as many as the Lord our God may call.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And with many more other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, Be saved from this crooked generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Indeed therefore those who received his word gladly, were immersed. And there were added in that day about three thousand souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they were continuing steadfastly in the apostles doctrine, and in fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and the prayers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And fear developed in every soul. And many wonders and signs occurred through the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And all who believed were together, and had all things common.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And they sold properties and possessions, and divided them to all, according as any man had need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And continuing steadfastly, daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of nourishment in gladness and evenness of heart,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">praising God, and having favor with the whole populace. And the Lord was adding to the church daily those being saved.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now at the same time Peter and John were going up into the temple, at the hour of prayer, the ninth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And a certain man, being lame from his mother's belly, was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple, called Beautiful, to ask charity from those who entered into the temple,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">who, having seen Peter and John intending to go into the temple, asked charity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Peter, having gazed intently at him, with John, said, Look at us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he gave attention to them expecting to receive something from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Peter said, No silver and gold exists to me, but what I have, this I give thee. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, rise up and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And after taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up. And immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And leaping up, he stood and walked. And he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And all the people saw him walking and praising God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and they recognized him, that this was the man who sat for charity at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. And they were filled of astonishment and amazement at that which happened to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as the lame man who was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, amazed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Peter having seen, he responded to the people, Men, Israelites, why do ye marvel at this man? Or why do ye stare at us, as by our own power or piety we have made him to walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Boy Jesus, whom ye actually delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate who preferred to release that man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But ye denied the Holy and Righteous, and asked for a man, a murderer to be granted to you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And by faith in his name, this man whom ye see and know, his name has made strong. And faith through him has given him this complete soundness in the presence of you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And now, brothers, I know that ye did it from ignorance, as also your rulers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But this way God fulfilled what things were foretold, through the mouth of all his prophets, the Christ was to endure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Repent ye therefore, and be converted in order to wipe away your sins, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he may send Christ Jesus who has been pre-ordained for you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">whom heaven must indeed receive until the times of restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouth of all his holy prophets from the age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For Moses indeed said to the fathers, The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you, from your brothers, like me. Ye shall hear him in all things, as many as he might speak to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And every soul, whichever it will be, if it will not hear that prophet will be utterly destroyed from the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And also all the prophets from Samuel and those in succession, as many as spoke, also proclaimed these days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Ye are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant that God made for our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed all the patriarchies of the earth will be blessed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And as they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees approached them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And they threw hands on them, and put them in custody for the morrow, for it was now evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men became about five thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it came to pass on the morrow, to be assembled in Jerusalem, their rulers, and elders, and scholars,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the high priestly family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And after placing them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Peter being filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">if we are examined today about a good deed, of a feeble man, by what this man has been healed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by this, this man stands here before you healthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This is the stone that was rejected by you who build, which became into the head of the corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And salvation is not in any other man, for there is no other name under the heaven, that has been given among men, by which we must be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and having perceived that they are illiterate and uneducated men, they marveled. And they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they had nothing to contradict.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But after commanding them to go outside of the council, they conferred among each other,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">saying, What will we do to these men? For that indeed a notable sign has happened by them, is apparent to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But that it may not spread on further among the people, let us threaten them with threats to speak no longer in this name, to not one man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And having called them, they commanded them entirely, not to utter nor to teach in the name of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Peter and John having replied to them, they said, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken to you rather than God, judge ye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For we are not able not to speak what we saw and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they, having further threatened, released them, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people. Since all glorified God for that which happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the man was more than forty years old on whom this sign of healing had occurred.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And after being released, they went to their own men, and reported as many things as the chief priests and the elders said to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And those who heard lifted up a voice to God with one accord, and said, Thou Master, the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all things in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He who said through the mouth of thy boy David, Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate vain things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord, and against his Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For in truth, against thy holy Boy Jesus, whom thou anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">to do as many things as thy hand and thy purpose predetermined to happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">by thy stretching forth thy hand for healing, and signs and wonders to happen through the name of thy holy Boy Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they prayed, the place in which they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul. And not even one man said that anything of the things that was possessed by him was his own, but all things were common to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And with great power the apostles gave back the testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But Peter said, Ananias, why did Satan fill thy heart for thee to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back from the price of the land?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">While it remained, did it not remain to thee? And after it was sold, it was in thine authority. Why is it that thou have placed this matter in thy heart? Thou have not lied to men, but to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Ananias hearing these words, after falling down he expired. And great fear developed in all who heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And after rising the young men wrapped him, and having carried him out they buried him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to pass after an interval of three hours, his wife also came in, not knowing that which happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Peter responded to her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yes, for so much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Peter said to her, How is it that it was agreed by you to challenge the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who buried thy husband are at the door, and they will carry thee out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And immediately she fell down at his feet and expired. And after coming in the young men found her dead, and having carried her out, they buried her by her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And great fear developed in the whole church, and in all who heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And by the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders happened among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But of the rest no man dared join them, but the people magnified them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And more who believe were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">so as to bring the feeble to the thoroughfares, and to place them on cots and mats, so that while coming, the shadow of Peter might at the least overshadow some of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And also the populace of the cities round about came together to Jerusalem bringing the feeble, and those tormented by unclean spirits, who were all healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But after rising up, the high priest and all those with him (being the sect of the Sadducees) were filled of envy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they threw their hands on the apostles, and put them in the public prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But an agent of the Lord opened the prison doors by night, and after leading them out, he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Go ye, and after standing in the temple, speak to the people all the sayings of this Life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And having heard, they entered into the temple at early morning, and taught. But the high priest having arrived, and those with him, they called the council together, and all the senate of the sons of Israel. And they sent to the prison for them to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the subordinates who came did not find them in the prison. And having returned, they reported,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">saying, We found the prison indeed shut in all security, and the guards standing before the doors, but after opening, we found no man inside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now when they heard these words, the high priest, and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests, were perplexed about them, whatever this would become.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But a certain man who arrived, reported to them, Behold, the men whom ye put in the prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then after departing, the captain with the subordinates brought them, not with violence, for they feared the people, lest they would be stoned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And having brought them, they placed them in the council. And the high priest demanded them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">saying, Did we not command by an order for you not to teach in this name? And behold, ye have filled Jerusalem of your doctrine, and intend to bring upon us this man's blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Peter and the apostles having answered, they said, We must obey God rather than men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye murdered, having hung on a tree.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And Moses was reared in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But when a forty year time span was fulfilled by him, it came into his heart to go help his brothers, the sons of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And after seeing a certain man suffering wrong, he defended him, and did vengeance for the man being oppressed, having smitten the Egyptian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he presumed his brothers understood that, by his hand, God was giving them salvation, but they did not understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And on the next day he was seen by them as they fought, and he was reconciling them for peace, having said, Men, ye are brothers. Why is it that ye wrong each other?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But the man doing wrong to his neighbor thrust him away, having said, Who appointed thee a ruler and a judge over us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Do thou not want to kill me, as thou killed the Egyptian yesterday?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Moses fled at this word, and became an alien in the land of Midian, where he begot two sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And forty years having been fulfilled, an agent of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai in a flame of fire of a bush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when Moses looked, he wondered at the sight. And as he approached to examine, a voice of the Lord came to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. But Moses, who developed trembling, dared not examine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the Lord said to him, Put off the shoes from thy feet, for the place on which thou stand is holy ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Having looked, I saw the oppression of my people in Egypt, and I heard their groaning, and I came down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">This Moses whom they refused, having said, Who appointed thee a ruler and a judge? This man God sent, a ruler and a liberator by the hand of the agent who appeared to him in the bush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This man brought them forth after performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you, from your brothers, like me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">This is he who became in the congregation in the wilderness with the agent who spoke to him on the mount Sinai, and of our fathers who received living oracles to give to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">To whom our fathers did not want to become obedient, but they thrust away, and turned back in their heart to Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">after saying to Aaron, Make gods for us who will lead us. For this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has happened to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And they made a calf in those days, and offered up sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But God turned, and gave them over to serve the host of heaven, just as it is written in the book of the prophets, Did ye offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, the images that ye made to worship them. And I will deport you beyond Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness, just as he arranged (he who spoke to Moses), to make it according to the pattern that he had seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Which also our fathers, having received in succession, brought in with Joshua into the possession of the nations whom God drove out from the presence of our fathers, until the days of David</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">who found favor in the sight of God. And he asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">But Solomon built him a house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">However the Most High does not dwell in man-made temples, just as the prophet says,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The heaven is to me a throne, and the earth a footstool of my feet. What house will ye build for me? says the Lord. Or what is the place of my rest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Did not my hand make all these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers, ye also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold about the coming of the Righteous man, of whom ye now have become betrayers and murderers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">who received the law at directions of agents, and did not keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Now when they heard these things, they were split with a saw in their hearts, and they gnashed their teeth against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But being full of the Holy Spirit, having gazed into heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And he said, Look, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">But they, having cried out in a great voice, held their ears shut, and rushed upon him with one accord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And having expelled him out of the city, they stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments beside the feet of a young man called Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And they stoned Stephen, who was calling and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And having knelt down, he cried out in a great voice, Lord, place not this sin to them. And after saying this, he slept.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Saul was approving the killing of him. And on that day there developed a great persecution against the church at Jerusalem. And they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And devout men arranged to bury Stephen, and they made great lamentation over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Saul was ravaging the church, entering from house to house. Dragging both men and women, he gave them over to prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Indeed therefore those who were scattered abroad passed through proclaiming the good news, the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Philip, who went down to a city of Samaria, proclaimed the Christ to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the multitudes unanimously heeded the things that were spoken by Philip during their listening and seeing the signs that he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For of many of those who had unclean spirits, they came out, crying in a great voice. And many who were paralyzed, and who were lame, were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there became great joy in that city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But a certain man in the city, Simon by name, was formerly practicing sorcery, and fascinating the nation of Samaria, saying himself to be some great man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">to whom they gave heed, from small to great, saying, This man is the great power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they heeded him, because he fascinated them for a considerable time with the sorceries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when they believed Philip preaching good news, the things about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were immersed, both men and women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Simon himself also believed. And after being immersed, he was continuing with Philip. And seeing miracles and signs occurring, he was astonished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria has received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">who, when they came down, prayed for them, so that they might receive the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">for it was not yet fallen upon any of them. They were only immersed in the name of the Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he brought money to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">saying, Give me also this power, so that on whomever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Peter said to him, Thy silver with thee, may it be for destruction, because thou thought to obtain the gift of God by money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">There is no part nor lot for thee in this matter, for thy heart is not straight in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Repent therefore from this thine evil, and beg God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart will be forgiven thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For I perceive that thou are in the gall of bitterness and the bond of unrighteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And having answered, Simon said, Beg ye to the Lord for me, so that none of which things ye have spoken may come upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Indeed therefore, having solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the good news in many villages of the Samaritans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And an agent of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desolate region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And after rising, he went. And behold a man, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a high official of Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he was returning, and sitting in his chariot, and reading the prophet Isaiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and be joined to this chariot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And after running near, Philip heard him reading the prophet Isaiah. And he said, Do thou also really understand the things that thou read?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he said, For how can I unless some man may guide me? And he encouraged Philip, after coming up, to sit with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now the passage of the scripture that he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb, mute before shearing him, thus he opened not his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">In his lowly condition his justice was taken away. And who will describe his generation, because his life was taken from the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And having answered, the eunuch said to Philip, I ask thee, about whom does the prophet say this, about himself, or about some other man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Philip having opened his mouth, and having begun from this scripture, he preached the good news to him-the man Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch says, Look, water! What prevents me to be immersed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">[This verse in not in the majority of the Greek manuscripts.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he commanded the chariot to stand still. And they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he immersed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when they came up out of the water, Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through all the cities he preached the good news until he came to Caesarea.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But Saul, still breathing threat and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, after going to the high priest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">he requested letters from him for Damascus, to the synagogues, so that if he found any who were of the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And on going, it came to pass for him to approach Damascus. And suddenly there shone around him a light out of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And after falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do thou persecute me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said, Who are thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But arise, and enter into the city, and it will be told thee what thou must do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the men who traveled with him had stopped, speechless, indeed hearing the voice, but seeing no man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Saul arose from the ground. And when his eyes were opened, he saw no man. But they brought him into Damascus, leading him by the hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he was three days not seeing, and did not eat or drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus, named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold me, Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the Lord said to him, After rising, go into the street called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas, a man named Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he is praying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he saw in a vision a man named Ananias who came in and laid a hand on him, so that he might receive sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how many evil things he did to thy sanctified at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the Lord said to him, Go, because this man is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before Gentiles and kings, and sons of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For I will give him a glimpse of how many things it is necessary for him to suffer for my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Ananias departed and entered into the house. And having laid hands on him he said, Brother Saul, the Lord, he who appeared to thee on the road on which thou came, has sent me so that thou may receive sight, and be filled of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And straightaway there fell from his eyes, like scales, and he looked up. And immediately after rising up, he was immersed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And having received nourishment, he was strengthened. And Saul became with the disciples in Damascus some days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And straightaway he proclaimed the Christ in the synagogues, that this man is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And all those who heard were amazed, and said, Is this not the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem who call on this name? And he has come here for this, so that he might bring them bound to the chief priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Saul was strengthened more, and was confounding the Jews who dwell at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And after considerable days were fulfilled, the Jews plotted to destroy him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but their plot was known to Saul. And they watched the gates both day and night so that they might destroy him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But the disciples, after taking him by night, let him down through the wall, having lowered him in a hamper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he attempted to join with the disciples, and they all feared him, not believing that he is a disciple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Barnabas having taken him, he brought him to the apostles. And he related to them how he saw the Lord on the road, and that he spoke to him, and how he spoke boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists, but they attempted to destroy him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But when the brothers knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him away to Tarsus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Indeed therefore the congregations throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified. And, going in the fear of the Lord and in the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And it came to pass, Peter, passing through all parts, to also come down to the sanctified who dwell at Lydda.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he found there a certain man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed, laying on a bed for eight years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals thee. Arise and make thy bed. And straightaway he arose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And all those dwelling at Lydda and Sharon who saw him, turned to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Now at Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which, being translated, is called Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and charities that she did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And in those days, having been ill, she happened to die. And after washing her, they laid her in an upper chamber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And since Lydda is near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter is in it, they sent two men to him, exhorting him not to delay to go through to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And after rising, Peter went with them, whom, after coming, they brought into the upper chamber. And all the widows stood by him weeping, and exhibiting the coats and garments, as many things as Dorcas made being with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But Peter, having sent them all out, having knelt down, he prayed. And having turned to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And the woman opened her eyes. And when she saw Peter, she sat up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And having given her a hand, he raised her up. And after calling the sanctified and the widows, he presented her alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And it became known throughout the whole of Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And it came to pass for him to remain considerable days at Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now a certain man was in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of the band called Italian,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">a devout man, and fearing God with all his house, and doing many charities for the people, and beseeching God always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He saw plainly in a vision about the ninth hour of the day, an agent of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And after gazing at him, and having become afraid, he said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thy charities have come up for a memorial before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And now send men to Joppa and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">This man lodges with a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is beside the seaside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when the agent speaking to Cornelius departed, having called two of his housemen, and a devout soldier of those who personally served him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and after reporting all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now on the morrow, while those men were traveling and approaching the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he became very hungry and wanted to eat. But while those men prepared, a trance fell upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he sees heaven opened, and a certain container descending to him, like a great sheet bound at four corners, and being lowered to the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">in which were all the four-footed things of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And a voice came to him, After rising, Peter, kill and eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Peter said, Not so, Lord, because I have never eaten anything profane or unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And a voice again for a second time, What God has cleansed, thou shall not make profane.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And this happened thrice, and again the vessel was taken up into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now while Peter was bewildered in himself whatever the vision which he saw might be, that lo, the men who were sent from Cornelius, having inquired the house of Simon, stood at the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And after calling out they asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, lodges here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And while Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, men seek thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But after rising, go down, and go with them, doubting nothing, because I have sent them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And having gone down to the men, Peter said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek. What is the cause for which ye are here?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man, and fearing God, and being well testified by the whole nation of the Jews, was divinely warned by a holy agent to summon thee to his house, and to hear sayings from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So, having invited them in, he lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went forth with them, and certain of the brothers from Joppa went with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And on the morrow they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and close friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when it came about for Peter to enter, Cornelius, having met him, after falling down at his feet, worshiped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But Peter lifted him up, saying, Stand up. I am also myself a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as he conversed with him, he went in and found many who came together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he said to them, Ye understand how it is unlawful for a Jewish man to fraternize or to visit with a foreign man, and yet God demonstrated to me not to call one man profane or unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And so I came without objection when summoned. I ask therefore for what matter ye summoned me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour, and the ninth hour praying in my house. And behold, a man stood before me in bright apparel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he says, Cornelius, thy prayer was heard, and thy charities are remembered before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter. This man lodges in the house of Simon, a tanner, beside the sea, who, after coming, will speak to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou did well having come. Now therefore we are all present in the sight of God, to hear all the things commanded thee by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And having opened his mouth, Peter said, In truth, I am overwhelmed that God is not partial,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">but in every nation, he who fears him, and works righteousness, is acceptable to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The word that he sent forth to the sons of Israel, preaching good news, peace by Jesus Christ (this man is Lord of all),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">ye know, the word having occurred throughout the whole of Judea beginning from Galilee after the immersion that John preached-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus of Nazareth-how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who passed through doing good, and healing all those who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem, whom also they killed, having hung on a tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">This man God raised up the third day, and granted him to become manifest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">not to all the people, but to witnesses who were previously chosen by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he arose from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to solemnly testify that this is the man designated by God, judge of the living and the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">To this man all the prophets testify, that every man who believes in him, to receive remission of sins through his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">While Peter still spoke these sayings, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And the faithful men of circumcision were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because also on the Gentiles the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For they heard them speaking in tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Can any man forbid the water for these not to be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he commanded them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to remain some days.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also received the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, the men of circumcision contended against him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">saying, Thou went in to uncircumcised men, having also eaten with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when Peter began, he expounded to them in order, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain container descending, as a great sheet being lowered from heaven by four corners, and it came as far as to me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">having gazed at which, I was examining. And I saw the four footed things of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, kill and eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I said, Not so, Lord, because nothing profane or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But a voice answered me for a second time out of heaven, What God has cleansed, thou shall not make profane.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this happened thrice, and all were drawn up again into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And behold, immediately three men stood at the house in which I was, who were sent from Caesarea to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the man's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he informed us how he saw the agent in his house, who stood and said to him, Send forth men to Joppa, and summon Simon, the man surnamed Peter,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">who will speak sayings to thee, by which thou will be saved, thou and all thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as also on us at the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I remembered the saying of the Lord, how he said, John indeed immersed in water, but ye will be immersed in the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If then God gave to them the identical gift as also to us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, but what power was I to hinder God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they heard these things, they relaxed and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Indeed therefore those who were scattered abroad from the persecution that occurred against Stephen passed through as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to none except Jews only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And some of them were men, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who, having come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching good news, the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the word about them was heard in the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they dispatched Barnabas to pass through as far as Antioch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">who, having arrived, and having seen the grace of God, rejoiced. And he encouraged all, with purpose of heart, to remain in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a considerable multitude was added to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Barnabas departed to Tarsus to seek Saul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass a whole year for them to be assembled in the congregation, and to teach a considerable multitude, and to call the disciples Christians, first at Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And one of them named Agabus, after standing up, signified by the Spirit there was going be a great famine in the whole world, which also happened under Claudius Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the disciples, as any man prospered, determined, each of them regarding aid, to send to the brothers who dwell in Judea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">which also they did, having sent it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now about that time Herod the king threw on hands to harm some of those from the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And after seeing that it was pleasing the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also (and those were the days of unleavened bread),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">whom, having also arrested, he put in prison, having delivered to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Indeed therefore Peter was kept in the prison, but fervent prayer was being made by the church to God for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Herod was about to bring him forth, that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound by two chains. And guards in front of the door guarded the prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And behold, an agent of the Lord stood near, and light shone in the room. And after striking the side of Peter, he raised him up, saying, Get up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the agent said to him, Gird thyself, and tie on thy sandals. And he did so. And he says to him, Throw on thy garment, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And after going out, he followed him. And he had not seen that the thing happening by the agent was true, but presumed to see a vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when they passed a first and a second watch, they came to the iron gate, the one leading to the city, which opened spontaneously to them. And after going out, they advanced one street. And straightaway the agent withdrew from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when Peter came to himself, he said, Now I know truly, that the Lord dispatched his agent and delivered me out of the hand of Herod and all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And having realized it, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, surnamed Mark, where a considerable were gathered and praying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when Peter knocked the door of the gate, a servant girl named Rhoda came to hearken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And after recognizing Peter's voice, she did not open the gate for joy, but having ran in, she reported Peter was standing in front of the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they said to her, Thou are mad. But she insisted to have it so. But they said, It is his agent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him, and were astonished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But after motioning to them with the hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord brought him out of the prison. And he said, Report these things to James, and to the brothers. And having departed, he went to a different place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But having become day, there was no small stir among the soldiers what then became of Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Herod, who sought for him, and not having found, having examined the guards, he commanded them to be led away. And going down from Judea to Caesarea, he remained there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now Herod was angry at the Tyrians and Sidonians. But they came with one accord to him, and, having persuaded Blastus the man over the king's bedchamber, they requested peace, because their country was sustained from the monarchy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And at a set day Herod, having arrayed himself in royal apparel, and having sat on the tribunal, he made an oration to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the populace shouted, The voice of a god, and not of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And immediately an agent of the Lord struck him, because he did not give glory to God. And after becoming worm-eaten, he expired.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the word of God grew and multiplied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Barnabas and Saul turned back in Jerusalem after fulfilling the service, also having taken along John who was surnamed Mark.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there were some men from the congregation that was in Antioch, prophets and teachers, including Barnabas, and Simeon called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen reared with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And while they were serving the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate to me now Barnabas and Saul for the work that I have called them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then, having fasted and prayed and laid hands on them, they sent them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Indeed therefore these men, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed for Cyprus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And after becoming in Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they also had John for a helper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And after going through the island as far as Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a Jewish false prophet, whose name was Bar-jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man, having summoned Barnabas and Saul, sought to hear the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Elymas the sorcerer (for so his name is translated) opposed them, seeking to deviate the proconsul from the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Saul (the man is also Paul) having been filled with the Holy Spirit, and having gazed on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">said, O man full of all deceit and all recklessness, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, will thou not cease distorting the straight ways of the Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now, behold, a hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou will be blind, not seeing the sun until a time. And immediately there fell on him gloom and darkness, and going around he sought hand-guides.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the proconsul, who saw that which happened, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now those around Paul, having launched from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia. But John, having departed from them, returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they, having passed through from Perga, arrived at Antioch of Pisidia, and after entering into the synagogue on the sabbath day, they sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And after the reading of the law and the prophets the synagogue rulers sent to them, saying, Men, brothers, if there is among you a word of exhortation for the people, speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Paul having stood up, and having motioned with the hand, he said, Men! Israelites and those who fear God, listen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and raised up the people during the sojourn in the land of Egypt. And with a lofty arm he brought them out of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And for about a forty-year time he was patient with them in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he allotted their land to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And after these things he gave them judges about four hundred and fifty years until Samuel the prophet.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And having removed him, he raised up David for a king to them, also about whom he said, when he testified, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man according to my heart, who will do all my purposes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">From this man's seed according to promise, God brought salvation to Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">John having earlier proclaimed, before his coming presence, the immersion of repentance to Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, Whom do ye suppose me to be? I am not, but behold, he comes after me of whom I am not worthy to loose the shoes of his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Men, brothers, sons of the race of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you the word of this salvation was sent.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And not having found one cause of death in him, they asked for Pilate to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when they completed all the things written about him, having taken him down from the tree, they laid him in a tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But God raised him from the dead,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">Therefore also he says in another, Thou will not give thy Holy Man to see decay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For indeed David, who served his own generation in the plan of God, became asleep, and was added near his fathers, and saw decay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he whom God raised up saw no decay.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="42">And as they went out from the synagogue of the Jews, the Gentiles urged that these sayings be spoken to them the next sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Now after the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, while conversing, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And on the coming sabbath almost all the city was assembled to hear the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled of envy, and contradicted the things spoken by Paul, contradicting and slandering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But having spoken boldly, Paul and Barnabas said, It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken first to you, but since ye thrust it away, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">For so the Lord has commanded us: I have placed thee for a light of Gentiles, for thee to be for salvation as far as the extremity of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And hearing this, the Gentiles were glad and glorified the word of the Lord. And as many as were appointed for eternal life believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And the word of the Lord was spread abroad through the whole region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But the Jews incited the religious women, and the prominent women, and the principle men of the city, and raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas. And they threw them out of their boundaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">But after shaking off the dust of their feet against them, they came to Iconium.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in Iconium according to the same thing, for them to enter into the synagogue of the Jews, and to speak so as for a great quantity to believe, both of Jews and of Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the disobedient Jews aroused the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil against the brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Indeed therefore they remained a considerable time speaking boldly in the Lord-him testifying to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to occur by their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the majority of the city was divided, and verily there were those with the Jews, and those with the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as a violent movement developed, both of the Gentiles and of the Jews, with their rulers, to denounce and to stone them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">having become aware of it, they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the neighboring region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there they were preaching the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And a certain man was sitting in Lystra, disabled in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's belly, who had never walked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This man was listening to Paul speaking, who, having gazed at him, and having seen that he has faith to be healed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">said with a great voice, Stand correctly on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the multitudes who saw what Paul did, lifted up their voice, speaking Lycaonian, The gods came down to us, having become like men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they actually called Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the man who led the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the priest of Zeus, being in front of their city, after bringing oxen and garlands to the gates, wanted to sacrifice with the multitudes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard, having torn their garments, they rushed into the crowd, crying out</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and saying, Men, why are ye doing these things? We also are men of like nature with you, proclaiming good news to you, to turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all the things in them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who in the generations that have passed allowed all the nations to go in their own ways,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">although he did not leave himself without evidence, doing good and giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts of food and gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And saying these things, they scarcely restrained the multitudes not to sacrifice to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium. And having persuaded the crowds, and having stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city, after presuming him to be dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the disciples having surrounded him, after rising, he came into the city. And on the morrow he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And having preached the good news to that city, and having made considerable disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that it was necessary for us to enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having appointed elders for them in every congregation, having prayed with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord, in whom they had believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And after passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they spoke the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and from there they sailed to Antioch, from where they were delivered to the grace of God for the work that they fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And after arriving, and after gathering the assembly together, they reported as many things as God did with them, and that he opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And certain men, who came down from Judea, taught the brothers, Unless ye will be circumcised in the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore, no small dissension and debate having developed with Paul and Barnabas against them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas, and some other men from them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem about this issue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Indeed therefore, having been helped for the trip by the congregation, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles. And they caused great joy to all the brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And after arriving in Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders. And they reported as many things as God did with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But some of the men who believed from the sect of the Pharisees rose up, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the apostles and the elders were assembled together to see about this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when much debate occurred, Peter having risen up, he said to them, Men, brothers, ye know that from past days among us, God chose the Gentiles to hear through my mouth the word of the good news, and to believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God, who knows the heart, testified to them, having given them the Holy Spirit, just as also to us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But through the grace of the Lord Jesus, we believe to be saved, in the same way as those men also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And all the multitude kept silent, and they heard Barnabas and Paul describing how many signs and wonders God did among the Gentiles through them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And after they were quiet, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, hear me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Simeon described how God first came to help, to take from the Gentiles a people for his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And to this the words of the prophets agree, as it is written,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">so that the rest of men might seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called upon them, says the Lord, who does these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Known to God from the age are all his works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore I judge not to trouble those from the Gentiles who are turning to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but to write to them, to abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For Moses from generations past, has from city to city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues on every sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then it was decided by the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, to send men chosen from them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">it was decided by us, having become unanimous, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">men who have given over their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, themselves also declaring the same things by speech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For it was decided by the Holy Spirit, and by us, to lay upon you not one greater burden than these necessary things:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication, keeping yourselves from which, ye will do well. Be strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Indeed therefore after being dismissed, they came to Antioch, and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And after reading it, they rejoiced for the encouragement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brothers by much speech, and strengthened them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And after spending some time, they were dismissed with peace from the brothers to the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">[This verse is not in the majority of the Greek manuscripts.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching good news, the word of the Lord, with many others also.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul wanted this man to go forth with him. And having taken him, he circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those regions, for they had all seen that his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And as they were going through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep, which were determined by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Indeed therefore the congregations were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But having passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And on the sabbath day we went outside the city beside a river, where it was customary for prayer to be. And having sat down, we spoke to the women who came together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, a woman who worshiped God, was listening, whose heart the Lord opened to heed the things being spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when she was immersed, and her household, she urged us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, after coming into my house, remain. And she constrained us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, as we were going to prayer, for a certain servant girl having a spirit of divination to meet us, who brought her masters much business by soothsaying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This woman having followed Paul and us was crying out, saying, These men are bondmen of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And she did this on many days. But Paul, after being exasperated, and having turned, he said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out the same hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when her masters saw that the hope of their business was gone, having seized Paul and Silas, they dragged them into the marketplace to the rulers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And after bringing them to the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, disturb our city,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and proclaim customs that are not permitted for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the multitude rose up together against them. And the magistrates, having torn off their clothes, commanded to beat them with rods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having laid many blows upon them, they cast them into prison, having ordered the jailor to guard them securely,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">who, having received such an order, threw them into the inner prison, and fastened their feet in the stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now toward midnight Paul and Silas, while praying, were singing praises to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And suddenly a great earthquake occurred, so as for the foundations of the prison to shake. And immediately all the doors were opened, and the bonds of all the men were unfastened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the jailor, who became awake and who saw the prison doors opened, having drawn out a sword was going to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to have fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Paul cried out in a great voice, saying, Do nothing harmful to thyself, for we are all here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And having asked for lights, he rushed in, and having become trembling, he fell down before Paul and Silas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And after bringing them outside, he said, Sirs, what must I do so that I may be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou will be saved, thou and thy household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all those in his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And having taken them in that hour of the night, he washed from the stripes, and was immersed, he and all those of him, immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And having brought them into his house, he set out a table, and rejoiced, having believed in God with all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But when it became day, the magistrates sent out the police, saying, Release those men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the jailor reported these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent out so that ye may be released. Now therefore after coming out, go in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly, uncondemned men, being Romans, they cast us into prison, and now they thrust us out privately? Certainly not, but after coming, they shall lead us out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the police reported these sayings to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And having come they besought them, and when they brought them out, they asked them to go out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And having departed from the prison, they came in to Lydia. And after seeing the brothers, they encouraged them, and departed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And according to Paul's custom, he went in to them, and for three sabbaths he discoursed with them from the scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">explaining and pointing out that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead, and, This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And some of them were persuaded, and joined with Paul and Silas, and of the devout Greeks a great quantity, and of the prominent women not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the disobedient Jews having taken along certain evil men of the marketplaces, and having gathered a mob, were rioting the city. And having stood by the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the populace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And not having found them, they dragged Jason and some brothers to the city rulers, shouting, The men who have agitated the world, these are present here also,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">whom Jason has received. And all these men are acting against the decrees of Caesar, asserting another man to be king, Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they disturbed the multitude and the city rulers when they heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And after taking bond from Jason and the other men, they released them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the brothers straightaway sent both Paul and Silas away through the night to Berea, who, when they arrived, went into the synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all willingness, examining the scriptures daily, if it has these things this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Indeed therefore many of them believed, also of the prominent Greek women, and of men, not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when the Jews of Thessalonica also learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea, they came there also, agitating the crowds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But then straightaway the brothers sent Paul away to go as far as to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy remained there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And those who brought Paul led him as far as Athens. And after taking a command for Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him quickly, they departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But while Paul waited for them in Athens, his spirit was aroused within him, seeing the city being completely idolatrous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Indeed therefore he was discoursing in the synagogue with the Jews, and with those who worship, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, Whatever does this babbler want to say? But others, He seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities, because he brought the good news-Jesus and the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And having taken him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying, Can we understand what this new doctrine is, being spoken by thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For thou bring some surprising things to our ears. Therefore, we want to know whatever these things aim to be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now all the Athenians, and the foreigners who dwell alien there, were at leisure in nothing else, than to tell or to hear something new.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And having stood in the middle of the Areopagus, Paul said, Athenian men, I perceive you as deity-fearing in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For, passing through and examining your religious objects, I also found an altar on which had been engraved, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye worship unknowingly, him I proclaim to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">nor is he served by the hands of men, as needing anything, since he himself gives to all life, and breath, with all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he made from one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth, having determined prescribed times, and the limits of their occupancy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">to search for the Lord, if indeed perhaps they might grope for him and find him, although being not far from each one of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For in him we live, and move, and exist, as also some of the performers from you have said, For of him we are also offspring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Being therefore offspring of God, we ought not think the Divine to be like gold, or silver, or stone handiwork of the skill and thought of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Indeed therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now commands for all men everywhere to repent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Because he appointed a day during which he is going to judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he appointed, having provided assurance to all men because he raised him from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But when they heard the resurrection of the dead, of course they mocked, but others said, We will hear thee again about this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And so Paul departed from among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But some men, having joined with him, believed, among whom was also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after these things Paul having separated from Athens, he came to Corinth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And having found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by origin, who recently came from Italy, and his wife Priscilla, because Claudius arranged for all the Jews to separate from Rome, he came to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and was working, for they were of the tentmakers craft.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he was discoursing in the synagogue every sabbath, and was persuading Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was being held by the Spirit, fully testifying to the Jews, Jesus the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when they opposed and slandered him, having shaken out his clothes, he said to them, Your blood is upon your heads. I am clean. From henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And having departed from there, he went into the house of a certain man named Justus, who worships God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Crispus, the synagogue ruler, believed in the Lord with his whole household, and many of the Corinthians who heard believed, and were immersed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Lord spoke to Paul by a vision at night, Fear not, but speak, and be not silent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">because I am with thee, and no man will lay upon thee to harm thee, because many people are for me in this city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he remained a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord attacked Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">saying, This man is persuading men to worship God against the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If therefore indeed it were some crime or evil reckless deed, O ye Jews, I would have tolerated you according to the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if it is an issue about a word and names and the law from you, look ye yourselves, for I do not intend to be a judge of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he drove them from the judgment seat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But all the Greeks, having taken Sosthenes the synagogue ruler, were beating him in front of the judgment seat. And Gallio was not going to judge, even of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But Paul, who still remained considerable days with the brothers, having separated, sailed away to Syria (and with him Priscilla and Aquila), having shaved his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he came to Ephesus and left behind those there, but having entered into the synagogue himself, he discoursed with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when they asked him to remain on more time with them, he did not consent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but separated from them, having said, I must definitely keep the coming feast at Jerusalem, but I will return again to you, God willing. And he launched from Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And after coming down to Caesarea, having gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And after spending some time, he departed, passing through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, successively, strengthening all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by origin, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus, being mighty in the scriptures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This was a man who was instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in the Spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things about the Lord, knowing only the immersion of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And this man began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside, and expounded to him the way of God more accurately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when he intended to pass through into Achaia, the brothers wrote, having encouraged the disciples to receive him, who, when he arrived, assisted much those who believed through the grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he forcibly refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the scriptures Jesus to be the Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass while Apollos was at Corinth, for Paul, having passed through the upper regions, to come to Ephesus. And having found some disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">he said to them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they said to him, But we have not even heard if there is a Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said to them, Into what then were ye immersed? And they said, Into John's immersion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Paul said, John indeed immersed an immersion of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus, the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when they heard this, they were immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Paul having laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues, and prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And all the men were about twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And after entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for three months, discoursing and persuading the things about the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, having withdrawn from them, he separated the disciples, discoursing daily in the school of a certain Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this happened for two years, so as for all those dwelling in Asia to hear the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so as to even bring handkerchiefs or aprons from his skin to those who were incapacitated and to free their infirmities from them, and the evil spirits to go out from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But some of the wandering Jewish exorcists, attempted to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had the evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there were some sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, seven doing this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And having answered, the evil spirit said, I know Jesus and I recognize Paul, but who are ye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the man in whom was the evil spirit, leaping on them, and having overpowered them, he prevailed against them, so as for them to flee out of that house naked and wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, to those who dwell at Ephesus. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And many of those who have believed came, confessing, and reporting their practices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And a considerable number of those who practiced magical things, having brought their books together, burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thus the word of the Lord was growing mightily and was prevailing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now when these things were fulfilled, Paul decided in the spirit, after passing through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, having said, After becoming there, I must also see Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And having sent into Macedonia two of those who help him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And about that time there developed no small stir about the Way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For a certain silversmith named Demetrius who makes silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little work to the craftsmen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">to whom also (having assembled the workmen about such things) he said, Men, ye know that our prosperity is from this work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And ye see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but almost in all Asia, this man Paul, having persuaded them, turned away a considerable multitude, saying that there are no gods made by hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And not only is this our part liable to come into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis is going to be regarded for nothing, and also her magnificence be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when they heard this, having become full of wrath, they cried out, saying, The great Artemis of Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the whole city was filled with the confusion. And they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when Paul wanted to enter in to the crowd, the disciples did not let him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And also some of the Asian officers, being their friends, having sent to him, implored him not to give himself into the theatre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Indeed therefore some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was confused, and most had not seen why they had come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they urged forward Alexander out of the multitude, having put him forward from the Jews. And Alexander having waved his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But after recognizing that he was a Jew, one voice developed from them all, crying out for about two hours, The great Artemis of Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when the town clerk calmed the multitude, he says, Ephesian men, now who is the man who does not know the city of the Ephesians being temple-guardian of the great goddess Artemis, and of what fell from Zeus?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Therefore these things being undeniable, ye ought to be restrained, and do nothing rash.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For ye brought these men, who are neither sacrilegious nor blaspheming your goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Indeed therefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen with him, have a matter against any man, forums are brought, and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse each other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And if ye seek anything about other things, it will be decided in the assembly within law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For we are also in danger to be accused about the uproar today, there being no cause about which we can give account of this commotion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after the uproar ceased, Paul having summoned the disciples and having embraced them, he departed to go into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And having passed through those parts, and having exhorted them with many words, he came into Greece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And having spent three months there, and a conspiracy having developed against him by Jews, intending to go up into Syria, a decision developed to return through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater a Berean, and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius a Derbean, and Timothy, and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">These men, who went ahead, awaited us at Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas within five days, where we stayed seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And upon the first day of the week, the disciples having come together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the morrow. And he prolonged his speech until midnight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there were considerable lights in the upper floor where we were gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And a certain young man named Eutychus sitting in the window, being carried away by deep sleep (Paul discoursing on more), being carried away by sleep, he fell down below from the third floor, and was taken up dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Paul having come down, he fell on him, and having embraced him he said, Be not troubled, for his life is in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And after getting up, and having broken bread and eaten, and having conversed for a considerable time, until dawn, thus he departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they brought the boy alive, and were not a little comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we, having gone ahead to the ship, went up to Assos, intending from there to take up Paul, for so it was arranged, he himself intending to go on foot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he met with us at Assos, having taken him up, we came to Mitylene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And having sailed from there on the next day, we arrived opposite Chios, and the next day we came near to Samos. And having remained in Trogyllium, on the following day we came to Miletus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For Paul determined to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not happen to lose time in Asia. For he was hastening, if it were possible, for him to become at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And from Miletus having sent to Ephesus, he summoned the elders of the congregation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they came to him, he said to them, Ye know, from the first day in which I stepped in Asia, how I became with you all the time,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears and trials that befell me by the conspiracies of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">How I kept back nothing of these things that are beneficial, not to inform you, and to teach you in public, and from house to house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now behold, I, bound in the spirit, am going to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me in it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">except that the Holy Spirit testifies from city to city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But I make nothing of the matter, nor do I hold my life precious to myself, so as to fully complete my course with joy, and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to solemnly testify the good news of the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And now behold, I have seen that ye will no longer see my face, ye all among whom I passed through preaching the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore I solemnly declare to you this day, that I am clean from the blood of all men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For I did not withdraw from declaring to you the whole plan of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit placed you guardians, to tend the church of the Lord and God, which he purchased by his own blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And from you yourselves men will rise up, speaking distorted things, to draw away the disciples after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore watch ye, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease warning each one with tears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And now brothers, I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build up, and to give you an inheritance among all those who have been sanctified.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">Ye yourselves know that these hands served my needs, and to those who were with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I gave you a glimpse of all things, that so laboring ye ought to aid the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And having spoken these things, having knelt down, he prayed with them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And there developed considerable weeping of all. And having fallen on Paul's neck, they kissed him much,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And having come to us, and having taken Paul's belt, having bound both his feet and hands, he said, The Holy Spirit says these things: Thus the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man whose belt this is, and will deliver him into the hands of Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when we heard these things, both we and those local men urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Paul answered, What are ye doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I fare ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And since he was not persuaded, we were quiet, having said, May the will of the Lord happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And after these days, having made preparation, we went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And also the disciples from Caesarea went together with us, bringing a certain Mnason, a Cypriot, an old disciple with whom we would lodge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when we came to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And on the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And having greeted them, he reported one by one what God did among the Gentiles through his ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the men heard, they glorified God, having said to him, Thou see, brother, how many thousands there are of the Jews who have believed, and they are all zealots of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they were informed about thee, that thou teach all the Jews throughout the nations desertion from Moses, telling them not to circumcise the children nor to walk by the customs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What is it therefore? Certainly the multitude needs to get together, for they will hear that thou have come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore do this that we say to thee. Four men are with us who have a vow on themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Having taken these, be purified with them. And pay expenses for them, so that they may shave the head. And all may know, that things of which they have been informed about thee, are nothing, but thou thyself also walk orderly, keeping the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And about the Gentiles who have believed, we sent word, having decided for them to keep no such thing, except for them to guard against what is sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Paul, having taken the men on the following day, having been purified with them, entered into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for each one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people and threw hands on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">crying out, Men, Israelites, help. This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place. And besides he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For they were men who saw Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed that Paul brought into the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the whole city was moved, and there developed a running together of the people. And having taken Paul they dragged him out of the temple, and straightaway the doors were shut.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And while seeking to kill him, a report went up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem has been stirred up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And immediately after taking soldiers and centurions, he ran down to them. And they, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the chief captain having come near, he seized him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains. And he inquired whoever he may be, and what it is he has been doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And some among the crowd shouted out one thing, some another. And not being able to know the certainty because of the uproar, he commanded him to be carried into the fort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And it came to pass when on the steps (it happened for him to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">for the mass of the people followed, crying out, Away with him),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">and as Paul was going to be brought into the fort, he says to the chief captain, Is it permitted for me to speak to thee? And he said, Thou know Greek?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then thou are not the Egyptian who revolted before these days, and who led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But Paul said, I am really a Jewish man of Tarsus of Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. And I beg thee, allow me to speak to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And having permitted him, Paul, having stood on the steps, motioned his hand to the people. And when a great hush developed, he called out in the Hebrew language, saying,</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Men, brothers, and fathers, hear now my defense to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And having heard that he called out to them in the Hebrew language, they offered more silence. And he says,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I am indeed a Jewish man, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but reared in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, reared accurately in the paternal law, being a zealot of God, as ye all are today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I persecuted this Way as far as death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As also the high priest testifies about me, and all the senior council, from whom also having received letters to the brothers in Damascus, I was going to bring bound even those who were there to Jerusalem so that they might be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there happened to me, while going and approaching Damascus about noon, suddenly to flash forth from heaven a great light around me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do thou persecute me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I answered, Who are thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom thou persecute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And those who were with me indeed saw the light and became afraid, but they heard not the voice of him who spoke to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, After rising, go into Damascus, and there it will be told thee about all things that have been assigned for thee to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as I was not seeing from the splendor of that light, I came into Damascus, being led by hand by those who accompanied me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report by all the Jews who dwell there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">having come near me, and having stood by, he said to me, Brother Saul, look up. And I looked up on him the same hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, The God of our fathers appointed thee to know his will, and to see the Righteous Man, and to hear a voice from his mouth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">because thou will be a witness for him to all men of the things that thou have seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And now what is it going to be? Having arisen, immerse and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, my having returned to Jerusalem and while I prayed in the temple, for me to became in a trance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I saw him saying to me, Hurry and depart in haste out of Jerusalem, because they will not accept thy testimony about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I said, Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue those who believe in thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I myself also was standing by, and approving his killing, and keeping the garments of those who killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said to me, Depart, because I will send thee far away to Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they heard him until this word. And they lifted up their voice, saying, Away with such a man from the earth, for he is not fit to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And of them crying out, and throwing off their garments, and casting dust into the air,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">the chief captain commanded him be brought into the fort, having said to examine him by scourging, so that he might know for what reason they shouted against him this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as they stretched him out with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, Is it permitted for you to scourge a Roman man, and uncondemned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the centurion heard, having come to the chief captain, he reported, saying, Look! What are thou about to do? For this man is a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the chief captain having come, he said to him, Tell me if thou are a Roman. And he said, Yes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the chief captain answered, Of a great sum I obtained this citizenship. And Paul said, But then I was born so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Straightaway therefore those who were about to examine him withdrew from him. And the chief captain was also afraid when he learned that he was a Roman, and because he was who bound him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But on the morrow, wanting to know the certainty of why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to come. And having brought Paul down, he set him before them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Paul, after looking intently at the council, said, Men, brothers, I have been a citizen in all good conscience to God until this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the high priest Ananias ordered those who stood by him to strike his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Paul said to him, God is going to smite thee, a whitewashed wall. Thou even sit judging me according to the law, and violating law, thou command me to be struck?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And those who stood by said, Thou revile God's high priest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Paul said, I had not known, brothers, that he is a high priest, for it is written, Thou shall not speak ill of a ruler of thy people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Paul ascertained that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, son of a Pharisee. About the hope and resurrection of the dead I am judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he said this, there developed a conflict of the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the group was divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For in fact Sadducees say to be no resurrection nor agent nor spirit, but Pharisees acknowledge them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there developed a great clamor. And some of the scholars of the Pharisees part having risen, they argued vehemently, saying, We find nothing wrong in this man. But if a spirit spoke to him, or an agent, we should not fight against God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a great conflict having developed, the chief captain, having been alarmed lest Paul might be torn apart by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from the midst of them, and bring him into the fort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the following night the Lord, having stood by him, said, Cheer up, Paul, for as thou have testified these things about me at Jerusalem, so thou must testify also at Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when it became day, some of the Jews, having made a conspiracy, put themselves under a curse, saying neither to eat nor to drink until they would kill Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there were more than forty who made this conspiracy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">who, having come near to the chief priests and the elders, said, We have put ourselves under a curse, a curse to taste of nothing until we would kill Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore ye with the council report to the chief captain that tomorrow he may bring him down to you, as though going to inquire more accurately the things about him. And we, before he comes near, are prepared to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But the son of Paul's sister, having heard of the ambush, having come and entered into the fort, he informed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Paul, having called one of the centurions, said, Take this young man to the chief captain, for he has something to inform him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Indeed therefore having taken him, he brought him to the chief captain, and says, Paul the prisoner, having called me, asked me to bring this young man to thee, who has something to say to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the chief captain having grasped his hand, and having gone in private, he asked him, What is it that thou have to inform me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee that tomorrow thou would bring Paul down to the council, as though going to inquire something more accurately about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore thou should not be persuaded by them, for more than forty men of them wait to ambush him, who have put themselves under an oath, neither to eat nor drink until they have killed him. And now they are ready, expecting the promise from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Indeed therefore the chief captain dismissed the young man, having ordered, Tell no man that thou have shown these things to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having summoned a certain two of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers that they may go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen at the third hour of the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And provide beasts, so that after mounting Paul, they may bring him safely to Felix the governor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">after writing a letter containing this form:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Claudius Lysias to the eminent governor Felix, greeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This man who was seized by the Jews, and was going to be killed by them, having stood by with the soldiers, I rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And wanting to know for what reason they accused him, I brought him down to their council,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">whom I found accusing about issues of their law, having not one accusation worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when it was reported to me of a plot going to be against the man by the Jews, I immediately sent him to thee, also having commanded the accusers to speak before thee the things against him. Be strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Indeed therefore, the soldiers, according to that which was precisely arranged for them, having taken Paul, they brought him through the night to Antipatris.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But on the morrow they returned to the fort, having allowed the horsemen to depart with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">who, after coming to Caesarea and having delivered the letter to the governor, also presented Paul to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the governor having read it, and having questioned from what province he was, and having found out that he was from Cilicia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">he said, I will hear thee when thine accusers also will arrive. And he commanded him to be kept in the Praetorium of Herod.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders, and a certain orator, Tertullus, who appeared to the governor against Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Experiencing much peace because of thee, and worthy deeds happening to this nation because of thy foresight,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">we welcome, both always and everywhere, eminent Felix, with all thankfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But, that I may not detain thee on more, I entreat thee in thy clemency to hear us briefly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we have found this man a plague, who even instigates sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who also attempted to profane the temple, whom also we took,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">[This verse is not in the majority of the Greek manuscripts.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">from whom thou will be able, having examined him, to learn about all these things of which we accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Jews also agreed, claiming to have these things this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when the governor gestured to him to speak, Paul answered, Knowing for many years thou being a judge to this nation, I gladly make a defense of these things about myself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">thou being able to learn that there are for me not more than twelve days from which I went up to worship in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they found me neither in the temple disputing against any man, nor making a gang of a group, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither can they prove against me of which things they now accuse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But this I confess to thee, that according to the Way that they call a sect, so serve I the paternal God, believing all things written according to the law and the prophets,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">having hope toward God, which they themselves also await, to come to be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And in this I fashion myself, having a conscience always non-stumbling before God and men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now after more years I came, going to make donations to my nation, and offerings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">during which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd or with a tumult,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who ought to be here before thee, and to accuse, if they would have anything against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Or let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found in me, having stood before the council,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">or about this one voice that I cried out standing among them: About a resurrection of the dead I am judged by you this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now Felix, having heard these things, having known more precisely the things about the Way, he deferred them, having said, When Lysias the chief captain comes down, I will determine the things toward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He also arranged for the centurion to guard Paul, and to have reduced confinement, and to forbid none of his own men to serve or to come to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And after some days, Felix having arrived with Drusilla, his wife being Jewish, he summoned Paul, and heard him about the faith in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as he discoursed about righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment going to be, Felix, having become afraid, answered, Go now, and having a convenient time, I will summon thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He also hoped simultaneously that money would be given him by Paul so that he might free him. And so, summoning him more frequently, he conversed with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But two years having been fulfilled, Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus. And wanting to lay down favors to the Jews, Felix left behind Paul bound.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Festus therefore having entered into the province, after three days he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the high priest and the principal men of the Jews appeared to him against Paul, and urged him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem, making an ambush to kill him on the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Indeed therefore Festus answered to keep Paul in Caesarea, and he himself was going to go out quickly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore he says, Let the able men among you, after coming down together, accuse him if there is anything in this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And after remaining among them more than ten days, having gone down to Caesarea, on the morrow having sat on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he arrived, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood around, bringing many and serious accusations against Paul, which they could not prove,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">while he was defending, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I transgressed anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Festus, wanting to lay down a favor to the Jews, having answered Paul, said, Are thou willing, after going up to Jerusalem, to be judged there about these things before me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Paul said, I am standing at the judgment seat of Caesar, where I ought to be judged. I did nothing wrong Jewish, as thou also very well know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if I am indeed wrong, and have done anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die, but if there is nothing of what these men accuse me, no man can give me to them freely. I appeal Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Festus, when he conferred with the council, answered, Thou have appealed Caesar, to Caesar thou will go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now some days having passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, greeting Festus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And as he was remaining there more days, Festus declared to the king the things concerning Paul, saying, There is a certain man who was left behind a prisoner by Felix,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">about whom, when I became in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews revealed, asking judgment against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To whom I answered, that it is not a custom by Romans to give any man freely for destruction, before the man being accused has the accusers in person, and receives an occasion of defense about the accusation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When therefore they assembled here, not having made one delay, next in order, having sat on the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">About whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought not one cause of what I supposed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but had certain issues against him about his own religion, and about a certain Jesus, who has died, whom Paul was claiming to be alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I, being uncertain of the controversy about this man, asked whether he wants to go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when Paul appealed to be kept for the decision of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept until I might send him to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Agrippa said to Festus, I also want to hear the man myself. And tomorrow, he says, thou will hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore on the morrow, Agrippa and Bernice having come with great pomp, and having entered into the courtroom, and with the chief captains and the men of prominence who were of the city, and Festus who commanded, Paul was brought in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Festus says, King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews appealed to me, both at Jerusalem and here, shouting he ought not to live any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I, having understood him to have done nothing worthy of death, and also him, this man, having appealed Augustus I decided to send him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">About whom I do not have anything certain to write to the lord. Therefore I brought him before you, and especially before thee, King Agrippa, so that, an examination having occurred, I may have something to write.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it seems to me unreasonable, sending a prisoner, and not to specify the causes against him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. Then Paul, having stretched forth his hand, made a defense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Concerning all things of which I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself blessed, being about to make my defense before thee today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Especially thee, being an expert of all things regarding Jews, both habits and issues. Therefore I beg thee to hear me patiently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Indeed therefore, my manner of life from youth, having developed from the beginning among my nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">having known me previously from the beginning, if they were willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now for the hope of the promise made by God to the fathers, I stand being judged,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">to which our twelve tribes, serving in earnestness night and day, hope to attain, about which hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Why is it judged incredible with you, if God raises the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Indeed therefore I thought it necessary for myself to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">which also I did at Jerusalem. And I locked up many of the sanctified in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests. And when they were killed, I gave a vote against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And punishing them often at all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme. And being extraordinarily furious toward them, I persecuted them even as far as to outside cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And during which, while going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">at midday, O king, I saw on the road a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, which shone around me and those who went with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when we all fell to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do thou persecute me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I said, Who are thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But arise, and stand upon thy feet, for I appeared to thee for this, to appoint thee an assistant and a witness both of things that thou saw, and of the things that I will make visible to thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">to open their eyes to turn about from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, for them to receive remission of sins and a lot among those who have been sanctified by faith in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Whereupon, King Agrippa, I did not become disobedient to the heavenly vision,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but declaring first to those at Damascus and then at Jerusalem, and in all the region of Judea, and to the Gentiles, to repent and return to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Because of these things the Jews, having seized me in the temple, tried to grasp and kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Having therefore experienced the help from God, I stand to this day solemnly declaring both to small and great, saying nothing apart from what both the prophets and Moses said was going to happen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">that the suffering Christ, since first from a resurrection of the dead, is going to proclaim light to our people and to the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And while he made a defense by these things, Festus said in a loud voice, Paul, thou are mad. Much scholarship is driving thee into madness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Paul says, I am not mad, eminent Festus, but I speak forth sayings of truth and soberness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For the king knows about these things, before whom I also speak boldly. For I am convinced not any of these things, nothing, to be hidden from him. For this was not done in a corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa, do thou believe the prophets? I know that thou believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Agrippa said to Paul, By a little thou persuade me to become a Christian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Paul said, I ever pray to God, both by little and by much, not only thee, but also all who hear me this day, to become such kind as I also am, apart from these bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when he spoke these things, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And having withdrawn, they spoke to each other, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been released, if he had not appealed Caesar.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when it was determined for us to sail for Italy, they delivered both Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the band of Augustus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And having gotten on a ship of Adramyttium that was going to sail to the places along Asia, we launched, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And on another day we put in at Sidon. And Julius, who treated Paul kindly, allowed him to undergo care, after going to his friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And having launched from there, we sailed under lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And having sailed across the depths along Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, of Lycia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there, the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, he put us in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And sailing slowly during considerable days, and with difficulty having come along the Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under lee of Crete, along Salmone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And sailing by it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near to which was Lasea City.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And considerable time having past, and the voyage now being dangerous, also because the Fast was now past, Paul urged,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">saying to them, Men, I perceive that the voyage is going to be with injury and much damage, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the centurion was convinced more by the captain and the shipmaster than to those things spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And since the haven was inconvenient to winter in, the majority gave counsel to launch from there also, if somehow they might be able, after arriving at Phoenix, to winter in a haven of Crete, looking toward southwest and northwest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when a south wind blew gently, having presumed to have obtained their purpose, after taking up anchor, they sailed very near by Crete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But not long after, there threw against it a cyclonic wind called the Euroclydon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the ship having been caught, and not being able to face the wind, having given up, we were driven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And having sailed under lee of a certain island called Clauda, we were able with difficulty, to develop control of the skiff.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And having taken that up, they used helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they might fall off into the sandbank, having lowered the vessel, they were driven this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And since we were exceedingly storm-tossed, on the next day they jettisoned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the third day we cast out by hands the tackling of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when neither sun nor stars appeared for more days, and no small storm laying on, all remaining hope for us to be saved was taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And being long without food, then Paul, who stood in the midst of them, said, Ye truly ought, O men, to have complied with me, not to launch from Crete, and gain this damage and loss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will not be one loss of life from you, except of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For there stood by me this night an agent of the God whose I am, whom also I serve,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">saying, Fear not, Paul. Thou must stand before Caesar, and lo, God has granted thee all those sailing with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore men, cheer up, for I believe God, that it will be so in that way it has been told to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But we must fall off upon a certain island.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when it became the fourteenth night, as we were driven about in the Adriatic sea, toward midnight the sailors suspected some region to come near them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And having tossed lead, they found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther, and having tossed lead again, they found fifteen fathoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And fearing lest somehow we might falloff on rough places, having cast off four anchors from the stern, they prayed for day to develop.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And since the sailors sought to flee out of the ship, and having lowered the skiff into the sea in pretense as going to stretch out anchors from the bow,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff, and let it fall off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And until day was going to develop, Paul urged them all to partake of food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day, waiting, ye continue without food, having taken nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Therefore I encourage you to take of food, for this is for your safety. For not a hair will fall from the head of one of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And having said these things, and having taken bread, he expressed thanks to God in the presence of all. And having broke in pieces, he began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And they all, having become encouraged, also took food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And all the souls in the ship were two hundred seventy-six.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And after being filled of food, they unloaded the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when it became day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay having a beach, onto which, they decided if possible, to drive the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And having cast off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time unfastening the bands of the rudders. And having hoisted up the foresail to the wind, they held firm for the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And having chanced upon a place where two seas meet, they ran the ship aground. And of course, the bow having become stuck, it remained immovable, but the stern was coming apart by the force of the waves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And a decision of the soldiers developed that they should kill the prisoners, lest any man, having swam away, might escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, prevented them from their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim, having first jumped out, to go to the land,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and the remaining, some on boards, and some on any of the things from the ship. And so it came to pass for all to be saved to the land.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after being saved, then they learned that the island was called Malta.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the foreigners presented uncommon kindness to us, for, having kindled a fire, they received us all because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Paul having gathered a quantity of sticks, and having placed them on the fire, a viper having come out from the heat, it fastened on his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to each other, Certainly this man is a murderer, whom, though saved from the sea, Justice did not allow to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Indeed therefore having shaken off the creature into the fire, he experienced nothing harmful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But they expected he was going to swell up, or suddenly fall down dead, but when they were long expecting, and seeing nothing amiss happening to him, thinking differently, they declared him to be a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now among the things around that place were fields of the chief of the island, named Publius, who, having received us kindly, lodged us three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came about for the father of Publius to be laid down, gripped by fever and dysentery, to whom Paul, having entered in, and having prayed, having laid his hands on him, healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore when this happened, the others also who had infirmities on the island came and were healed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">who also honored us with many honorariums. And while putting out to sea, they furnished the things for our necessities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And after three months we set out in a ship that wintered at the island, an Alexandrian with The Twin Brothers emblem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And after being brought down to Syracuse, we remained there three days,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">from where having made a circuit, we arrived at Rhegium. And after one day, wind from the south having developed, we came a second day to Puteoli,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">where, having found brothers, we were invited to stay with them seven days. And so we went toward Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And from there the brothers, who heard these things about us, came for a meeting with us as far as Appius Forum and The Three Taverns, whom, when Paul saw, having expressed thanks to God, he took courage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the commandant, but Paul was allowed to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass after three days, for Paul to call together those who were the principle men of the Jews. And when they came together, he said to them, Men, brothers, I, having done nothing against the people, or the paternal customs, I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">who, after examining me, wanted to release me, because there was not one cause of death in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal Caesar, not as having anything to accuse my nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Because of this reason therefore I summoned you to see and to speak with me, for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they said to him, We neither received letters from Judea about thee, nor did any of the brothers who came report or speak anything bad about thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But we think it worthy to hear from thee what thou think. For indeed about this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having appointed a day for him, more came to him into his lodging, to whom he expounded, solemnly testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them of the things about Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning until evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And some were convinced by the things that were spoken, and some disbelieved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And being discord among each other, they departed after Paul spoke one thing, saying, Well spoke the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">saying, Go thou to this people, and say, Hearing ye will hear, and will, no, not understand, and seeing ye will see, and will, no, not perceive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For this people's heart was made fat, and they hear heavily with the ears. And they shut their eyes, lest they may perceive with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should turn, and I would heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Be it known to you therefore, that the salvation of God was sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when he said these things, the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired lodging. And he received all who came in to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, a bondman of Jesus Christ, a called apostle having been separated for the good news of God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(which he fore-promised through his prophets in the holy scriptures)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">concerning his Son who was made from the seed of David according to flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He who was designated Son of God in power, according to a spirit of holiness, from a resurrection of the dead-Jesus Christ our Lord-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">through whom we received grace and apostleship for obedience of faith among all the nations on behalf of his name,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">among which ye also are the called of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, to the called, to the sanctified: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">First, I indeed express thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For God is my witness whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">pleading, if somehow now at last I will have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I long to see you, so that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, in order to establish you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and that is, to be mutually encouraged among you through each other's faith, both yours and mine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that I often intended to come to you (and was prevented until now), so that I might have some fruit also among you, even as among the other Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am debtor both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the willingness is in me to preach the good news also to you in Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For I am not ashamed of the good news of Christ, for it is the power of God for salvation to every man who believes, both to the Jew first, and to the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith for faith, just as it is written, And the righteous man will live from faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all irreverence and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">because what is knowable of God is apparent in them, for God made it known to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things made, both his eternal power and divinity, for them to be without excuse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Because, although knowing God, they did not glorify him as God, nor were they thankful, but became vain in their reasonings and their heart was darkened without understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Professing to be wise, they became foolish,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image like corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed things, and creeping things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And for this reason God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, to degrade their bodies among themselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">who changed the truth of God into the lie, and worshiped and served the creation against him who created it, who is blessed into the ages. Truly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Because of this God gave them up to shameful passions, for even their females changed the natural use into what is against nature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And likewise also the males, having left the natural use of the female, burned in their lust toward each other, males with males producing shamelessness, and receiving in themselves the recompense of their deviancy that was fitting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And just as they did not approve having God in knowledge, God gave them over to an unfit mind, to do things that are not fit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">having been filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">being gossips, slanderous, God-hating, aggressors, arrogant boasters, contrivers of evil things, disobedient to parents;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">without understanding, untrustworthy, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Who, knowing the righteousness of God, that those who commit such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also favor those who do.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, O man, thou are without excuse, every man who judges, for in what thou judge the other man, thou condemn thyself, for the man who judges is doing the same things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And we know that the judgment of God is in accordance with truth against those who commit such things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And think thou this, O man who judge those who do such things and do the same, that thou will escape the judgment of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Or do thou despise the wealth of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God guides thee to repentance?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But according to thy hardness, and thy impenitent heart, thou store up wrath to thyself in the day of wrath, and revelation, and righteous judgment of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who will render to each man according to his works,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">to those who indeed seek by perseverance of good work, glory and esteem and immortality-eternal life-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but to those of self-interest, and who indeed disobey the truth but have confidence in unrighteousness-anger and wrath,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">pressure and restriction, upon every soul of man who produces evil, both of the Jew first, and of the Greek,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">but glory and esteem and peace to every man who works good, both to the Jew first, and to the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For there is no partiality with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For as many as have sinned without law will also be destroyed without law, and as many as have sinned in law will be judged by law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For the hearers of the law are not righteous with God, but the doers of the law will be made righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For when the Gentiles who have no law do by nature the things of the law, these men, not having law, are a law to themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, testifying of their conscience, and their thoughts amidst each other accusing or also defending them</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">in a day when God judges the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Behold, thou are called a Jew, and rely upon the law, and boast in God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and know his will, and approve the things that are significant, being instructed out of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And thou have confidence in thyself to be a guide of the blind, a light of those in darkness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the childlike, having in the law the essence of knowledge and truth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">thou therefore who teach another, do thou not teach thyself? Thou who preach not to steal, do thou steal?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Thou who say not to commit adultery, do thou commit adultery? Thou who abhor idols, do thou rob temples?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Thou who boast in law, dishonor God by thy transgression of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, just as it is written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For circumcision is indeed beneficial if thou perform law, but if thou are a transgressor of law, thy circumcision has become uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If therefore a man of uncircumcision keeps the ordinances of the law, will not his uncircumcision be considered circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the man of natural uncircumcision who fulfills the law, will judge thee, a transgressor of law through a document and circumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he is not a Jew in what is visible, nor is circumcision in what is visible, in flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">but he is a Jew in what is hidden, and circumcision is of the heart, in spirit not a document, whose praise is not from men but from God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What then is the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Much every way. First, because they were indeed entrusted with the oracles of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief make the assurance of God ineffective?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">May it not happen! But let it come to pass God is true, but every man a liar, as it is written, That thou may ever be justified in thy words, and may prevail when thou are criticized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous inflicting wrath? (I speak according to a man.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">May it not happen! Otherwise how will God judge the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if by my lie, the truth of God abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as sinful,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and not (as we are slandered, and as some affirm us to say) that we may do evil so that good things may come (whose condemnation is just)?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What then? Are we better? Not at all. For we already charged both Jews and Greeks to all be under sin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">as it is written, There is no righteous man, not even one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is no man who understands. There is no man who seeks God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All turned away. Together they became useless. There is not a man who does goodness; there is not as much as one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Their throat is an open grave. With their tongues they deceive. The poison of asps is under their lips,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Their feet are swift to shed blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Destruction and misery are in their ways,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and the way of peace they have not known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now we know that as many things as the law says, it says to those in the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become accountable to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Because from works of law no flesh will be made right before him, for through law is knowledge of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But now a righteousness of God has been manifested independent of law, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ is for all and upon all those who believe, for there is no distinction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">being made righteous freely by his grace, through the redemption in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">whom God set forth an expiatory sacrifice through faith in his blood, for proof of his justice, because of the passing over of the sins that have formerly occurred</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">(in the forbearance of God), for proof of his justice at the present time, for him to be righteous, and who makes the man from Jesus' faith righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what law, of works? No, but by a law of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">We therefore consider a man to be made righteous by faith independent of works of law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Or is God of Jews only and not also of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles also,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">since God is one, who will make the man of circumcision righteous from faith, and the man of uncircumcision through faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Do we then make law void through faith? May it not happen! Instead, we establish law.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What then will we say Abraham, our father according to flesh, to have found?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if Abraham was made righteous from works, he has a boast, but not before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what does the scripture say? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now to the man being employed, the wage is not reckoned according to grace, but according to obligation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But to the man not being employed, but who believes in him who makes the impious man righteous, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Blessed is a man to whom the Lord does, no, not impute sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Is this blessedness therefore upon men of circumcision, or also upon men of uncircumcision? For we say, Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">How then was it reckoned? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he received the sign of circumcision, as a seal of the righteousness of his faith during uncircumcision, for him to be father of all those who believe during uncircumcision (for righteousness to also be imputed to them),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and father of those of circumcision, to those not only of circumcision, but also to those who march in the steps of faith-of that during the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For the promise to Abraham or to his seed, for him to be heir of the world, was not through law, but through a righteousness of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if those from law are heirs, faith has been made void, and the promise has been made useless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For the law works wrath. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Because of this it is from faith, so that it is according to grace, in order for the promise to be sure to all the seed, not only to the seed from the law, but also to the seed from the faith of Abraham, who is father of us all</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">(as it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations), before him whom he believed, of God who makes the dead alive, and who calls things not existing, as existing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Who, against hope, believed in hope, in order for him to become father of many nations according to that which was spoken, So thy seed will be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And not being weak in faith he did not regard his body, which was now deadened (being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he did not waver in unbelief at the promise of God, but became strong in faith, giving glory to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and being fully assured that what he promised, he was able also to perform.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And therefore it was reckoned to him for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now it was not written because of him alone that it was imputed to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but also because of us to whom it is going to be imputed, to those who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">who was delivered up for our offenses, and was raised up for our justification.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore having been made righteous from faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">through whom also we have access by faith for this grace in which we stand, and we take pride in hope of the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And not only so, but we also take pride in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and perseverance, character, and character, hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit that was given to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For while we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the impious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For scarcely for a righteous man will some man die, indeed perhaps for the good man some man would even dare to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But God commends his love toward us, that, while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Much more then, now having been made righteous by his blood, we will be saved from the wrath through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if, while being enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more having been reconciled we will be saved by his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And not only so, but also taking pride in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Because of this, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, so also death passed to all men, in that all sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For until law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a type of the coming man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But in this way also, the gift is not as the transgression. For if by the trespass of the one man the many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift in grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abounded for the many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the gift is not as through one man who sinned, for indeed the judgment from one man was for condemnation, but the gift from many offenses is for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For if, by the offense of the one man, death reigned through the one man, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So then, as through an offense of one man was for condemnation for all men, so also through a righteousness of one man was for justification of life for all men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For as through the one man's disobedience the many were led sinful, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be led righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the law entered so that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace was more abundant,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">so that, as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign, through righteousness, for eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What will we say then? We continue in sin so that grace may abound?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">May it not happen! How will we who died to sin, still live in it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Or are ye ignorant that as many as were immersed into Christ Jesus were immersed into his death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We were buried therefore with him through the immersion into death, so that as Christ was raised up from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we may walk in newness of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For if we have become co-planted in the likeness of his death, then we will also be of the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, so that the body of sin might be inactivated, no longer to enslave us to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For he who has died has been made righteous away from sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no more has dominion over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For that he died, he died to sin once, but that he lives, he lives to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So also ye, reckon yourselves to be indeed dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body in order to obey it, in its lusts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And do not present your body-parts as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God, as living out of the dead, and your body-parts as instruments of righteousness to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">for sin will not have dominion over you. For ye are not under law, but under grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What then? May we sin, because we are not under law but under grace? May it not happen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Know ye not, that to what ye present yourselves as bondmen for obedience, ye are bondmen to what ye obey, whether of sin for death, or of obedience for righteousness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But thanks to God, that ye were bondmen of sin, but ye obeyed from the heart a model of doctrine for which ye were delivered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And having been set free from sin, ye were made servile to righteousness</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(I speak man-like because of the weakness of your flesh). For as ye presented your body-parts servile to uncleanness, and to lawlessness for lawlessness, so now present your body-parts servile to righteousness for sanctification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For when ye were bondmen of sin, ye were uninhibited by righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">What fruit therefore did ye have then, of which things ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But now having been made free from sin, and having become servile to God, ye have your fruit for sanctification, and the end, eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Or are ye ignorant, brothers (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over the man for as long a time as he lives?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the woman under authority to the living husband has been bound by law, but if the husband should die, she has been released from the law of the husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So then, of the living husband, she will be called an adulteress if she becomes to another man, but if the husband should die, she is free from the law, for her not to be an adulteress having become to another man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore, my brothers, ye also became dead to the law through the body of Christ in order for ye to become to another, to him who was raised from the dead, so that we would bear fruit to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For when we were in the flesh, the passions of the sins were working in our body-parts (through the law) in order to bear fruit to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now we have been released from the law, having died to what we were held, so as for us to serve in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of a document.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What will we say then? The law is sin? May it not happen! Yet I did not know sin except through law. For likewise I would not have known lust, if the law did not say, Thou shall not covet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But sin, having taken opportunity through the commandment, wrought in me every evil desire, for apart from law sin is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I was alive once apart from law, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I found to me, the commandment being for life, this is for death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For sin, having taken opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the law is indeed holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Has therefore what is good become death to me? May it not happen! Instead, it is sin, so that it might be revealed, sin working death in me through what is good, so that through the commandment sin might become sinful to extreme.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, having been sold under sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For I do not understand what I do, for I do not do this that I want, but what I hate, this I do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if I do this that I do not want, I agree with the law that it is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But now I no longer perform it, but the sin dwelling in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I know that good does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh, for to will is present in me, but to do the good, I find not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I do not do good that I want, instead, wrong that I do not want, this I do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But if I do this that I do not want, I no longer perform it, but sin dwelling in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Consequently I find the law in my wanting to do good, that evil is present in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but I see a different law in my body-parts, warring against the law of my mind, and taking me captive in the law of sin, which is in my body-parts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I am a wretched man. Who will rescue me out of the body of this death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then, I of myself in the mind indeed serve a law of God, but in the flesh a law of sin.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Consequently nothing is condemnation now to those in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to flesh but according to Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus freed me from the law of sin and of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the impotence of the law, in that it was weak because of the flesh, God, having sent his own Son in a form of flesh of sin, and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">so that the justice of the law might be fulfilled in us, those who walk not according to flesh, but according to Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For those who are according to flesh think about the things of the flesh, but those according to Spirit the things of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the mentality of the flesh is death, but the mentality of the Spirit is life and peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Because the mentality of the flesh is enmity against God, for it is not submissive to the law of God, for neither is it able.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And those who are in flesh cannot please God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But ye are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any man does not have the Spirit of Christ, this man is not of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And if Christ is in you, the body is indeed dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up the Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwells in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh to live according to flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if ye live according to flesh, ye are going to die, but if in spirit ye kill the deeds of the body, ye will live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For ye did not receive a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The Spirit itself testifies with our spirit, that we are children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if children, also heirs, heirs indeed of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer jointly, so that we may also be glorified jointly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not comparable to the glory that is going to be revealed for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the eager expectation of the creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the creation was made subject to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it in hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Because the creation itself will also be freed from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For we know that the whole creation is groaning and travailing together until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And not only so, but also ourselves who have the first fruit of the Spirit. And we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For we were saved to hope. But hope that is seen is not hope. For what is seen, why also hope for that?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait through patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And likewise also the Spirit helps our weaknesses, for we know not what we would pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he who searches the hearts knows what is the mentality of the Spirit, because he appeals to God for the sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, who are the called according to purpose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Because whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be of similar nature of the form of his Son, in order for him to be the firstborn son among many brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And whom he predestined, these he also called, and whom he called, these he also made righteous, and whom he made righteous, these he also glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">What then will we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He who did not even spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how will he not also give us all things with him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who will accuse against the chosen of God? God is he who makes righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Who is he who will condemn? It is Christ who died, but more, who also was raised up, who also is at the right hand of God, who also appeals for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or restriction, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Just as it is written, For thy sake we are killed the whole day long. We are considered as sheep of slaughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor agents, nor principal positions, nor powers, nor things that have come, nor things that are coming,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">nor height, nor depth, nor any other creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And if it is by grace, it is no longer from works, otherwise grace becomes no longer grace. But if it is from works it is no longer grace, otherwise work is no longer work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What then? What Israel seeks, this it did not obtain. But the chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">just as it is written that God gave them a spirit of slumber: eyes not to see, and ears not to hear, until this very day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">I say then, did they stumble so that they would fall? May it not happen! But in their transgression, salvation is to the Gentiles, in order to provoke them to jealousy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now if their transgression is wealth of the world, and their failure is wealth of Gentiles, how much more their fullness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I speak to you the Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am indeed an apostle of Gentiles, I enhance my ministry,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">if somehow I may provoke my flesh to jealousy and may save some of them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and became a joint partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive tree,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">do not boast against the branches. But if thou boast, thou do not bear the root, but the root thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Thou will therefore say, Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Correct! They were broken off for their unbelief, and thou stand by thy faith. Be not high-minded but fear,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">for if God spared not the natural branches, perhaps neither will he spare thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Behold therefore the goodness and the severity of God. Indeed toward those who fell, severity, but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness, otherwise thou too will be cut off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And also those, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For if thou were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural ones, be grafted into their own olive tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For I do not want you, brothers, to be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise according to yourselves, that a callousness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles come in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The man who delivers will come from Zion, and will turn away impiety from Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And this is the covenant from me to them when I will take away their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They are indeed enemies toward the good news for your sake, but toward selection, they are beloved for the fathers' sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For as ye once were also disobedient to God, but now have received mercy at the disobedience of these,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">so also now these have been disobedient for thy mercy, so that they also may receive mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For God has confined all men in disobedience, so that he might be merciful to all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">O the depth of wealth, both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond finding out!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who became his counselor?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Or who first gave to him, and it will be repaid to him?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">But as it is written, What an eye has not seen, and an ear has not heard, and have not arisen in a heart of a man, are things that God prepared for those who love him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But God disclosed it to us through his Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For what man knows the things of the man, except the spirit of the man in him? And so nobody knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit from God, so that we might know the things graciously given to us by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Which things also we speak, not in things learned from mankind, in words of wisdom, but in things learned from the Holy Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he is unable to understand because they are evaluated spiritually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But truly the spiritual man evaluates all things, but he himself is evaluated by none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For who has known the mind of the Lord that he will stand with him? But we have the mind of Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now concerning the things of which ye wrote to me. It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let the husband render the goodwill owed to the wife, and likewise also the wife to the husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The wife has not the right of her private body, but the husband, and likewise also the husband has not the right of his private body, but the wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Do not defraud each other except from agreement for a time, so that ye may have time for fasting and prayer. And come together again for the same thing, so that Satan not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I say this from concession not from commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For I wish all men to be even as myself. However each man has his own gift from God, one in this way, and another after that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if they have no self-control they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And to those who are married, I do not command but the Lord. The wife is not to separate from her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But even if she separates, she shall remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to leave his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But to the rest I say, not the Lord. If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and this woman consents to dwell with him, he should not leave her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And whichever woman has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to dwell with her, she should not leave him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified by the husband, then otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if the unbeliever separates, he shall separate. The brother or the sister has not been bound in such things. And God has called us to peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For how do thou know, O wife, whether thou will save thy husband? Or how will thou know, O husband, whether thou will save thy wife?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Was any man called circumcised? He should not become uncircumcised. Was any man called in uncircumcision? He should not be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, instead, the keeping of God's commandments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Each man, in the situation in which he was called, in this he should remain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Were thou called being a bondman? It should not concern thee. However if also thou are able to become free, take advantage of it instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For he who was called in the Lord a bondman is a freedman of the Lord. Likewise also he who was called a free man is a bondman of Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Now concerning the virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give an opinion, as having obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I suppose therefore this to be good because of the present distress, that it is good for a man to be this way:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Are thou bound to a wife? Do not seek separation. Are thou free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But also if thou did marry thou have not sinned, and if the virgin married she has not sinned. Yet such kind will have stress in the flesh, but I spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But this I say, brothers, the time is shortened. It is the remaining, so that also those who have wives may be as not having,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and those who weep, as not weeping, and those who rejoice, as not rejoicing, and those who buy, as not possessing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and those who use this world, as not making full use, for the form of this world passes away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But I want you to be without worry. The unmarried man cares for things of the Lord, how he will please the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But he who is married cares for things of the world, how he will please his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the wife and the virgin are differentiated. The unmarried woman is concerned for the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married is concerned for the things of the world, how she will please her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And I say this for your own benefit, not that I may cast restraint upon you, but for what is respectable and assiduous toward the Lord, undistracted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But if any man thinks to behave improperly toward his virgin, if it is past the best time, and so ought to happen, she should do what she wants, she does not sin, they should marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he who stands firm in his heart, not having necessity, but has power based upon his own will, and has decided this in his heart, to keep his own celibacy, does well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And therefore he who gives in marriage does well, but he who does not give in marriage does better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">A wife is bound by law as long a time as her husband lives, but also if the husband should sleep, she is free to be married to whom she desires, only in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But she is more blessed if she remains this way according to my opinion. And I also seem to have Spirit of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But if any man loves God, this man is known by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore about eating the things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Nevertheless the knowledge is not in all men, but some, with conscience of the idol until now, eat as sacrificed to idols, and their weak conscience is defiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But food does not present us to God, for neither if we eat are we ahead, nor if we do not eat are we behind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But take heed lest somehow this privilege of yours becomes a stumbling-block to those who are weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if some man sees thee, who has knowledge, dining in an idol-temple, will not his conscience, being weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And by thy knowledge the brother, being weak, will be ruined, for whom Christ died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And sinning this way against the brothers, and wounding their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Look at Israel according to flesh. Those who eat the sacrifices, are they not partakers of the altar?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">What therefore do I say, that an idol is anything, or that a sacrifice to an idol is anything?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Rather, that which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to become partakers of demons.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Every man praying or prophesying having something upon his head dishonors his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for it is one and the same thing as the woman who has been shaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">When therefore ye come together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And there are varieties of functions, but it is the same God who works all in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each man toward that which is beneficial.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee, nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Instead, much more the parts of the body that seem to be more feeble are necessary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And those things of the body presumed to be without esteem, we place around these more abundant worth. And our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And if one part suffers, all the parts suffer together, or one part is honored, all the parts rejoice together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now ye are the body of Christ, and body-parts individually.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Pursue love, and be zealous for the spiritual things, but more that ye may prophesy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For he who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men, but to God, for no man hears, but in spirit he speaks mysteries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But he who prophesies speaks to men edification and encouragement and comfort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but he who prophesies builds up the congregation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but more that ye may prophesy. For greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the congregation may receive edification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I benefit you, unless I would speak to you either in a revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophesying, or in doctrine?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Likewise lifeless things that give a sound, whether flute or harp, if they give no distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is being piped or harped?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">So also ye, unless ye give understandable speech by the tongue, how will that which is spoken be known? For ye will be talking into the air.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">I thank my God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">What is it therefore, brothers? When ye come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">If any man speaks in a tongue, be according to two, or at the most three, and in succession. And let one interpret.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">But now Christ has been raised from the dead. He became the first fruit of those who are asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For since death is because of a man, the resurrection of the dead is also because of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For as by Adam all die, so also by Christ all will be made alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But each in his own order. Christ the first fruit, then those of Christ at his coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Afterwards the end, when he delivers up the kingdom to the God and Father, when he will abolish all rule, and all authority and power.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Upon the first day of the week let each of you set something aside near himself, storing up whatever he may prosper, so that when I come no collections may be made then.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when I arrive, whomever ye may approve by letters, I will send these men to bring your gift to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And if it is fitting for me to go also, they will go with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia, for I do pass through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it may be that I will remain with you, or I will even spend winter, so that ye may set me on my way wherever I go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For I do not want to see you now in passing, but I hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord allows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I will remain at Ephesus until Pentecost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For a great and effective door has opened to me, and yet there are many who are hostile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if Timothy comes, see that he becomes without fear with you, for he works the work of the Lord, as I also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let not any man therefore disparage him, but send him forth in peace, so that he may come to me, for I expect him with the brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And about Apollos the brother, I urged him much that he would come to you with the brothers, and it was not at all his will that he should come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Watch ye, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let all things of you be done in love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now I beseech you, brothers (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruit of Achaia, and that they committed themselves to service for the sanctified),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">that ye also be subject to such men, and to every man working together and laboring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because these men filled your lack.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the congregation of God that is at Corinth, with all the sanctified who are in the whole of Achaia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all encouragement,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who encourages us in all our affliction, in order for us to be able to encourage those in every affliction, through the encouragement of which we ourselves are encouraged by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Because, as the sufferings of the Christ abound to us, so also our encouragement abounds through the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But whether we are oppressed, it is for your encouragement and salvation, which works by endurance from the same sufferings that we also experience (and our hope for you is steadfast), or we are encouraged, it is for your encouragement and salvation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">knowing that, as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the encouragement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about our affliction that happened to us in Asia, because we were extraordinarily weighed down, above strength, so as for us to despair even to be alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we ourselves have had the sentence of death in ourselves, so that we should not be trusting in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Who rescued us out of so great a death, and does rescue, in whom we have hoped that he will also still rescue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And of you who help together by supplication for us (a gift for us from many persons, because of many), so that there may be gratitude about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For our pride is this (the testimony from our conscience), that we behave in the world in the simplicity and purity of God, not by fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, and especially toward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For we write no other thing to you, but rather what ye read or also acknowledge. And I hope ye will also acknowledge until the end,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">as also ye did acknowledge us in part, because we are your boast, just as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And in this confidence I intended to come to you earlier, so that ye might have a second benefit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and to pass through you into Macedonia, and to come again from Macedonia to you, and by you to be helped on the way toward Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore intending this, did I accordingly employ anything in lightness? Or what I decide, do I decide according to flesh, so that it would be with me the yes, yes and the no, no?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But God is faithful, because our word toward you became not, yes and no.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was proclaimed among you by us (by me and Silvanus and Timothy) became not, yes and no, but in him has become, yes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For as many as be promises of God, in him is the Yes, and in him the Truly, for glory to God through us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and who anointed us, is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He also is who put a seal on us, and who gave the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that I did not yet come to Corinth, sparing you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Not because we lord over your faith, but are co-workmen of your joy, for by faith ye stand.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But I determined this in myself, not to come again to you in sadness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if I make you sad, who then is he who makes me glad except he who is made sad by me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I wrote this same thing to you, so that when I came, I would not have sadness from whom I ought to rejoice, having been confident toward you all, because my joy is of all of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For out of much stress and dismay of heart, through many tears, I wrote to you, not that ye would be grieved, but that ye might know the love that I have so much more for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if any man has caused sadness, he has not caused me sadness, but in part (that I may not bear down) you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sufficient to such a man is this punishment by the many,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that instead, for you rather to forgive and encourage, lest perhaps such a man would be swallowed up with too much sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore I beseech you to affirm love for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For I also wrote for this, so that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But to whom ye forgive anything, I too. For I also, whom I have forgiven (if anything), I have forgiven because of you in the presence of Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">so that we may not be exploited by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his methods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now having come to Troas for the good news of the Christ, and a door having been opened to me in the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I had no rest in my spirit, my not finding Titus my brother. But having departed from them, I went forth into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And thanks is to God who always causes us to triumph in the Christ, and who makes manifest the aroma of the knowledge of him in every place, through us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Because we are a fragrance of Christ to God, in those being saved and in those perishing:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to the one an odor of death for death, and to the other an aroma of life for life. And who is adequate for these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For we are not as other men, huckstering the word of God, but as from purity. But we speak in Christ as from God in the sight of God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Unless we need, as some men, commendatory letters to you or commendatory from you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ye are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">being seen that ye are a letter of Christ, administered by us, written not in ink, but in the Spirit of the living God, not in stony tablets, but in fleshly tablets, in hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And we have such confidence toward God through Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">not that we are sufficient of ourselves to reckon anything as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who also made us qualified helpers of a new covenant, not of a document, but of a Spirit, for the document kills but the Spirit makes alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if the administration of death in writings engraved on stones occurred in glory, so that the sons of Israel could not gaze upon the face of Moses because of the fading glory of his countenance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">how will the administration of the Spirit not be more in glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if the administration of condemnation has glory, the administration of righteousness excels much more in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For also that which has been glorified, has not been glorified in this regard, because of the glory that transcends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if that which is abolished was through glory, much more that which remains is in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Having therefore such a hope we use great boldness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and are not as Moses. He put a veil over his face in order for the sons of Israel not to gaze on the end of the fading.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But their minds were hardened, for to this day the same veil remains at the reading of the old testament, not being uncovered, which thing is abolished in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But to this day when Moses is read, a veil lies upon their heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But whenever it turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But we all, with unveiled face seeing by reflection the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same likeness from glory to glory, just as from the Spirit of the Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Because of this (having this ministry), in as much as we received mercy, we do not become discouraged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But we have renounced the covert things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor misrepresenting the word of God, but by the disclosure of the truth, commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But even if our good news is concealed, it is concealed in those who are perishing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">in whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, in order for the light of the good news of the glory of the Christ (who is a likeness of God) not to shine forth to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves are your bondmen through Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Because it is God who said, Out of darkness light is to shine, who shone in our hearts for an enlightenment of the knowledge of the glory of God in the presence of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the excellence of the power may be of God and not from us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">restricted in everything, yet not confined, perplexed but not despairing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Always carrying around in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, so that also the life of Jesus may be made visible in our body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For we who live are always given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that also the life of Jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So death indeed works in us, but life in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke, we also believe, and therefore we speak,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up through Jesus, and will present us with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace, which has multiplied because of the thankfulness of the many, may abound for the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore we are not discouraged, but even if the outer man of us is perishing, yet the inner man is renewed day by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For our slight momentary affliction works for us an eternal weight of glory from extraordinariness to extraordinariness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">while we look not at things seen, but at things not seen. For things seen are temporal, but things not seen are eternal.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For we know that if the earthly house of our tent were destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by hands, eternal in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For also in this we groan, longing to clothe ourselves with our habitation from heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">if indeed also having put it on we will not be found naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For also those who are in the tent groan, being burdened, not in that we want to undress, but to clothe ourselves, so that the mortal may be swallowed up by the life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now he who wrought us for this same thing is God, who also gave us the pledge of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore always being confident, and knowing that while at home in the body we are absent from the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">for we walk by faith, not by sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And we are confident, and are pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be at home near the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore also we aspire, whether at home or away from home, to be well-pleasing to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of the Christ, so that each man may receive back about the things that he did through the body, whether good or bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Having seen therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men. But we have been manifested to God, and I hope also to have been manifested in your consciences.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For we are not commending ourselves again to you, but giving you an opportunity of boasting about us, so that ye may have for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For whether we are beside ourselves to God, or we are of normal mind, it is for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the love of Christ holds us together, having judge this, that if one died for all, then all died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he died for all so that those who live would no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them, and was raised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So that henceforth we know no man according to flesh, and even if we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him no longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So then if any man is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away, behold, all things have become new.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And all things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and who gave to us the ministry of reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">How that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We are therefore, ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were calling through us. We plead on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the man who knew no sin was made sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And working jointly, we urge you also not to receive the grace of God in vain</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(for he says, At an acceptable time I heard thee, and in a day of salvation I helped thee. Behold, now is an acceptable time. Behold, now is a day of salvation),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">giving not one cause of stumbling in anything, so that the ministry may not be criticized,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but in everything commending ourselves as helpers of God, in much perseverance, in afflictions, in necessities, in restrictions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hungerings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">in purity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in non-hypocritical love,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">in word of truth, in power of God, through the weapons of righteousness of the right hand and of the left,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">through glory and disrepute, through slander and commendation; as deceitful, and yet true;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not put to death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">as grieving, but always rejoicing; as poor, but making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">O Corinthians, our mouth has been opened to you, our heart has been enlarged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Ye are not limited in us, but ye are limited in your bowels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But I speak the same recompense as to children, be ye also enlarged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Do not become unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what partnership has righteousness and lawlessness? And what fellowship has light with darkness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And what agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what share have believers with non-believers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And what mutual agreement has a temple of God with idols? For ye are a temple of the living God, just as God said, I will dwell in them, and will walk among them. And I will be their God, and they will be a people to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore, Come ye out from among them, and be ye separated, says the Lord, And touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and will be for a Father to you, and ye will be for sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in fear of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Make room for us. We wronged no man, we corrupted no man, we exploited no man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I speak not for condemnation, for I have said before that ye are in our hearts to die together and to live together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Great is my boldness toward you, great is my pride for you. I have been filled with encouragement. I over-abound with joy in all our affliction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had not one relief, but being oppressed in everything: battles outside, fears within.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Nevertheless God, who encourages the lowly, encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And not only by his presence, but also by the encouragement with which he was encouraged by you, reporting to us your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Because even though I grieved you in the letter, I am not remorseful (even though I was remorseful), for I perceive that that letter grieved you, even though for an hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now I rejoice, not that ye were grieved, but that ye were grieved for repentance. For ye were grieved toward God, so that ye might suffer loss from us in nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For sorrow toward God works repentance for salvation without regret, but the sorrow of the world works death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For behold this same thing-your grieving toward God. How much eagerness it worked in you, even a defense, even indignation, even fear, even longing, even zeal, even vengeance! In everything ye demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And so then, although I wrote to you, it was not because of the man who did wrong, nor because of the man who was wronged, but in order to reveal to you your eagerness for us in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Because of this we have been encouraged. And from your encouragement, we rejoiced to a greater degree more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Because, if I have boasted anything to him about you, I am not ashamed, but as we spoke all things in truth to you, so also our boast to Titus became truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And his bowels are more abundant toward you, remembering the obedience of you all, how ye received him with fear and trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And, brothers, we declare to you the grace of God that has been given in the congregations of Macedonia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy, even from the depth of their poverty, abounded for the wealth of their generosity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">so that according to their ability, I testify, and beyond their ability, willingly,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">with much exhortation, begging of us the favor, even the fellowship of service for the sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was not as we expected, but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us through the will of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">for us to urge Titus that, as he earlier began this kindness, so he would even finish it for you also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us, so that ye may also abound in this kindness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I speak not from commandment, but because of the zeal of others, also examining the genuineness of your love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was rich he became poor for your sakes, so that by that man's poverty ye might become rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And in this I give judgment, for this is expedient for you who earlier began, from a year ago, not only the doing but also the intending.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now also finish the doing, so that just as was the willingness of the intending, so also to finish from the having.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For if the willingness is present, it is acceptable to the extent if some man has, not to the extent he does not have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For it is not so that ease is for others and stress for you, but out of parity your abundance at the present time is for the need of those men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So that the abundance of those men may also happen for your need, so that there may become equity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">as it is written, he of much did not abound, and he of little did not lack.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But thanks to God who gives the same eagerness for you in the heart of Titus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Because he indeed accepted the exhortation, but his own will being more zealous, he went forth to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And we sent along with him the brother whose praise in the good news is throughout all the congregations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And not only so, but who was also chosen by the congregations, a traveling companion of us with this gift administered by us, for the glory of the same Lord and our willingness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Arranging this lest any man may criticize us in this bounty administered by us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">providing things right, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And we sent along with them our brother whom we often proved being diligent in many things, but is now much more diligent (with much confidence toward you)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">whether on behalf of Titus my partner and co-workman for you, or our brothers, apostles of congregations, a glory of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore show ye the proof of your love and our boast about you, for them in the face of the congregations.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For indeed it is superfluous for me to write to you about the service for the sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I know your willingness, which I boast about you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared from a year ago. And your zeal provoked the majority.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But I sent the brothers so that our boast about you would not be empty in this regard. So that, as I said, ye may be prepared,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">if somehow Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared, we (that we might not say, ye) would be embarrassed in this confidence of boast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers that they would go ahead to you, and arrange in advance your gift that was earlier announced, for this to be ready this way as a gift and not as an exaction.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who indeed am lowly in presence among you, but am bold toward you when absent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But I pray not to be bold when present with the confidence by which I consider to be valiant toward some who consider us as walking according to flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For though walking in flesh, we do not war according to flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty in God for the demolition of strongholds,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Because, The letters, he says, are indeed weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is disdained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let such a man think this, that such kind we are in word by letters when absent, we are also such kind when present in the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For we dare not classify or compare ourselves to some of those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves to themselves, do not understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we will not boast in things immeasurable, but according to the measure of the standard that God apportioned to us, of a measure to reach even as far as you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is not as not reaching for you. We overextend ourselves. For we even reached as far as you in the good news of the Christ,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves into apostles of Christ.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">(Really, to me boasting is not helpful.) For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in body, I know not, or whether outside the body, I know not, God knows) such a man was caught up as far as the third heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I know such a man (whether in body, or whether outside the body, I know not, God knows)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">that he was caught up into the paradise, and heard inexpressible sayings that are not permitted for a man to utter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For such a man I will boast, but for myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For if I should want to boast, I will not be foolish, for I will speak the truth. But I refrain lest any man should reckon to me above what he sees of me or hears anything from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And so that I might not be over exalted by the extraordinariness of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, an agent of Satan so that he would buffet me, so that I would not be over exalted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I besought the Lord thrice about this, that it might depart from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for my power is made fully perfect in weakness. More gladly therefore I will boast in my weaknesses, so that the power of the Christ may reside in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore I am pleased in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in restrictions, for the sake of Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I have become foolish, boasting. Ye compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I came short in nothing of those, superlative apostles, even though I am nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Indeed the signs of the apostle were performed among you in all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For what is there which ye were inferior to the other congregations? Except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, a third time I fare readily to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you, for I seek not the things of you, but you. For the children ought not lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I most gladly will spend, and will be spent for your souls. Even though more earnestly loving you, the worse I am loved.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Any man of whom I have sent to you, did I exploit you through him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I encouraged Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus exploit you in anything? Did we not walk in the same spirit, not in the same steps?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Again, do ye think that we are making defense to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For I fear lest somehow, having come, I may find you not such as I want, and I may be found by you such as ye do not want, lest somehow there be strifes, envyings, wraths, selfish ambitions, slanderings, whisperings, puffings up, turmoils,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">lest having come again my God will make me low toward you, and I will bewail many of those who have sinned previously, and who did not repent from the trash and fornication and licentiousness that they committed.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">This third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two witnesses or three every saying will be confirmed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I have told you before, and I say in advance, as present the second time, and now absent, I write to those who have previously sinned, and to all the others, that if I come to it again, I will not spare,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">since ye seek proof of the Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but is mighty in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For even if he was crucified from weakness, yet he lives from the power of God. For we in him are also weak, but we will live with him from the power of God toward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Examine yourselves whether ye are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? Unless ye are test-failing something.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I hope that ye will know that we are not test-failing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now I pray to God, to do you nothing harmful, not that we would appear test-passing, but that ye would do right, even like we might be test-failing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we do not have any power against the truth, but for the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong. And this also we pray for, your full qualification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Because of this I write these things while absent, so that I may not act harshly when present, according to the authority that the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, an apostle (not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and all the brothers with me, to the congregations of Galatia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who gave himself for our sins, so that he might rescue us, according to the will of our God and Father, out of the evil age that has come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">to whom is the glory into the ages of the ages. Truly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him who called you in the grace of Christ to another good news,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">which is not another, except there are some who confuse you, and who want to pervert the good news of the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But even if we, or an agent from heaven, should preach a good news to you contrary to what we preached to you, let him be accursed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As we have said before, I now also say again, if any man preaches a good news to you contrary to what ye received, let him be accursed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For do I now trust men or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I were still pleasing men I would not be a bondman of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I make known to you, brothers, the good news that was preached by me, that it is not according to man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but it was through revelation of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For ye heard of my former behavior in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God to extraordinariness, and ravaged it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries among my race, being a more extreme zealot of my paternal traditions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's belly, and called me through his grace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to reveal his Son in me, so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not straightaway confer with flesh and blood,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the apostles before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again to Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I did not see another of the apostles except James the Lord's brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now what I write to you, behold before God, I do not lie.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Later I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And I was unknown by face to the congregations of Judea in Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but they were only hearing that the man who once persecuted us now preaches the good news, the faith that he once ravaged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they glorified God in me.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken along Titus also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I went up according to revelation, and I declared to them the good news that I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of repute, lest somehow I might be running or ran in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But not even Titus with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But that issue was because of those false brothers smuggled in, who sneaked in to spy out our liberty that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might enslave us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour, so that the truth of the good news might continue with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But from those who were reputed to be something (what kind they were formerly, it makes no difference to me, God does not accept a personage of man), for those who were of repute added nothing to me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but to the contrary, when they saw that I was entrusted with the good news for men of uncircumcision, as Peter for men of circumcision</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">(for he who was working in Peter for the apostleship for men of circumcision was also working in me for the Gentiles),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and James and Cephas and John, those who were reputed to be pillars, when they understood the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship. So that we were for the Gentiles, and they for men of circumcision,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">only that we should remember the poor, which this same thing I also was eager to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Peter came to Antioch I opposed him to the face, because he was blameworthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For before certain men came from James he ate together with the Gentiles, but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing men of circumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the other Jews also joined in hypocrisy with him, so that even Barnabas went along with their hypocrisy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly toward the truth of the good news, I said to Peter before all, If thou being a Jew, live as a Gentile and not as a Jew, why do thou compel the Gentiles to live as Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We are Jews by nature and not sinful men of the Gentiles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">knowing that a man is not made righteous from works of law, instead through faith of Jesus Christ. And we believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made righteous from faith of Christ, and not from works of law, because no flesh will be made righteous from works of law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if, while seeking to be made righteous in Christ, we ourselves were also found sinful, then is Christ an aide of sin? May it not happen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if I build again these things that I tore down, I demonstrate myself a transgressor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I, through law, died to law, so that I might live to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. And what I now live in flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself up for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I do not disregard the grace of God, for if righteousness is through law, then Christ died in vain.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">O foolish Galatians, who bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was earlier described among you, crucified?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I only want to learn this from you. Did ye receive the Spirit from works of law, or from a listening ear of faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Are ye so foolish, having begun in Spirit, are ye now made perfect by flesh?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Did ye suffer so many things in vain? If it is indeed in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you and who works miracles among you, is it from works of law or from a listening ear of faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Just as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Ye know therefore that those from faith, these are sons of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the scripture having foreseen that God makes the Gentiles righteous from faith, proclaimed the good news in advance to Abraham: In thee all the nations will be blessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So then those from faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For as many as are from works of law are under a curse, for it is written, Cursed is every man who does not continue in all things written in the book of the law, to do them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But that no man is made righteous by law before God, is evident, because, The righteous man will live from faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the law is not from faith, but the man who does them will live in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, Cursed is every man who hangs on a tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So that the blessing of Abraham might occur for the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Brothers (I speak according to a man), in the same way of a man, no man annuls or adds to a contract that has been ratified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, And to the seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to thy seed, who is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I say this, a covenant previously confirmed by God in Christ, the law, which happened four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul in order to make the promise useless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if the inheritance is from law, it is no longer from promise. But God has given it to Abraham through promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Why then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, until the seed would come to whom it was promised, which was arranged through agents in the hand of a mediator.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now a mediator is not of one, but God is one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Is the law therefore against the promises of God? May it not happen! For if a law was given that could make alive, truly righteousness would be from law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But scripture confined all things under sin, so that the promise from faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But before faith came we were kept in custody under law, having been confined for faith that was going to be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So that the law became our schoolmaster for Christ, so that we might be made righteous from faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But faith having come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For ye are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For as many as were immersed into Christ have put on Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There is no Jew nor Greek, there is no bondman nor freeman, there is no male and female, for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And if ye are Christ's, then ye are Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But I say the heir, for as long a time as he is a child, differs nothing from a bondman though he is lord of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Instead he is under stewards and managers until the time appointed from the father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And so when we were children, we were in bondage under the rudiments of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born from a woman, born under law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">so that he might redeem those under law, so that we might receive the sonship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So that thou are no longer a bondman but a son, and if a son, then an heir through Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But of course not knowing God then, ye were in bondage to those in nature who are not gods,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">They are zealous for you but not honorably. They want to exclude you, so that ye may be zealous for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But to be zealous of is always good in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My little children, of whom I suffer birth pains again until Christ is formed in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But I was wishing to be present with you now and to change my tone, because I am perplexed at you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Tell me those desiring to be under law, do ye not hear the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one from the servant girl, and one from the freewoman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But in fact, the man from the servant girl was born according to flesh, but the man from the freewoman through promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Which things are allegorized, for these are two covenants, indeed one from mount Sinai giving birth for bondage, which is Hagar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and it corresponds to the present Jerusalem, and is in bondage with her children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the Jerusalem above is free, which is mother of us all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren woman not giving birth. Burst forth and shout, thou not suffering birth pains, because many more are the children of the desolate than of her who has the husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now we, brothers, who correspond to Isaac, are children of promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But just as then, the man who was born according to flesh persecuted the man according to Spirit, so also now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Nevertheless, what does the scripture say? Send away the servant girl and her son, for the son of the servant girl will, no, not inherit with the son of the freewoman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So then, brothers, we are not children of a servant girl, but of the freewoman.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Stand firm therefore in the liberty in which Christ freed us, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And I solemnly declare again to every man who is circumcised, that he is obligated to do the whole law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Ye were discharged from the Christ, ye who are made righteous by law. Ye have fallen from grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we through Spirit, from faith, wait for a hope of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Ye were running well. Who hindered you, not to obey the truth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This persuasion is not from him who calls you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">O that those who trouble you would even cut it all off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For ye, brothers, were called to liberty, only not liberty for an opportunity to the flesh, but be servants to each other through love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if ye bite and devour each other, watch out that ye be not consumed by each other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But I say, walk in Spirit and ye will, no, not fulfill a lust of flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit is against the flesh. For these are hostile to each other, so that whatever these things are ye may want, ye may not do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if ye are led by Spirit ye are not under law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now the works of the flesh are apparent, which are, adultery, fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, strifes, jealousies, wraths, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">envyings, murders, intoxications, revelings, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, as I also did forewarn, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Bear the burdens of each other, and so fulfill the law of the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For if some man presumes to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have the boast in himself alone and not in the other man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For each man will bear his own burden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But let him who is taught in the word share in all good things with him who teaches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Be not misled, God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows this he will also reap.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Because he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And let us not be weary doing good, for in our own time we will reap, not desponding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So then as we have time, let us work what is good toward all men, and especially toward those belonging to a household of the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">See in how large letters I wrote to you with my hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As many as desire to make a good impression in flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only so that they may not be persecuted for the cross of the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For not even those who have been circumcised themselves keep law, but they want you to be circumcised, so that they may boast in thy flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But may it not be from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And as many as will march by this standard, peace upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Finally, let no man cause troubles for me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Because our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principal offices, against the positions of authority, against the world-rulers of the darkness of this age, against the spiritual things of wickedness in the heavenly things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Because of this take ye up the full armor of God, so that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Stand ye therefore having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and having shod your feet in preparation of the good news of peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Above all having taken up the shield of faith, by which ye will be able to quench all the fiery darts of evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">praying through every prayer and entreaty at every time in spirit, and being alert in this same thing in all perseverance and entreaty for all the sanctified,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">But that ye also may know the things concerning me, what I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful helper in the Lord, will make known all things to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Whom I sent to you for this same thing, so that ye might know the things about us, and that he might encourage your hearts.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I thank my God upon every memory of you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">always in my every entreaty for all of you, making the entreaty with joy</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for your participation in the good news from the first day until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Being confident of this same thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Just as it is right for me to think this about all of you, because I have you in my heart, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the good news, you all being partners with me of the grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For God is my witness, how I long for you all in bowels of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for you to examine the things that are significant. So that ye may be tested by sunlight and not stumbling toward the day of Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">having been filled with fruits of righteousness, through Jesus Christ, for glory and praise of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But I want you to know, brothers, that the things in respect to me have come more for the advancement of the good news,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">in order for my bonds in Christ to become apparent in the whole Praetorium, and in all the others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And more of the brothers in the Lord have been convinced by my bonds to be much more bold to speak the word fearlessly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Actually some even preach the Christ because of envy and strife, and some also because of good-will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Some indeed proclaim the Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to bring affliction to my bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But some from love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">What then? Except in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice, but also I will rejoice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I know that this will turn out to me for salvation (through your entreaty, and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">according to my eager expectation and hope that I will be shamed in nothing. But with all boldness, now as always, Christ will also be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But if to live in flesh, this is fruit of labor to me, then what I will choose I know not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And I am constrained by the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, being far better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But to remain in the flesh is more necessary because of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And having been convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and will continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So that your pride may abound in Christ Jesus in me because of my presence with you again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Only be citizens worthy of the good news of the Christ, so that, whether having come and having seen you or being absent, I may hear things about you that ye stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And not being frightened in anything by those who oppose, which is indeed a sign of destruction to them, but to you of salvation, and this from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Because to you it was granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">having the same conflict such as ye saw in me, and now hear is in me.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">If therefore any exhortation is in Christ, if any encouragement of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">fulfill my joy, that ye may think the same way, having the same love, being knit in soul, thinking in oneness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">in nothing according to selfish ambition or empty conceit, but in humility considering each other surpassing yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Look ye out each man not to things of yourselves, but each man also to the things of others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Indeed have this way to think in you, that also was in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal to God something to seize and hold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But he emptied himself, having taken a form of a bondman, having become in a likeness of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And having been found in a form like a man, he lowered himself, having become obedient until death, even of death from a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name above every name,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of the heavenly, and the earthly, and the sub-earthly,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and that every tongue should acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore my beloved, just as ye have always obeyed, not only as in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For it is God who works in you both to desire and to work for approval.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Do all things without grumblings and arguments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">so that ye may become blameless and pure children of God, blameless in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Holding firm the word of life, for a boast by me in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Yet even if I am poured out a libation upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And in the same way, ye also be glad and rejoice with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I also may be cheerful when I know the things about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For I have no man like-minded who will genuinely care for the things about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For they all seek the things of themselves, not the things of Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child to a father, he served with me for the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Indeed therefore I hope to send this man immediately, whenever I may focus on the things concerning me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come soon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and co-workman and fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">since he was longing for you all, and distressed because ye heard that he was sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For also he was sick, near death, but God was merciful to him, and not only him, but also me, so that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore I sent him more urgently, so that having seen him again, ye may rejoice, and I may be less sorrowful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men esteemed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Because for sake of the work of the Christ he came near the point of death, handing over his life so that he might fill up the deficiency of your service toward me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is really not irksome to me, but safe for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workmen, beware of the excision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we are the circumcision, men who worship in spirit to God, and who boast in Christ Jesus, and not being confident in flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Although (I having confidence also in flesh) if any other man seems to be confident in the flesh, I more:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">in circumcision the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; regarding law, a Pharisee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">regarding zeal, persecuting the church; regarding the righteousness in law, having become blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But whatever was gain to me, these things I regarded loss because of the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But indeed therefore I even consider all things to be loss because of things surpassing, of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, because of whom I suffered the loss of all things, and consider them to be rubbish, so that I may gain Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and be found in him, not having my righteousness, that from law, but that through Christ's faith-the righteousness from God based on faith-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">to know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the participation of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">if somehow I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Not that I have already obtained or have already been fully perfected, but I press forward, if also I might seize upon that for which also I was seized by Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Brothers, I reckon myself not to have seized, but one thing, indeed forgetting the things behind, and reaching forward to the things ahead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I press forward toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As many therefore as are perfect should think this way. And if ye think anything differently, this also God will reveal to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">However in what we have attained, to march by the same standard, to think the same way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Brothers, become fellow-imitators of me, and watch those who so walk, just as ye have us for an example.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For many walk, who (I told you often, and now also say while weeping) are enemies of the cross of Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and the glory in their shame, who mind earthly things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For our citizenship exists in the heavens, from which also we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">who will transform the body of our lowliness, in order for it to become similar in form to the body of his glory, according to the working of his power even to subject all things to himself.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Yes, I ask thee also, genuine yokefellow, help them-the women who labored with me in the good news-with Clement also, and the rest of my co-workmen whose names are in the book of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Be anxious about nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thankfulness make your requests known to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Finally brothers, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are commendable, if anything is a virtue, and if anything is praiseworthy, think on these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And what ye learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do, and the God of peace will be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last ye have revived thinking about me, in which also ye were thinking, but ye lacked opportunity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Not that I speak regarding need, for I have learned in what things I am to be content.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I know both how to be abased and how to abound. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be lacking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I can do all things in the Christ who strengthens me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nevertheless ye did well having shared with my affliction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And ye Philippians also have seen that, in the beginning of the good news when I departed from Macedonia, not one congregation shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except ye only,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">because also in Thessalonica ye sent both once and again to my need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that abounds to your account.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But I receive all things, and I abound. I have been filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you, an aroma of fragrance, an acceptable sacrifice well-pleasing to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And my God will fill your every need according to his wealth in glory in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now to our God and Father is the glory into the ages of the ages. Truly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Salute every sanctified man in Christ Jesus. The brothers with me salute you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And ye became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For ye yourselves know, brothers, our entrance with you, that it has not become empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But having suffered before and been mistreated in Philippi, as ye know, we were bold in our God to speak to you the good news of God within much conflict.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For our exhortation is not from error, nor from uncleanness, nor in deception,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good news, thus we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who proves our hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we came neither in word of flattery (at any time as ye know) nor a pretense of greed (God is witness)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">For ye remember, brothers, our labor and the hardship. For, laboring night and day in order not to burden any of you, we preached to you the good news of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And because of this we thank God without ceasing, because, having received the word of God heard from us, ye received not the word of men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which also is at work in you who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For ye, brothers, became imitators of the congregations of God, which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because ye also suffered the same things by your own countrymen, just as also they by the Jews.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Because of this, I too, no longer covering over it, sent in order to know your faith, lest somehow he who tempts was tempting you, and our labor became in vain.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">not in passion of lust, as also the Gentiles who have not known God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">not to transgress and to cheat his brother in the affair, because the Lord is vengeful about all these things, as also we forewarned you and solemnly testified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For God did not call us to uncleanness, but in sanctification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore he who disregards, disregards not man, but God, who also gave his Holy Spirit to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But about brotherly love ye have no need to write to you, for ye yourselves are taught by God in order to love each other.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">and to aspire to live quietly, and to do your own things, and to work with your own hands, just as we commanded you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so that ye may walk properly toward those outside, and may have nothing lacking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about those who are asleep, so that ye may not grieve, as also the others who have no hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if we believe that Jesus died and arose, so also those who became asleep through Jesus, God will bring with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this we say to you in the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain for the coming of the Lord, will no, not precede those who became asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with a voice of the arch-agent, and with a trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">then we who are alive, who remain, will be caught up simultaneously with them in clouds to the Lord's gathering in the air. And so we will always be with the Lord.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But about the times and the seasons, brothers, ye have no need to be written to you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">But ye, brothers, are not in darkness, so that the day would seize you as a thief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Ye are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So then let us not sleep, as also the others, but let us watch and be sober.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are intoxicated get drunk at night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But we, being of the day, should be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and a helmet, the hope of salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Because God appointed us not for wrath, but for an acquired possession of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So that, whether we are awake or sleep, we should live together with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore encourage each other, and build ye up one by one, just as ye also are doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And we ask you, brothers, to acknowledge those who labor among you, and who lead you in the Lord, and who admonish you,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">I thank my God, making recollection of thee always in my prayers,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">God, who formerly spoke in many portions and in many ways to the fathers by the prophets, spoke to us in these last days by a Son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the ages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Who, being the radiance of his glory, and the exact image of his essence, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having made purification of our sins through himself, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in the heights.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Having become so much better than the agents, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For to which of the agents did he ever say, Thou are my Son, today I have begotten thee? And again, I will be to him for a Father, and he will be to me for a Son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And again when he brings the firstborn into the world he says, And let all the agents of God worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And indeed toward the agents he says, He who makes his agents spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But toward the Son, Thy throne, O God, is into the age of the age. The scepter of thy kingdom is a scepter of straightness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Thou have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. Because of this, God, thy God, anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And thou, Lord, at the beginnings founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They will perish, but thou are permanent. And they will all become old as a garment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And thou will roll them up as a mantle, and they will be changed. But thou are the same, and thy years will not cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But to which of the agents has he ever said, Sit thou by my right hand until I place thine enemies a footstool of thy feet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth for service for the sake of those who are going to inherit salvation?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Because of this we ought to give more earnest heed to the things that were heard, lest we might slip away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if the word spoken through agents became certain, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">how will we escape, having neglected so great a salvation? Which first, having taken to be spoken by the Lord, was verified for us by those who heard;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God also testifying simultaneously by signs and wonders, and by various powers and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For he did not subject the coming world to agents, about which we speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But a certain man has somewhere testified, saying, What is man, that thou remember him? Or a son of man, that thou help him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Thou made him a little something less than the agents. Thou crowned him with glory and honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Thou subordinated all things under his feet. For in subordinating all things to him, he left nothing not subordinate to him. But now we do not yet see all things subordinated to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we see Jesus who has been made a little something less than the agents, who, because of the suffering of death, has been crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God he would taste of death for every man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For it was fitting for him, through whom are all things, and because of whom are all things, having brought many sons to glory, to make the pathfinder of their salvation fully perfect through sufferings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For both he who sanctifies and those being sanctified are all of one, because of which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">saying, I will declare thy name to my brothers. In the midst of the congregation I will sing praise to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And again, I will be a man who has trusted in him. And again, Behold, I and the children that God has given me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Since therefore the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might make him who has the power of death impotent, that is, the devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he might liberate these, as many as throughout all their lifetime were deserving of bondage, with a specter of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For he certainly did not embrace agents, but he embraced the seed of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore he was obligated to be made like his brothers in accordance with all things, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things toward God, in order to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For in that he himself has suffered, having been tempted, he is able to help those being tempted.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Because of which, holy brothers, companions of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our affirmation, Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this man was considered worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he who built it has more esteem than the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For every house is built by some man, but he who built all things is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Moses was indeed faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of the things that were going to be spoken,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but Christ as a Son over his house, whose house we are, if only we keep in possession our confidence and pride of hope, firm until the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, Today if ye hear his voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, according to the day of the trial in the wilderness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">where your fathers challenged me, tested me, and saw my works forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore I was angry with that generation, and said, They are always led astray in their heart, and they did not know my ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I swore in my wrath, They will not enter into my rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Watch, brothers, lest there will be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in withdrawing from the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But exhort each other during each day, while it is called Today, lest any of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we have become companions of the Christ, if only we keep in possession the primacy of the essence, steadfast until the end,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">while it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For some who heard rebelled, but not all those who came out of Egypt by Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But with whom was he angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to whom did he swear were not going to enter into his rest, if not to those who were disobedient?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let us be afraid therefore, lest, a promise being left behind to enter into his rest, any of you should seem to have come short.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For we also are having good news preached, just as also those men, but the word of hearing did not benefit those men, not having been mixed together with faith in those who heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For those who believe enter into that rest, just as he said, So I swore in my wrath, They will not enter into my rest, although the works occurred from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For he spoke somewhere about the seventh this way, And God rested during the seventh day from all his works,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and in this again, They will not enter into my rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Since therefore it remains for some to enter into it, and those who formerly had good news did not enter because of disobedience,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">again he appoints a certain day, Today, saying in David after so long a time (as it is said), Today if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken about another day after these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There remains therefore a sabbath for the people of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For a man who has entered into his rest, he has also rested from his works, as God did from his own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest, so that not any man may fall by the same example of disobedience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the word of God is living, and potent, and sharper, above every two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division both of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and discernible of the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there is no creature concealed from his presence, but all things are naked and vulnerable to his eyes, before whom is the word to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us take hold of the affirmation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but who was tempted in all things in the same way, without sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let us therefore come near with boldness to the throne of grace, so that we may take mercy, and may find grace for timely help.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For every high priest taken from men is appointed for men in things toward God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Who can be gentle to those who are ignorant and led astray, since he himself is also encompassed with weakness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And because of this he is obligated, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And not any man takes the honor to himself, but being called by God, just as also Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So also Christ did not glorify himself to become a high priest, but it was he who said to him, Thou are my Son, today I have begotten thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">(And just as he says in another, Thou are a priest into the age according to the order of Melchizedek.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who, in the days of his flesh, having offered up both prayers and supplications with strong shouting and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and who was heard because of his reverence,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">although being a Son, he learned obedience from the things that he suffered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And having been fully perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">About whom, much subject matter from us is also difficult to explain, since ye have become sluggish in hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For also men who ought to be teachers because of the time, ye have need again for some man to teach you the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and have become men who have need of milk, and not of solid food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For every man partaking of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is childlike.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But solid food is for mature men, those having their sensibilities trained through practice for the discernment of both good and evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore having left the word of the primacy of Christ, let us be brought forward to perfection, not again laying a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">of doctrine of washings, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And this we will do, if of course God will permit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and who tasted of the heavenly gift, and who became partakers of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and who tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and who fell away, to restore again to repentance, crucifying to themselves the Son of God, and disgracing him publicly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the soil that has drunk the rain often coming upon it, and bringing forth vegetation useful for those by whom also it is cultivated, partakes of a blessing from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But producing thorns and thistles it is unfit and near a curse, the end of which is for burning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we are persuaded better things about you, beloved, and things that have salvation, even though we speak this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the labor of love that ye showed toward his name, having served the sanctified, and who are serving.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And we earnestly desire each of you to show the same diligence toward the full assurance of the hope until the end,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so that ye may not become lazy, but imitators of those who, through faith and longsuffering, inherit the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For God who promised to Abraham, since he had none greater to swear by, swore by himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">saying, Surely indeed, blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And this way, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For men certainly swear by the greater, and of every dispute with them the oath is final for confirmation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">By which God, wanting to demonstrate more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutableness of his resolve, confirmed it by an oath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So that by two immutable events, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have strong encouragement, having fled for refuge to seize the hope being openly displayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Which we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and that enters into the interior of the veil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">where the forerunner, Jesus, entered for us, having become a high priest into the age according to the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, having met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, also blessed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To whom also Abraham divided a tenth of all. Being actually translated, first, king of righteousness, and then also, king of Salem, which is king of peace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but having been made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And notice how great this man was, to whom also the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the best spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now indeed those of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have commandment to collect tithes from the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, although having come out of the loins of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the man who did not descend from them has received tithes from Abraham, and has blessed the man having the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And without all contradiction the inferior is blessed by the superior.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And here indeed, men who die receive tithes, but there, he who is testified about that he lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And, so to speak, Levi also, the man who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If indeed therefore perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people had received the law), what further need is there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the priesthood being changed, of necessity a change of law also occurs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, from which no man has attended to the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is evident that our Lord arose out of Judah, regarding which tribe Moses spoke nothing about the priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it is still far more evident, if according to the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who has become, not according to a law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an indestructible life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he testifies, Thou are a priest into the age according to the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For indeed there becomes an annulment of a preceding commandment because of its weakness and uselessness</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(for the law made nothing fully perfect), and an introduction of a better hope, through which we approach God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And inasmuch as it is not without an oath. For actually those who become priests are so without an oath,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but he with an oath, because of him who says to him, The Lord swore and will not change his mind, Thou are a priest into the age according to the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">By so much, Jesus has become the surety of a better covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And of course those who have become priests are more, because of being prevented to continue by death,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but he, because of his remaining into the age, has the priesthood unchangeable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Whereupon he is able also to save to the uttermost those who come to God through him, being always alive in order to intercede on their behalf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For such a high priest is fitting for us, devout, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and having become higher than the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Who has no need to offer up sacrifices each day, as those high priests, first for his own sins, then for those of the people, for this he did, once, when he offered up himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the law appoints men high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath after the law, a Son who has been fully perfected into the age.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now a summation about the things being spoken is, we have such a high priest who was seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">a minister of the holy things, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord erected and not man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For every high priest is appointed in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices, whereupon it is necessary for this man also to have something that he may offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For certainly if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, there being the priests who offer the gifts according to the law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">who serve for an example and shadow of the heavenly things. Just as Moses who was divinely warned while going to complete the tabernacle, for he says, See thou make all things according to the pattern that was shown thee on the mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now he has obtained a superior ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a superior covenant, which has been enacted upon superior promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if that first one was faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For, finding fault with them, he says, Behold, the days come, says the Lord, and I will perfect a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by my hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. Because they did not continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Because this is the covenant that I will ordain with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord, giving my laws into their mind, and I will write them on their hearts. And I will be to them for a God, and they will be to me for a people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they will, no, not teach each man his fellow citizen, and each man his brother, saying, Know the Lord, because all will know me, from their small as far as their great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Because I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins and their lawlessness I will no, not further remember.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In saying, New, he has made the first old. And what is becoming old and obsolete is near disappearance.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now indeed therefore the first had ordinances of divine service and the earthly sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For a tabernacle was prepared, the first in which was also the lampstand, and the table, and the presentation of the loaves, which is called the Holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And behind the second curtain, the tabernacle called the Holy of holies,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid entirely in gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And above it were cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of forgiveness, about which things it is not now to speak in detail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And these things thus having been prepared, the priests indeed enter into the first part of the tabernacle continually, accomplishing the services.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But into the second part, the high priest alone, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">this signifying from the Holy Spirit, the way into the holy things is not yet to be made known while the first tabernacle still remains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which is a figure for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered that are not able to make the man officiating fully perfect in respect to conscience,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">only in foods and drinks and various washings: carnal ordinances imposed until a time of reformation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Christ, having arrived a high priest of the good things that are coming, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, he entered in once into the Holy things, having found eternal redemption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling those who were defiled, sanctifies for the purification of the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">how much more the blood of Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered himself unblemished to God, will cleanse your conscience from dead works in order to serve a living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And because of this he is mediator of a new covenant, so that a death having occurred for the redemption of the transgressions against the first covenant, those who are called might take the promise of the eternal inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For where a covenant is, a necessity is to present the death of the man who made the covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For a covenant is effective with the dead, since it is never enforced while the man who made the covenant lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whereupon neither has the first been dedicated without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For of every commandment according to law that was spoken by Moses to all the people, after taking the blood of the calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, This is the blood of the covenant that God made for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And likewise he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood, and remission does not occur without bloodshed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Indeed therefore, a necessity was for the models of the things in the heavens themselves to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things with better sacrifices than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For the Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, representative of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And not so that he might offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the Holy things each year with blood by another,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">since it would be necessary for him to suffer often, from the foundation of the world. But now once, at the end of the ages, he was made known for an annulment of sin by the sacrifice of himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And inasmuch as it is reserved to men once to die, and after this, judgment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">so also the Christ, having been offered once in order to take up the sins of many, will appear a second time, independent of sin, to those waiting for him for salvation.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For the law having a shadow of the good things that are coming, not the same substance of the events, with the same sacrifices that are offered continually each year, they are never able to fully perfect those who are approaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Otherwise would they not have ceased being offered, because of those who worship, once having been cleansed, to have no further conscience of sins?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But in them is a reminder of sins each year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering thou did not desire, but thou prepared for me a body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In whole burnt offerings, and for sin thou were not pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I said, Lo, I come (in the volume of a book it is written about me) to do thy will, O God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">saying above, Sacrifice and offering and whole burnt offerings and for sin thou did not desire, nor were thou pleased with things that are offered according to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then he said, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He takes away the first, so that he may establish the second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">By which will we are sanctified through the one time offering of the body of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And indeed every priest stands daily serving and offering the same sacrifices often, which can never take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But this man, having offered one sacrifice on behalf of sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">waiting henceforth until his enemies are placed a footstool of his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For by one offering he has fully perfected forever those being sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, after indeed foretelling,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This is the covenant that I will ordain with them after those days, says the Lord, giving my laws on their hearts, and on their minds I will write them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and, Their sins and their lawlessness I will, no, not further remember.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now where there is remission of these, there is no more offering for sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entrance into the holy things by the blood of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">which he inaugurated for us, a new and living way through the curtain, that is, his flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and a great priest over the house of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our body washed in pure water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Let us hold firm the affirmation of the hope unwavering, for he who promised is faithful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And let us examine each other for provocation of love and good works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Not forsaking the assembling together of ourselves, as is the habit of some, but exhorting, and so much the more as long as ye see the day approaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For when we sin willfully after taking the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and of fire, a fervor that is going to devour the opposition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Any man who has disregarded the law of Moses dies without mercies from two or three witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">By how much worse punishment do ye think he will deserve who has trampled the Son of God, and who considered profane the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and who treated the Spirit of grace contemptuously?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For we know him who said, Vengeance is for me, I will repay, says the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But remember the former days, in which, after being enlightened, ye endured a great contest of sufferings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">partly made a spectacle, both by reviling and afflictions, and partly having become companions of those so treated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For ye were both compassionate about my bonds, and ye accepted with joy the plundering of your possessions, knowing yourselves to have a superior and an enduring existence in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Therefore do not throw off your boldness, which has great recompense of reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For ye have need of perseverance, so that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For yet a very little while, he who is coming will come, and will not delay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But the righteous man will live from faith, and if he should withdraw, my soul is not pleased with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But we are not of retreat for destruction, but of faith for the preservation of the soul.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now faith is the foundation of hoping, the evidence of events not being seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For by this the ancients were well reported.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">By faith we understand the ages to have been prepared by the word of God. For the things that are seen do not come to be from that which is visible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, because of which he was reported to be righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through it, he who died still speaks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">By faith Enoch was transferred to not see death, and he was not found, because God transferred him. For before his removal he was reported to be pleasing to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And apart from faith it is impossible to please him. For he who comes to God must believe that he is, and becomes a rewarder of those who search for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">By faith Noah, being divinely warned about things not yet seen, moved with awe, prepared an ark for the salvation of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became an heir of righteousness according to faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">By faith Abraham, when called, obeyed to go out to the place that he was going to take for an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">By faith he lived alien in the land of promise as a foreigner, having dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he anticipated the city that has the foundations, whose builder and architect is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">By faith even Sarah herself received power for conception of seed, and she gave birth beyond the time of age, because she considered him faithful who promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And therefore from one man, and these things having become deadened, were begotten as the stars of the heaven for multitude, and as the sand of the seashore, countless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">All these died in faith, not having taken the promises, but who saw and greeted them from afar, and who confessed that they were foreigners and sojourners on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For those who say such things show that they are seeking a fatherland.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And if indeed they remembered that from which they came out, they would have had time to return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But now they aspire for a superior one, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">By faith Abraham, being tested, offered Isaac. And he who received the promises offered his only begotten son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">about whom it was said, The seed by thee will be called in Isaac.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Having reckoned that God is able to raise up even from the dead, from where also, in a figure, he did receive him back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau about things coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">By faith Jacob, while dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and bowed in worship upon the top of his staff.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">By faith Joseph, while perishing, remembered about the exodus of the sons of Israel, and commanded about his bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">By faith Moses, after being born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child well-formed, and they were not afraid of the king's edict.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">By faith Moses, having become great, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">having chosen rather to be mistreated with the people of God, than to have the pleasure of sin temporarily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Having esteemed the vilification of the Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he focused toward the recompense of reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">By faith he forsook Egypt, not having feared the wrath of the king, for he persevered as seeing the invisible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">By faith he performed the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who was destroying the firstborn would not touch them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land, of which the Egyptians, having taken an attempt, were drowned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, having been encircled for seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">By faith Rahab the harlot was not destroyed with those who were disobedient, having received the spies with peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And what shall I say further? For the time would fail me telling about Gideon, also Barak and Samson and Jephthah, also of David and Samuel and the prophets,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">who, through faith, conquered kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, closed the mouths of lions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">quenched the force of fire, escaped the jaw of the sword. Out of weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, bowed down armies of aliens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Women took hold of their dead from a resurrection, but others were tortured, not having accepted deliverance, so that they might experience a superior resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And others took a trial of mockings and scourgings, and moreover of bonds and imprisonment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They were stoned, they were sawed apart, they were tempted, they died in murder by sword. They wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, restricted, tormented</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And all these, having been well reported through faith, did not receive the promise,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">God having foreseen something superior concerning us, so that without us they would not be made fully perfect.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore we also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, having put off every weight and cleverly entangling sin, let us run by perseverance the contest being set before us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Looking to Jesus the pathfinder and perfecter of the faith, who, against the joy set before him, endured a cross, having despised the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For consider the man who endured such hostility against him by sinners, so that ye may not be weary in your souls, being disheartened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Ye have not yet resisted as far as blood, struggling against sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And have ye forgotten the exhortation that reasons with you as with sons, My son, do not disparage the chastening of the Lord, nor become disheartened when punished by him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For whom the Lord loves he chastens. And he whips every son whom he receives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Because of chastening ye endure; God is treating you as with sons, for what son is there whom a father does not chasten?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And if ye are without chastening, of which all have become participants, then ye are bastards, and not sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Besides, we indeed have had chastisers-the fathers of our flesh-and we were turned around. Shall we not much more be subordinate to the Father of the spirits, and we will live?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For those men indeed for a few days chastened us according to that which seemed good to them, but he for that which is advantageous, in order to be partakers of his holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But of course no chastening for the present seems to be of joy but of sorrow, yet afterward it yields peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore lift up the drooping hands, and the feeble knees,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be turned away, but may be healed instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Looking carefully lest any man fall short, away from the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness sprouting up would cause trouble, and by this many may be defiled,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">lest a fornicator or profane man like Esau, who, in place of one meal sold his birthright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For ye also know that wanting afterward to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance, though having sought it with tears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For ye have not come to a mountain being felt, and which burned with fire, and to darkness, and gloom, and a tempest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of words, of which those who heard begged that a word not be added to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For they did not bear that which was commanded, if even a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be stoned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And so fearful was that which was made visible, that Moses said, I am terrified and trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But ye have come to mount Zion, and to the city of a living God, a heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of agents,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">to a festal gathering and assembly of firstborn sons who were enrolled in the heavens, and to God, a Judge of all, and to spirits of righteous men who were made fully perfect,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and to Jesus a mediator of a new covenant, and to blood of sprinkling that speaks better than Abel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Watch, that ye not refuse him who speaks. For if those men did not escape, having refused him who spoke a divine message on earth, much more we, those who turn away from him from the heavens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">whose voice then shook the earth. But now he has promised, saying, Yet once, I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the, Yet once, signifies the removal of the things being shaken-as of things that were made-so that the things not being shaken may remain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore, receiving an immovable kingdom, we may have grace, through which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and awe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For our God is also a consuming fire.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let brotherly love abide.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Remember the prisoners as being in bondage together, those who are ill-treated as also yourselves being in the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Marriage is precious in every way, and the undefiled bed, but God will judge fornicators and adulterers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">For of the beasts whose blood is brought into the holy things for sin by the high priest, the bodies of these are burned outside the camp.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">but the rich in his lowliness, because as a flower of grass he will pass away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the sun rose up with the burning heat, and withered the grass. And the flower of it fell, and the beauty of its appearance perished. So also the rich man will fade away among his pursuits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Blessed is a man who endures temptation, because, having become approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted by God, for God is without temptation of evils, and he himself tempts no man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But each man is tempted by his own lust, being drawn away and enticed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">But become ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this resembles a man observing his natural face in a mirror.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">For if a man with a gold ring in bright clothing comes into your synagogue, and also a poor man in dirty clothing comes in,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and ye have regard for the man wearing the bright clothing, and say to him, Sit thou here well, and ye say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit here below my footstool,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">then are ye not partial among yourselves, and become judges from evil thoughts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Listen, my beloved brothers, did not God choose the poor of the world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which he promised to those who love him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But ye have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich exploit you, and they themselves drag you into courts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Do they not blaspheme the good name that was called upon you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If ye indeed fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if ye respect personages, ye work sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For whoever keeps the whole law, and stumbles on one, he has become guilty of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For he who said thou shall not commit adultery, also said thou shall not murder. Now if thou will not commit adultery, but murder, thou have become a transgressor of law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So speak ye, and so do ye, as men who are to be judged by a law of liberty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For the judgment is merciless to him who did no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">What is the benefit, my brothers, if some man should say to have faith, but has no works? Can the faith save him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And if a brother or sister may be unclothed, and may be destitute of daily food,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and some man of you would say to them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and fed, but ye would not give them the things necessary for the body, what is the benefit?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So also faith, if it has no works, is dead by itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But some man will say, Thou have faith, and I have works. Show me thy faith from thy works, and I will show thee from my works my faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Thou believe that there is one God, thou do well. The demons also believe, and shudder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But do thou want to know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Was not Abraham our father made righteous from works, having offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Thou see that faith was working with his works, and from the works, faith was fully perfected.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness, and he was called a friend of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Ye see therefore that from works a man is made righteous, and not from faith only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And likewise also was not Rahab the harlot made righteous from works, having received the agents, and having sent them out another way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For as the body without a spirit is dead, so also faith without the works is dead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Not many should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive greater judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For we all stumble in many things. If any man does not stumble in word, this is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Behold we put bits into the mouths of horses for them to obey us, and we guide about their whole body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold also the ships, being so great and driven by fierce winds, are guided about by a very small rudder, wherever the impulse of the man who steers determines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So also the tongue is a little body-part, and boasts greatly. Behold a little fire, how much wood it kindles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the tongue is a fire, the world of unrighteousness. Thus, the tongue is made to lead among our body-parts, defiling the whole body, and setting the cycle of nature on fire, and being set on fire by hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For every species, both of beasts and of birds, both of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by the human species.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But no man is able to tame the tongue of men, an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">By it we bless the God and Father, and by it we curse men, who were made according to a likeness of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and curse. My brothers, these things ought not to happen this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Does the spring pour out from the same opening the sweet and the bitter?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A fig tree, my brothers, cannot make olives, or a grapevine figs. In the same way, no one spring makes water salty and sweet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show from his good behavior his works in meekness of wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But if ye have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast, and do not lie against the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">This wisdom is not descending from above, but is earthly, world-soul, demonic.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For where envy and selfish ambition are, there is instability and every evil deed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But the wisdom from above is indeed first pure, then peaceful, gentle, easily entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and non-hypocritical.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace to those who make peace.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">From where are wars and fightings among you? Is it not from here: from your pleasures warring in your body-parts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ye desire and do not have, so ye murder. And ye envy and cannot obtain, so ye fight and make war. Ye do not have, because ye do not ask.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Ye ask, and do not receive, because ye ask wrongly, so that ye may spend on your pleasures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is hatred of God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Or think ye that the scripture says vainly, The Spirit that he caused to dwell in us yearns with jealousy?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, God is opposed to the arrogant, but gives grace to the lowly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Be subordinate therefore to God, but resist the devil and he will flee from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Approach God and he will approach you. Cleanse the hands, ye sinners, and purify the hearts, ye double-minded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Be ye sorrowful, and mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into a downcast look.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Be ye made lower in the sight of the Lord, and he will lift you up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Speak not against each other, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against law and judges law. But if thou judge law, thou are not a doer of law, but a judge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy, but thou, who are thou who judge the other man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Go now, men who say, Today and tomorrow we will go into this city, and will operate one year there, and will engage in trade and will get gain-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">men who know not of the morrow. For what is your life? For it will be a vapor that appears for a little while, and then also vanishes away-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">in place of your saying, If the Lord should will, then we will live and do this or that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But now ye boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He therefore who knows to do good, and is not doing it, to him it is sin.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Go now, ye rich, weep, howling for your miseries that are approaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Your wealth has decayed, and your garments have become moth-eaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Your gold and your silver have cankered, and their corrosion will be testimony against you, and will eat your flesh like fire. Ye have hoarded in the last days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold the wage of the workmen who reaped your fields. The man who was defrauded by you cries out. And the outcries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Ye have lived in luxury on the earth, and were self-indulgent. Ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Ye have condemned, ye have murdered the righteous man. He is not hostile to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it, until it receives the early and latter rain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Be ye also patient. Establish your hearts, because the coming of the Lord has approached.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do not grumble, brothers, against each other, so that ye not be judged. Behold, the judge stands before the doors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Take an example, my brothers, of evil-suffering and longsuffering, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Behold, we regard those who endured, blessed. Ye have heard of the fortitude of Job, and have seen the outcome of the Lord, that he is very compassionate and merciful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But above all things, my brothers, swear not. Neither by the heaven, nor the earth, nor any other oath, but let your yes be yes, and the no, no, so that ye may not fall into hypocrisy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Is any man among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Is any man weak among you? Let him summon the elders of the congregation, and let them pray near him, having anointed him with olive oil in the name of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the prayer of faith will rescue him who is depressed, and the Lord will rouse him. And if he should be a man who has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Confess ye the trespasses to each other, and pray for each other so that ye may be healed. A working supplication of a righteous man is very powerful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Elijah was a man of the same nature as we. And by prayer, he asked for it not to rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Brothers, if any man among you may be led astray from the truth, and some man converts him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">let him know that he who converts a sinful man from his wandering way, will save a soul from death, and will hide a multitude of sins.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen who are sojourners of the Dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of Spirit, for obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace be multiplied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who begot us again according to his abundant mercy for a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for an inheritance imperishable, and undefiled, and unfading, reserved in heavens for you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">men being kept by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In which ye greatly rejoice, although made sorrowful in various trials. Since it is now necessary for a little while,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that the proof of your faith, much more precious than gold that perishes, and though proven by fire, may be found for praise and esteem and for glory at the revealing of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Whom, not having seen, ye love, in whom, not now seeing but believing, ye exult in inexpressible and glorified joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">receiving back the outcome of your faith, the salvation of souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">About which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently. Men who prophesied about the grace for you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">searching for what, or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ in them indicated, predicting the sufferings in Christ, and the glories after these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">To whom it was revealed, that they were serving not themselves, but you, those things that were now reported to you by those who preached good news to you in the Holy Spirit, which was sent forth from heaven, into which things agents longed to stoop to see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore having girded up the loins of your mind, being sober, hope entirely for the grace brought to you at the revealing of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves to the former desires in your ignorance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but according to the Holy Man, he who called you, ye yourselves also become holy in all conduct,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">because it is written, Become ye holy, since I am holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if ye call on a Father, him who judges impartially according to each man's work, live the time of your sojourn in fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Knowing that ye were redeemed from your vain behavior inherited from fathers, not with perishable silver or gold,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">who was indeed foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in the last times because of you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">men who, because of him, believe in God who raised him from the dead, and gave him glory, in order for your faith and hope to be in God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">men who have purified your souls in obedience of the truth through the Spirit for non-hypocritical brotherly love. Ye should love each other fervently from a pure heart,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Because all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as a flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower of it falls away,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, having put off all evil and all deceit and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speaking,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">as newborn babes, long for the genuine intellectual milk, so that ye may grow by it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord is excellent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Coming to whom, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but with God chosen, precious,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It is therefore contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, chosen, precious. And he who believes in him will, no, not be shamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">To you therefore who believe is the preciousness, but for men who disobey, A stone that the builders rejected, this became the head of the corner,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and, A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, men who stumble at the word, being disobedient, for which also they were set.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But ye are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for an acquired possession, so that ye might broadly proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Men formerly not a people, but now are a people of God. Men who had not obtained mercy, but who now have obtained mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Beloved, I beseech you as aliens and sojourners, to abstain from the fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Having your behavior good among the Gentiles, so that, upon which they speak against you as evildoers, they may glorify God in the day of visitation, from having observed your good works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore because of the Lord, ye should submit to every human establishment, whether to a king as being supreme,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">or to governors as being sent by him for vengeance of evildoers and praise of well-doers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Because this way is the will of God, doing good to muzzle the ignorance of the foolish men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As free, and not having your freedom as a cover-up of evil, but as bondmen of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Respect all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Respect the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Household servants, submitting to the masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wayward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For this is graciousness, if, because of consciousness of God, any man endures sorrows, suffering wrongfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For what kind of credit is it, if, sinning and being beaten, ye will endure? But if, doing good and suffering, ye will endure, this is graciousness with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For ye were called for this. Because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example, so that ye should follow his footsteps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Who did no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Who, being reviled, did not revile in return. Suffering, he did not threaten, but yielded to him who judges righteously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Who himself took up our sins in his body upon the tree, so that we, having died to sins, might live to the righteousness of him from whose wound ye were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For ye were like sheep going astray, but now were returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Likewise the wives, being subordinate to their own husbands, so that even if any are disobedient to the word, they will be gained without a word by the behavior of the wives,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">observing, in fear, your pure behavior.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Of which let it not be the outward world of braiding of hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on apparel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible, of the meek and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For this way formerly also, the holy women, trusting in God, adorned themselves, being subordinate to their own husbands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children ye became, doing good, and not being afraid of anything fearful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Likewise the husbands living together knowledgeably, as with a weaker vessel, apportioning worth to the female as also joint-heirs of the grace of life, for your prayers not to be hindered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And finally, all be like-minded, sympathetic, brother-loving, compassionate, friendly,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling, but instead giving praise, knowing that ye were called for this, so that ye might inherit a blessing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he who wants to love life, and see good days, let him restrain his tongue from evil, and his lips not to speak deceit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let him turn away from evil, and do good. Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Because the eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous, and his ears to their supplication, but the face of the Lord is against men who do evil things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And who is he who will harm you, if ye become imitators of the good?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But even if ye should suffer because of righteousness, ye are blessed. But do not fear their terror nor be shaken,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. And always be ready for a defense to every man who asks you a word about the hope in you, with meekness and fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Having a good conscience, so that, in what they speak against you as of evildoers, they may be ashamed, those who revile your good behavior in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For it is better to suffer doing good, if the will of God desires, than for doing evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Because Christ also once suffered for sins, a righteous man for unrighteous men, so that he might bring you to God. Having indeed been killed in flesh, but made alive in spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">in which also, having gone, he preached to the spirits in prison</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">who were disobedient formerly, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah who prepared an ark in which a few, that is, eight souls were saved through water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Which counterpart-immersion-now also saves us, not the putting away of filth of flesh, but an appeal of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, agents, and positions of authority, and powers having been subordinated to him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore of Christ having suffered in flesh for us, arm ye yourselves also with the same mentality, because he who has suffered in flesh has ceased from sin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in order to live the remaining time in flesh, no longer by lusts of men, but by the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For enough time of life has past for you to accomplish the will of the Gentiles, having gone in debaucheries, lusts, excesses of wine, revelings, drinking parties, and lawless idolatries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">During which they think it strange of you not running together into the same pouring out of debauchery, while they slander.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Men who will give back an accounting to him who fares readily to judge the living and the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For good news was preached even to the dead for this, so that they might indeed be judged according to men in flesh, but live according to God in spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the end of all things has approached. Therefore be serious, and be sober for the prayers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And above all having fervent love for yourselves, because love will cover a multitude of sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">stranger-loving toward each other without complaints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As each has received a gift, serving it for yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If any man speaks, as oracles of God. If any man serves, as of ability as God supplies. So that God may be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the dominion into the ages of the ages. Truly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Beloved, ye should not be surprised at the fieriness in you, which occurs for a trial to you, like a strange thing happening to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But rejoice in so far as ye are partakers in the sufferings of the Christ, so that also at the revealing of his glory ye may rejoice, having exceeding joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Blessed are ye if ye are reviled for the name of Christ, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. From them he is indeed blasphemed, but from you he is glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For let not any man of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a busybody.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this regard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Because the time to begin judgment is from the house of God, and if first from us, what is the end of those who disobey the good news of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And if the righteous man is scarcely saved, where will the irreverent and sinful man appear?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore also let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls as to a faithful Creator by well-doing.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I, a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ, and a partaker of the glory going be revealed, exhort the elders among you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Tend ye the flock of God among you, watching over, not by obligation, but willingly, nor greedily, but readily,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">nor as domineering over the lots, but becoming examples of the flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the chief Shepherd is made known, ye will receive the unfading crown of glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Likewise younger men should be subordinate to the elder men. And all being subordinate to each other, clothe yourselves with humility, because God sets himself against the haughty, but gives grace to the lowly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore be lowered under the mighty hand of God, so that he may lift you up in time,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">having cast all your concern upon him, because he cares for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Be sober, be vigilant. Your opponent the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about seeking whom to devour.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And may the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus (after suffering a little while) himself thoroughly prepare you. He will establish, strengthen, and provide a foundation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Simon Peter, a bondman and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received an equally precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">as all things of his divine power to us, things toward life and piety, which were granted through the knowledge of him who called us through glory and virtue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Because of which, the precious and greatest promises have been given to us, so that through these ye might become companions of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption in the world in lust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now this same thing also, having applied all eagerness, furnish in your faith, virtue, and in virtue, knowledge,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and in knowledge, self-control, and in self-control, perseverance, and in perseverance, piety,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and in piety, brotherly affection, and in brotherly affection, love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For these things existing in you and abounding, it leads to not being idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For he in whom these things are not present is blind, being near-sighted, having deliberately forgotten the purification of his former sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore, brothers, instead be diligent to make your calling and selection sure, for doing these things, ye would, no, not ever stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For so the entrance will be furnished to you abundantly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore I will not neglect to always remind you about these things, although having known them, and having been established in the present truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But I think it right, inasmuch as I am in this tent, to arouse you in memory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Knowing that the putting off of my tent is imminent, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ indicated to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And also I will endeavor for you to always have, after my departure, the memory of these things to apply.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For we revealed to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, not men who followed in cunningly devised myths, but men who became eyewitnesses of the majesty of that man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For having received from God the Father honor and glory from a voice of such kind brought to him from the Majestic Glory, This is my Son, the beloved in whom I am well pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And we heard this voice, which was brought out of heaven, being with him on the holy mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And we have the prophetic word sure, to which ye do well giving heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the daystar arises in your hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture comes to pass of a personal interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For no prophecy was ever brought by a will of man, but holy men of God spoke, being led by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But false prophets also developed among the people, as false teachers will also be among you, who will sneak in pernicious denominations, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And many will follow their wantonness, because of whom the way of the truth will be blasphemed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they will exploit you in greed with fabricated words, whose judgment is not idle for long, and their destruction will not slumber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For if God did not spare agents who sinned, but delivered them up to chains of darkness, having been cast into hell being reserved for judgment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, the eighth, a herald of righteousness, when he brought on a flood upon the world of the irreverent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction, being reduced to ashes, having made an example of men who were going to be irreverent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and he rescued righteous Lot, being distressed by the conduct of the lawless in their licentiousness</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">(for that righteous man dwelling among them day after day, in the sight and hearing of their lawless deeds, it anguished his righteous soul),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">the Lord knows how to rescue the pious out of temptation, and to hold in reserve unrighteous men being cut off for a day of judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And especially those going rear of flesh in a degenerate lust, and who despise lordship. Reckless, self-willed men, they do not tremble when speaking evil of dignities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Whereas agents, being greater in might and power, do not bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But these men, like irrational beasts of nature, having been born for capture and destruction, speaking evil at which things they do not understand, will be destroyed in their corruption,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">getting back a wage of unrighteousness. Men who consider soft living in the daytime to be pleasure, spots and blemishes reveling in their deceitfulness, feasting together with you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">having eyes full of adultery, and unceasing sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, children of a curse,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">having forsaken a straight path, they were led astray, men who followed the way of Balaam, son of Beor, who loved the wage of unrighteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But he had a rebuke of his own lawbreaking. A mute donkey, uttering in a man's voice, restrained the madness of the prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These men are waterless wells, and clouds driven by a fierce wind, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved into an age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For, uttering swollen things of vanity, they entice (to sensuality by lusts of flesh) those who actually escaped from those who live in error,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">promising them freedom, while they themselves are bondmen of corruption, for by what any man has been overcome, of this he has also been enslaved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For if, having escaped the defilements of the world by knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and, having been again entangled in these, they are overcome, the last things have become worse for them than the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But that of the true proverb has happened to them, The dog returning to his own vomit, and the sow that washed to wallowing in mire.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Knowing this first, that there will come at the end of the days, scoffers, proceeding according to their own desires,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? For, from since the fathers became asleep, all things continue this way from the beginning of creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For this is willfully ignored by them, that long ago there were heavens, and an earth that came together out of water and by water by the word of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">by which the world then perished, having been overflowed with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But now the heavens and the earth, which have been stored up by the same word, are being preserved for fire in a day of judgment and destruction of irreverent men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But beloved, let not this one thing be ignored by you, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord is not slack about his promise, as some regard slackness, but is patient toward us, not wanting any to perish, but all to go forward to repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, during which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements, being intensely hot, will be disintegrated, and the earth and the works in it will be destroyed by fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore, all these things being disintegrated, what kind ought ye to be in holy actions and pieties,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">anticipating and hastening the coming of the day of God, by which the heavens, being made fiery hot, will be disintegrated, and the elements dissolve, being intensely hot?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we anticipate a new heavens and a new earth according to his promise, in which righteousness dwells.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore, beloved, anticipating these things, be diligent to be found by him in peace, without spot and blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And consider the longsuffering of our Lord, salvation, just as also our beloved brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">as also in all his letters, speaking in them about these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist, as also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Ye therefore, beloved, knowing in advance, keep watch, lest, having accommodated to the error of the lawless, ye fall from your own steadfastness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him is the glory both now and into the day of the age. Truly.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And we write these things to you, so that our joy may be made full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And this is the message that we have heard from him and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from every sin.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And by this we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">I wrote to you, fathers, because ye have know him from the beginning. I wrote to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And one of the seven agents who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the judgment of the great whore who sits upon the many waters</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">with whom the kings of the earth fornicated, and those who inhabit the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he carried me away in spirit into a wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast containing names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup containing abominations and the filthy things of her fornication,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the sanctified, and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And having seen her, I wondered with great amazement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the agent said to me, Why did thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The beast that thou saw was, and is not, and is going to ascend out of the abyss and go into destruction. And those who dwell on the earth will wonder, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and will come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Here is the mind that has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains where the woman sits on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And there are seven kings, the five are fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes he must remain a little while.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. And those with him are the called and chosen and faithful.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after these things I saw another agent coming down out of heaven having great authority, and the earth was illuminated from his glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he cried out in a mighty voice, saying, Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen, and became a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hated bird.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Because all the nations have drunk from the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the kings of the earth fornicated with her, and the merchants of the earth became rich from the power of her wantonness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out from her, my people, so that ye may not participate with her sins, and that ye may not receive from her plagues.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Because her sins have reached as far as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Render to her as she also rendered to you, and double to her two-fold according to her works. In the cup that she mixed, mix two-fold for her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In an amount she glorified herself and lived wantonly, give her so much torment and grief, because she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and will, no, not see grief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Because of this her plagues will come in one day, death, and grief, and famine. And she will be utterly burned with fire, because strong is the Lord, the God who judged her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the kings of the earth who fornicated and lived wantonly with her, will weep and will beat their breasts for her when they see the smoke of her burning,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And the fruit of the lust of thy soul have departed from thee. And all the fat and bright things are destroyed from thee. And thou will, no, not find them any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The merchants of these things who became rich from her will stand from afar because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and saying, Alas, alas, the great city, which was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Because in one hour such great wealth was devastated. And every shipmaster, and every man who sails anywhere, and sailors, and as many as work by sea, stood from afar</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and cried out seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What is like the great city?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they cast dust on their heads, and cried out, weeping and mourning, and saying, Alas, alas, the great city in which all who had ships in the sea became rich from her luxuriance! Because in one hour she was devastated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Be glad over her, thou heaven, and the sanctified, and the apostles, and the prophets, because God has decreed your judgment of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And one mighty agent took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus in violence Babylon the great city will be thrown down, and will, no, not be found any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And a sound of harpers and minstrels and flute-players and trumpeters will, no, not be heard in thee any more. And every craftsman of every craft will, no, not be found in thee any more. And a sound of a millstone will, no, not be heard in thee any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the light of a lamp will, no, not shine in thee any more. And a voice of a bridegroom and of a bride will, no, not be heard in thee any more. Because thy merchants were the chief men of the earth, because all the nations were led astray by thy enchantments.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And a second time they said, Praise the Lord! And the smoke of her ascended into the ages of the ages.</VERS>
