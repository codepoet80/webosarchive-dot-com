    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said, Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Damascus, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden; and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole people, to deliver them up to Edom:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon; and I will turn my hand against Ekron; and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole people to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">but I will send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they may enlarge their border.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Moab, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which their fathers did walk:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">they that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father go unto the [same] maiden, to profane my holy name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Behold, I will press [you] in your place, as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And flight shall perish from the swift; and the strong shall not strengthen his force; neither shall the mighty deliver himself;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver [himself]; neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hear this word that Jehovah hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Shall two walk together, except they have agreed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is [set] for him? shall a snare spring up from the ground, and have taken nothing at all?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Shall the trumpet be blown in a city, and the people not be afraid? shall evil befall a city, and Jehovah hath not done it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, except he reveal his secret unto his servants the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The lion hath roared; who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah hath spoken; who can but prophesy?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Publish ye in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold what great tumults are therein, and what oppressions in the midst thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For they know not to do right, saith Jehovah, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An adversary [there shall be], even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be plundered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Thus saith Jehovah: As the shepherd rescueth out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the children of Israel be rescued that sit in Samaria in the corner of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Hear ye, and testify against the house of Jacob, saith the Lord Jehovah, the God of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Beth-el; and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I will smite the winter-house with the summer-house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, that oppress the poor, that crush the needy, that say unto their lords, Bring, and let us drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that they shall take you away with hooks, and your residue with fish-hooks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And ye shall go out at the breaches, every one straight before her; and ye shall cast [yourselves] into Harmon, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Come to Beth-el, and transgress; to Gilgal, [and] multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, [and] your tithes every three days;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill-offerings and publish them: for this pleaseth you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places; yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I also have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest; and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water, and were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig-trees and your olive-trees hath the palmer-worm devoured: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have carried away your horses; and I have made the stench of your camp to come up even into your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I have overthrown [cities] among you, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a brand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel; [and] because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought; that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the Earth-jehovah, the God of hosts, is his name.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hear ye this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is cast down upon her land; there is none to raise her up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, to the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For thus saith Jehovah unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Beth-el.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Ye who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">[seek him] that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth (Jehovah is his name);</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">that bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong, so that destruction cometh upon the fortress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Forasmuch therefore as ye trample upon the poor, and take exactions from him of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink the wine thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins-ye that afflict the just, that take a bribe, and that turn aside the needy in the gate [from their right].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be with you, as ye say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all the broad ways; and they shall say in all the streets, Alas! Alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to wailing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And in all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! Wherefore would ye have the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Yea, though ye offer me your burnt-offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Yea, ye have borne the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith Jehovah, whose name is the God of hosts.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and to them that are secure in the mountain of Samaria, the notable men of the chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel come!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines: are they better than these kingdoms? or is their border greater than your border?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">-ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that sing idle songs to the sound of the viol; that invent for themselves instruments of music, like David;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">that drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief oils; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore shall they now go captive with the first that go captive; and the revelry of them that stretched themselves shall pass away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by himself, saith Jehovah, the God of hosts: I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces; therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when a man`s uncle shall take him up, even he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is in the innermost parts of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No; then shall he say, Hold thy peace; for we may not make mention of the name of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For, behold, Jehovah commandeth, and the great house shall be smitten with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow [there] with oxen? that ye have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">ye that rejoice in a thing of nought, that say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah, the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of the Arabah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king`s mowings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it came to pass that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jehovah repented concerning this: It shall not be, saith Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, the Lord Jehovah called to content by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said I, O Lord Jehovah, cease, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jehovah repented concerning this: this also shall not be, saith the Lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jehovah said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el; for it is the king`s sanctuary, and it is a royal house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet`s son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycomore-trees:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not [thy word] against the house of Isaac;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou thyself shalt die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, a basket of summer fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said Jehovah unto me, The end is come upon my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the songs of the temple shall be wailings in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah: the dead bodies shall be many: in every place shall they cast them forth with silence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Hear this, O ye that would swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">that we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jehovah hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? yea, it shall rise up wholly like the River; and it shall be troubled and sink again, like the River of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning for an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Behold, the days come, saith the Lord Jehovah, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of Jehovah, and shall not find it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, As thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, As the way of Beer-sheba liveth; they shall fall, and never rise up again.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I saw the Lord standing beside the altar: and he said, Smite the capitals, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Though they dig into Sheol, thence shall my hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, [is] he that toucheth the land and it melteth, and all that dwell therein shall mourn; and it shall rise up wholly like the River, and shall sink again, like the River of Egypt;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">[it is] he that buildeth his chambers in the heavens, and hath founded his vault upon the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; Jehovah is his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith Jehovah. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; save that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, The evil shall not overtake nor meet us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Jehovah sent out a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said unto them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, What is this that thou hast done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Wherefore they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We beseech thee, O Jehovah, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man`s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for thou, O Jehovah, hast done as it pleased thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the men feared Jehovah exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto Jehovah, and made vows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All thy waves and thy billows passed over me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes; Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days` journey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jonah began to enter into the city a day`s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he prayed unto Jehovah, and said, I pray thee, O Jehovah, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I hasted to flee unto Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore now, O Jehovah, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jehovah said, Doest thou well to be angry?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jehovah God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his evil case. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jehovah said, Thou hast had regard for the gourd, for which thou hast not labored, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Trust ye not in a neighbor; put ye not confidence in a friend; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man`s enemies are the men of his own house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be a light unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I will bear the indignation of Jehovah, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, [and] I shall behold his righteousness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I show unto them marvellous things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall come with fear unto Jehovah our God, and shall be afraid because of thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in lovingkindness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and as he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">He that hath ears, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this people`s heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Hear then ye the parable of the sower.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, [then] cometh the evil [one], and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown by the way side.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil [one];</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="51">Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="56">And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">On that day there came to him Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ye know that after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as he sat at meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For this [ointment] might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Jesus perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him [unto them.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now on the first [day] of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, [yet] will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and elders of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus said unto him, Friend, [do] that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="66">what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="73">And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art [one] of them; for thy speech maketh thee known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when morning was come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">saying, I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? see thou [to it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter`s field, to bury strangers in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore that field was called, the field of blood, unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom [certain] of the children of Israel did price;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and they gave them for the potter`s field, as the Lord appointed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then saith Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But the governor answered and said unto them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate saith unto them, What then shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; see ye [to it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all the people answered and said, His blood [be] on us, and on our children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then released he unto them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered unto him the whole band.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And they spat upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go [with them], that he might bear his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">and they sat and watched him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then are there crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">In like manner also the chief priests mocking [him], with the scribes and elders, said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusteth on God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And some of them stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And many women were there beholding from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And when even was come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus` disciple:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="61">And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Now on the morrow, which is [the day] after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said unto them, Ye have a guard: go, make it [as] sure as ye can.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now late on the sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as dead men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And if this come to the governor`s ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, [and continueth] until this day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; And they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And John was clothed with camel`s hair, and [had] a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I baptized you in water; But he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; And he was with the wild beasts; And the angels ministered unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And going on a little further, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they were astonished at his teaching: For he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now Simon`s wife`s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And all the city was gathered together at the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was noised that he was in the house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And they come, bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy, borne of four.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they could not come nigh unto him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Why doth this man thus speak? he blasphemeth: who can forgive sins but one, [even] God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And straightway Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, saith unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I say unto thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he arose, and straightway took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said unto them, Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and they that were with him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests, and gave also to them that were with him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And he spake to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was in the days of Herod, king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother`s womb.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And he charged him to tell no man: but go thy way, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But he withdrew himself in the deserts, and prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And behold, men bring on a bed a man that was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And not finding by what [way] they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Jesus perceiving their reasonings, answered and said unto them, Why reason ye in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he said unto him that was palsied), I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go unto thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And after these things he went forth, and beheld a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said unto him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Levi made him a great feast in his house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">And Jesus said unto them, Can ye make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But the days will come; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then will they fast in those days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he spake also a parable unto them: No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment; else he will rend the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And no man putteth new wine into old wine-skins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be spilled, and the skins will perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he knew that he was of Herod`s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they rehearsed the things [that happened] in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he took it, and ate before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Ye are witnesses of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And he led them out until [they were] over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and were continually in the temple, blessing God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The same was in the beginning with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He was not the light, but [came] that he might bear witness of the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There was the true light, [even the light] which lighteth every man, coming into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came unto his own, and they that were his own received him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God, [even] to them that believe on his name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become before me: for he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they had been sent from the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they asked him, and said unto him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">[even] he that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abideth thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">One of the two that heard John [speak], and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter`s brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and Jesus also was bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews` manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when [men] have drunk freely, [then] that which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and [his] brethren, and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers` money, and overthrew their tables;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and to them that sold the doves he said, Take these things hence; make not my Father`s house a house of merchandise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house shall eat me up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Jews therefore answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he spake of the temple of his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">the same came unto him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother`s womb, and be born?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven, [even] the Son of man, who is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And John also was baptizing in Enon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For John was not yet cast into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John`s disciples with a Jew about purifying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they came unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom`s voice: this my joy therefore is made full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He must increase, but I must decrease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to [this], that God is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he must needs pass through Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Jacob`s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus answered and said unto unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am [he].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Come, see a man, who told me all things that [ever] I did: can this be the Christ?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They went out of the city, and were coming to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him [aught] to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and [then] cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that [ever] I did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And many more believed because of his word;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought [him] that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So the father knew that [it was] at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep [gate] a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered, [waiting for the moving of the water.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">[for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole, with whatsoever disease he was holden.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time [in that case], he saith unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the sabbath on that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up [thy bed], and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh even until now, and I work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But the witness which I have is greater than [that of] John; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">As he spake these things, many believed on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, [then] are ye truly my disciples;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">They answered unto him, We are Abraham`s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Why do ye not understand my speech? [Even] because ye cannot hear my word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="48">The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Judas then, having received the band [of soldiers], and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am [he]. And Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore he said unto them, I am [he], they went backward, and fell to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus answered, I told you that I am [he]; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">that the word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest`s servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant`s name was Malchus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and [so did] another disciple. Now that disciple was known unto the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">but Peter was standing at the door without. So the other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went out and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The maid therefore that kept the door saith unto Peter, Art thou also [one] of this man`s disciples? He saith, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the servants and the officers were standing [there], having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Why askest thou me? Ask them that have heard [me], what I spake unto them: behold, these know the things which I said.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Peter therefore denied again: and straightway the cock crew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves entered not into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Pilate therefore went out unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye against this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They answered and said unto him, If this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find no crime in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.)</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And [Pilate] saith unto them, Behold, the man!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify [him], crucify [him]! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and he entered into the Praetorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar`s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They therefore cried out, Away with [him], away with [him], crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, [and] in Latin, [and] in Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother`s sister, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own [home].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high [day]), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave [him] leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">There then because of the Jews` Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now on the first [day] of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Simon Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and [that] he had said these things unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first [day] of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace [be] unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed [are] they that have not seen, and [yet] have believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus therefore saith unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he [said], I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, [even] Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way which thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the apostles and the brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">But Peter began, and expounded [the matter] unto them in order, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even unto me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">upon which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw the fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I heard also a voice saying unto me, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this was done thrice: and all were drawn up again into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And behold, forthwith three men stood before the house in which we were, having been sent from Caesarea unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the Spirit bade me go with them, making no distinction. And these six brethren also accompanied me; and we entered into the man`s house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose surname is Peter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">who shall speak unto thee words, whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If then God gave unto them the like gift as [he did] also unto us, when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They therefore that were scattered abroad upon the tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none save only to Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number that believed turned unto the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas as far as Antioch:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now about that time Herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. And [those] were the days of unleavened bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he had taken him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Peter therefore was kept in the prison: but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto God for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and guards before the door kept the prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell: and he smote Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he went out, and followed; and he knew not that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when they were past the first and the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and straightway the angel departed from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he had considered [the thing], he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together and were praying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a maid came to answer, named Rhoda.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when she knew Peter`s voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. And they said, It is his angel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him forth out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went to another place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and tarried there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now he was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: and they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king`s chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was fed from the king`s country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And upon a set day Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel, and sat on the throne, and made an oration unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the people shouted, [saying], The voice of a god, and not of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the word of God grew and multiplied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministration, taking with them John whose surname was Mark.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was [there], prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And as they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as their attendant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they had gone through the whole island unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. The same called unto him Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Saul, who is also [called] Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and said, O full of all guile and all villany, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm led he them forth out of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And for about the time of forty years as a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave [them] their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And afterward they asked for a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bare witness and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who shall do all My will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Of this man`s seed hath God according to promise brought unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us is the word of this salvation sent forth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And though they found no cause of death [in him], yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But God raised him from the dead:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">Because he saith also in another [psalm], Thou wilt not give Thy Holy One to see corruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="42">And as they went out, they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="46">And Paul and Barnabas spake out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">For so hath the Lord commanded us, [saying], I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, That thou shouldest be for salvation unto the uttermost part of       the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the Jews that were disobedient stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil affected against the brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Long time therefore they tarried [there] speaking boldly in the Lord, who bare witness unto the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the multitude of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when there was made an onset both of the Gentiles and of the Jews with their rulers, to treat them shamefully and to stone them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">they became aware of it, and fled unto the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the region round about:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and there they preached the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And at Lystra there sat a certain man, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother`s womb, who never had walked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The same heard Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the priest of Jupiter whose [temple] was before the city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the multitude, crying out</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good tidings, that ye should turn from these vain things unto a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and questioning with them, [the brethren] appointed that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They therefore, being brought on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And all the multitude kept silence; and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles through them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Symeon hath rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And after they had spent some time [there], they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">[But it seemed good unto Silas to abide there.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the Lord, [and see] how they fare.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">but Paul choose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and from thence to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a [Roman] colony: and we were in this city tarrying certain days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide [there]. And she constrained us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one`s bands were loosed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the jailor reported the words to Paul, [saying], The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? Nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the sergeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And they went out of the prison, and entered into [the house] of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and Paul, as his custom was, went in unto them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">opening and alleging that it behooved the Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom, [said he,] I proclaim unto you, is the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas, and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the Jews, being moved with jealousy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and gathering a crowd, set the city on an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them forth to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they found them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">whom Jason hath received: and these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, [one] Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Beroea: who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Many of them therefore believed; also of the Greek women of honorable estate, and of men, not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed of Paul at Beroea also, they came thither likewise, stirring up and troubling the multitudes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea: and Silas and Timothy abode there still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld the city full of idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he reasoned in the synagogue with Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with them that met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What would this babbler say? others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they took hold of him, and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, Ye men of Athens, in all things, I perceive that ye are very religious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The God that made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">neither is he served by men`s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined [their] appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee concerning this yet again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Thus Paul went out from among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But certain men clave unto him, and believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things he departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: and he came unto them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and because he was of the same trade, he abode with them, and they wrought, for by their trade they were tentmakers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook out his raiment and said unto them, Your blood [be] upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he departed thence, and went into the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Lord said unto Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy peace:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to harm thee: for I have much people in this city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he dwelt [there] a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment-seat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">saying, This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked villany, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves; I am not minded to be a judge of these matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he drove them from the judgment-seat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they all laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Paul, having tarried after this yet many days, took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila: having shorn his head in Cenchreae; for he had a vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when they asked him to abide a longer time, he consented not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but taking his leave of them, and saying, I will return again unto you if God will, he set sail from Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having spent some time [there], he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the scriptures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more accurately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he was come, he helped them much that had believed through grace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">for he powerfully confuted the Jews, [and that] publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and he said unto them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they [said] unto him, Nay, we did not so much as hear whether the Holy Spirit was [given].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John`s baptism.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him that should come after him, that is, on Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they were in all about twelve men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he entered into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading [as to] the things concerning the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this continued for the space of two years; so that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the evil spirits went out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the evil spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Many also of them that had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And not a few of them that practised magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So mightily grew the word of the Lord and prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now after these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And having sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And about that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought no little business unto the craftsmen;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this business we have our wealth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when they heard this they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the city was filled with the confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul`s companions in travel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when Paul was minded to enter in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent unto him and besought him not to adventure himself into the theatre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defense unto the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when the townclerk had quieted the multitude, he saith, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Diana, and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For ye have brought [hither] these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">If therefore Demetrius, and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if ye seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For indeed we are in danger to be accused concerning this day`s riot, there being no cause [for it]: and as touching it we shall not be able to give account of this concourse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after the uproar ceased, Paul having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he had gone through those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when he had spent three months [there,] and a plot was laid against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater of Beroea, [the son] of Pyrrhus; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But these had gone before, and were waiting for us at Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we tarried seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And upon the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the morrow; and prolonged his speech until midnight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there sat in the window a certain young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Make ye no ado; for his life is in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when he was gone up, and had broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they brought the lad alive, and were not a little comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we going before to the ship set sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, intending himself to go by land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And sailing from thence, we came the following day over against Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after we came to Miletus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to him the elders of the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you all the time,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">save that the Holy Spirit testifieth unto me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But I hold not my life of any account as dear unto myself, so that I may accomplish my course, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Wherefore I testify unto you this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">Take heed unto yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit hath made you bishops, to feed the church of the Lord which he purchased with his own blood.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul`s neck and kissed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken, that they should behold his face no more. And they brought him on his way unto the ship.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when it came to pass that were parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course unto Cos, and the next day unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and having found a ship crossing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unlade her burden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And having found the disciples, we tarried there seven days: and these said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when it came to pass that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey; and they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way till we were out of the city: and kneeling down on the beach, we prayed, and bade each other farewell;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and we went on board the ship, but they returned home again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And on the morrow we departed, and came unto Caesarea: and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now this man had four virgin daughters, who prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And as we tarried there some days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And coming to us, and taking Paul`s girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when we heard these things, both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Paul answered, What do ye, weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And after these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And there went with us also [certain] of the disciples from Caesarea, bringing [with them] one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when he had saluted them, he rehearsed one by one the things which God had wrought among the Gentiles through his ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they, when they heard it, glorified God; and they said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of them that have believed; and they are all zealous for the law:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What is it therefore? They will certainly hear that thou art come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men that have a vow on them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">these take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have been informed concerning thee; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But as touching the Gentiles that have believed, we wrote, giving judgment that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple, declaring the fulfilment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man that teacheth all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath defiled this holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and straightway the doors were shut.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And as they were seeking to kill him, tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in confusion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And forthwith he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, left off beating Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the chief captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith unto the chief captain, May I say something unto thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Art thou not then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But Paul said, I am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, give me leave to speak unto the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand unto the people; and when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, saying,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Brethren and fathers, hear ye the defence which I now make unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when they heard that he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, they were the more quiet: and he saith,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as ye all are this day:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and I persecuted this Way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and journeyed to Damascus to bring them also that were there unto Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and drew nigh unto Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they that were with me beheld indeed the light, but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me I came into Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">came unto me, and standing by me said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And in that very hour I looked up on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, The God of our fathers hath appointed thee to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For thou shalt be a witness for him unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem; because they will not receive of thee testimony concerning me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the garments of them that slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they gave him audience unto this word; and they lifted up their voice, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as they cried out, and threw off their garments, and cast dust into the air,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">the chief captain commanded him be brought into the castle, bidding that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the centurion heard it, he went to the chief captain and told him, saying, What art thou about to do? for this man is a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the chief captain came and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? And he said, Yea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this citizenship. And Paul said, But I am [a Roman] born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They then that were about to examine him straightway departed from him: and the chief captain also was afraid when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But on the morrow, desiring to know the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Paul, looking stedfastly on the council, said, Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: and sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God`s high priest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Paul said, I knew not, brethren, that he was high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees: touching the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the assembly was divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there arose a great clamor: and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: and what if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they were more than forty that made this conspiracy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore do ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would judge of his case more exactly: and we, before he comes near, are ready to slay him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Paul`s sister`s son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the castle and told Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Paul called unto him one of the centurions, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain; for he hath something to tell him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and saith, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and asked me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the chief captain took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that thou hast to tell me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down Paul tomorrow unto the council, as though thou wouldest inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Do not thou therefore yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink till they have slain him: and now are they ready, looking for the promise from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the chief captain let the young man go, charging him, Tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he called unto him two of the centurions, and said, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and [he bade them] provide beasts, that they might set Paul thereon, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he wrote a letter after this form:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix, greeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be slain of them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And desiring to know the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him down unto their council:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">whom I found to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when it was shown to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to thee forthwith, charging his accusers also to speak against him before thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">and they, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when he had read it, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I will hear thee fully, said he, when thine accusers also are come: and he commanded him to be kept in Herod`s palace.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and [with] an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by the providence evils are corrected for this nation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold: [and we would have judged him according to our law.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">[But the chief captain Lysias came, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">[commanding his accusers to come before thee.] from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defense:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but [there were] certain Jews from Asia--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they besought him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">asking a favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; laying a plot to kill him on the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Howbeit Festus answered, that Paul was kept in charge at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart [thither] shortly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let them therefore, saith he, that are of power among you go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, let them accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when he had tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and on the morrow he sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he was come, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood round about him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">while Paul said in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Paul said, I am standing before Caesar`s judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou also very well knowest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If then I am a wrong-doer, and have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if none of those things is [true] whereof these accuse me, no man can give me up unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed unto Caesar: unto Caesar shalt thou go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when certain days were passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and saluted Festus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And as they tarried there many days, Festus laid Paul`s case before the King, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed [me], asking for sentence against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When therefore they were come together here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I should send him to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Agrippa [said] unto Festus, I also could wish to hear the man myself. To-morrow, saith he, thou shalt hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they were entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye behold this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to write.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it seemeth to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not withal to signify the charges against him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defence:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I think myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before thee this day touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">especially because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">My manner of life then from my youth up, which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">having knowledge of me from the first, if they be willing to testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now I stand [here] to be judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">unto which [promise] our twelve tribes, earnestly serving [God] night and day, hope to attain. And concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Whereupon as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that journeyed with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but declared both to them of Damascus first and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judaea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For this cause the Jews seized me in the temple, and assayed to kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand unto this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">For the king knoweth of these things, unto whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this hath not been done in a corner.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And Agrippa [said] unto Paul, With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Paul [said], I would to God, that whether with little or with much, not thou only, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except these bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail unto the places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the next day we touched at Sidon: and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go unto his friends and refresh himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And putting to sea from thence, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, [a city] of Lycia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not further suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete, over against Salmone;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and with difficulty coasting along it we came unto a certain place called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul admonished them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to put to sea from thence, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter [there; which is] a haven of Crete, looking northeast and south-east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and when the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way [to it,] and were driven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and when they had hoisted it up, they used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And as we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw the [the freight] overboard;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when neither sun nor stars shone upon [us] for many days, and no small tempest lay on [us,] all hope that we should be saved was now taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when they had been long without food, then Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but [only] of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, whom also I serve,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">But we must be cast upon a certain island.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven to and fro in the [sea of] Adria, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and they sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Wherefore I beseech you to take some food: for this is for your safety: for there shall not a hair perish from the head of any of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he brake it, and began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then were they all of good cheer, and themselves also took food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But lighting upon a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence [of the waves].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the soldiers` counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any [of them] should swim out, and escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stayed them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and the rest, some on planks, and some on [other] things from the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to the land.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the barbarians showed us no common kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with [me]: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded [the matter,] testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if our righteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They have all turned aside, they are together become       unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not, so much as one:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Their feet are swift to shed blood;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Destruction and misery are in their ways;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the way of peace have they not known:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law [cometh] the knowledge of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">whom God set forth [to be] a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for the showing, [I say], of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Or is God [the God] of Jews only? is he not [the God] of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, hath found according to the flesh?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not toward God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what saith the scripture? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but as of debt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Even as David also pronounceth blessing upon the man, unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">[saying], Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, And whose sins are covered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Blessed is the man to whom, the Lord will not reckon sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say, To Abraham his faith was reckoned for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">How then was it reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision; that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned unto them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if they that are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">for the law worketh wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For this cause [it is] of faith, that [it may be] according to grace; to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">(as it is written, A father of many nations have I made thee) before him whom he believed, [even] God, who giveth life to the dead, and calleth the things that are not, as though they were.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So shall thy seed be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And without being weakened in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah`s womb;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">yet, looking unto the promise of God, he wavered not through unbelief, but waxed strong through faith, giving glory to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Wherefore also it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was reckoned unto him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but for our sake also, unto whom it shall be reckoned, who believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">through whom also we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand; and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And not only so, but we also rejoice in our tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh stedfastness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and stedfastness, approvedness; and approvedness, hope:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and hope putteth not to shame; because the love of God hath been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given unto us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For while we were yet weak, in due season Christ died for the ungodly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But God commendeth his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Much more then, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from the wrath [of God] through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned:--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">for until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam`s transgression, who is a figure of him that was to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But not as the trespass, so also [is] the free gift. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound unto the many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And not as through one that sinned, [so] is the gift: for the judgment [came] of one unto condemnation, but the free gift [came] of many trespasses unto justification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For if, by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; much more shall they that receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, [even] Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So then as through one trespass [the judgment came] unto all men to condemnation; even so through one act of righteousness [the free gift came] unto all men to justification of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For as through the one man`s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">that, as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We were buried therefore with him through baptism unto death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For if we have become united with [him] in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of his resurrection;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">knowing this, that our old man was crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">for he that hath died is justified from sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">neither present your members unto sin [as] instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves [as] servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members [as] servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members [as] servants to righteousness unto sanctification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Or are ye ignorant, brethren (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the husband while he liveth; but if the husband die, she is discharged from the law of the husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So then if, while the husband liveth, she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be joined to another man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, [even] to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but sin, finding occasion, wrought in me through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin [is] dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and the commandment, which [was] unto life, this I found [to be] unto death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">for sin, finding occasion, through the commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Did then that which is good become death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; --that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For that which I do I know not: for not what I would, that do I practise; but what I hate, that I do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if what I would not, that I do, I consent unto the law that it is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but to do that which is good [is] not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I practise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But if what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I of myself with the mind, indeed, serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For they that are after the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with [him], that we may be also glorified with [him].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for [our] adoption, [to wit], the redemption of our body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But if we hope for that which we see not, [then] do we with patience wait for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for [us] with groanings which cannot be uttered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to [the will of] God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And we know that to them that love God all things work together for good, [even] to them that are called according to [his] purpose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and whom he foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">What then shall we say to these things? If God [is] for us, who [is] against us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who shall lay anything to the charge of God`s elect? It is God that justifieth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Even as it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, called [to be] an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">unto the church of God which is at Corinth, [even] them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called [to be] saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their [Lord] and ours:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I thank my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that in everything ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">who shall also confirm you unto the end, [that ye be] unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God is faithful, through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing and [that] there be no divisions among you; but [that] ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For it hath been signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them [that are of the household] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now this I mean, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos: and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I thank God that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God`s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For behold your calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, [are called]:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose, [yea] and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">that no flesh should glory before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We speak wisdom, however, among them that are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nought:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but we speak God`s wisdom in a mystery, [even] the [wisdom] that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our glory:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">which none of the rulers of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">but as it is written, Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, And [which] entered not into the heart of man, Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But unto us God revealed [them] through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Which things also we speak, not in words which man`s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining spiritual things with spiritual [words].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able [to bear it]: nay, not even now are ye able;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we are God`s fellow-workers: ye are God`s husbandry, God`s building.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">each man`s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man`s work of what sort it is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If any man`s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If any man`s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and ye are Christ`s; and Christ is God`s.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let a man so account of us, as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man`s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his praise from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us ye might learn not [to go] beyond the things which are written; that no one of you be puffed up for the one against the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Already are ye filled, already ye are become rich, ye have come to reign without us: yea and I would that ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For, I think, God hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, both to angels and men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">We are fools for Christ`s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have glory, but we have dishonor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For though ye have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet [have ye] not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begat you through the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of them that are puffed up, but the power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one [of you] hath his father`s wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, [even] Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">not at all [meaning] with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I say [this] to move you to shame. What, cannot there be [found] among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that [your] brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up as through his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own;</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But unto the married I give charge, [yea] not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">(but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such [cases]: but God hath called us in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Was any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use [it] rather.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord`s freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ`s bondservant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, [namely,] that it is good for a man to be as he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">and is divided. [So] also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin [daughter], if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart, to keep his own virgin [daughter], shall do well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So then both he that giveth his own virgin [daughter] in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is [anything] in the world, and that there is no God but one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">by which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and last of all, as to the [child] untimely born, he appeared to me also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Whether then [it be] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yea, we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ`s, at his coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then [cometh] the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I protest by that glorifying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Awake to soberness righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak [this] to move you to shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one [flesh] of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the [glory] of the terrestrial is another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [body].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam [became] a life-giving spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not all [his] will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let all that ye do be done in love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they supplied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema. Maranatha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="47" bname="2 Corinthians" bsname="2Cor">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction, through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For as the sufferings of Christ abound unto us, even so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and our hope for you is stedfast; knowing that, as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of the comfort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which befell [us] in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, insomuch that we despaired even of life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">yea, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver: on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For our glorifying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For we write no other things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge, and I hope ye will acknowledge unto the end:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that we are your glorying, even as ye also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And in this confidence I was minded to come first unto you, that ye might have a second benefit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and of you to be set forward on my journey unto Judaea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When I therefore was thus minded, did I show fickleness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yea and nay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, [even] by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him is yea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For how many soever be the promises of God, in him is the yea: wherefore also through him is the Amen, unto the glory of God through us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now he that establisheth us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">who also sealed us, and gave [us] the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I forbare to come unto Corinth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for in faith ye stand fast.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was [inflicted] by the many;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore I beseech you to confirm [your] love toward him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But to whom ye forgive anything, I [forgive] also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes [have I forgiven it] in the presence of Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables [that are] hearts of flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if the ministration of death, written, [and] engraven on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which [glory] was passing away:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if that which passeth away [was] with glory, much more that which remaineth [is] in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and [are] not as Moses, [who] put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth, it not being revealed [to them] that it is done away in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But unto this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, [there] is liberty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we faint not:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man`s conscience in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in them that perish:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn [upon them].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus` sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Seeing it is God, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">[we are] pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, yet not unto despair;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">pursued, yet not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus` sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then death worketh in us, but life in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore did I speak; we also believe, and therefore also we speak;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">knowing that he that raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also with Jesus, and shall present us with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For all things [are] for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound unto the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Wherefore we faint not; but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For our light affliction, which is for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">(for we walk by faith, not by sight);</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things [done] in the body, according to what he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but [speak] as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and he died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know [him so] no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Wherefore if any man is in Christ, [he is] a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beseech [you] on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Him who knew no sin he made [to be] sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And working together [with him] we entreat also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(for he saith, At an acceptable time I hearkened unto thee, And in a day of salvation did I succor thee:     behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation):</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but in everything commending ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But now complete the doing also; that as [there was] the readiness to will, so [there may be] the completion also out of your ability.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">only [they would] that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, because it was not united by faith with them that heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we who have believed do enter into that rest; even as he hath said, As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest:     although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For he hath said somewhere of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and in this [place] again, They shall not enter into my rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">he again defineth a certain day, To-day, saying in David so long a time afterward (even as hath been said before), To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Having then a great high priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help [us] in time of need.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and by reason thereof is bound, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And no man taketh the honor unto himself, but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Christ also glorified not himself to be made a high priest, but he that spake unto him, Thou art my Son, This day have I begotten thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">as he saith also in another [place,] Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and having been made perfect, he became unto all them that obey him the author of eternal salvation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">named of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Of whom we have many things to say, and hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become dull of hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For when by reason of the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need again that some one teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For every one that partaketh of milk is without experience of the word of righteousness; for he is a babe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But solid food is for fullgrown men, [even] those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Wherefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on unto perfection; not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">of the teaching of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And this will we do, if God permit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and [then] fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receiveth blessing from God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but if it beareth thorns and thistles, it is rejected and nigh unto a curse; whose end is to be burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye showed toward his name, in that ye ministered unto the saints, and still do minister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he sware by himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For men swear by the greater: and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Wherein God, being minded to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">which we have as an anchor of the soul, [a hope] both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">whither as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God), abideth a priest continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priest`s office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of Abraham, and hath blessed him that hath the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And here men that die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what further need [was there] that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given attendance at the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And [what we say] is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for it is witnessed [of him,] Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And inasmuch as [it is] not without the taking of an oath</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him, The Lord sware and will not repent himself, Thou art a priest for ever);</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the [sins] of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, [appointeth] a Son, perfected for evermore.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now in the things which we are saying the chief point [is this]: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this [high priest] also have somewhat to offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">who serve [that which is] a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned [of God] when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and       with the house of Judah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Not according to the covenant that I made with their       fathers In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out       of the land of Egypt; For they continued not in my covenant, And I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For this is the covenant that I will make with the house       of Israel After those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, And on their heart also will I write them: And I will be to them a God, And they shall be to me a people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: For all shall know me, From the least to the greatest of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I will be merciful to their iniquities, And their sins will I remember no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In that he saith, A new [covenant] he hath made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now even a first [covenant] had ordinances of divine service, and its sanctuary, [a sanctuary] of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, wherein [were] the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the Holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein [was] a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron`s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak severally.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the errors of the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">the Holy Spirit this signifying, that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">which [is] a figure for the time present; according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot, as touching the conscience, make the worshipper perfect,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">[being] only (with meats and drinks and divers washings) carnal ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Christ having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled, sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish unto God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For where a testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him that made it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For a testament is of force where there hath been death: for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Wherefore even the first [covenant] hath not been dedicated without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses unto all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded to you-ward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And according to the law, I may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this [cometh] judgment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, apart from sin, to them that wait for him, unto salvation.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For the law having a shadow of the good [things] to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect them that draw nigh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Else would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But in those [sacrifices] there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, But a body didst thou prepare for me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In whole burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou       hadst no pleasure:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then said I, Lo, I am come (In the roll of the book it is       written of me) To do thy will, O God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">then hath he said, Lo, I am come to do thy will. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never take away sins:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the Holy Spirit also beareth witness to us; for after he hath said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws on their heart, And upon their mind also will I write them;     [then saith he,]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no       more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and [having] a great priest over the house of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and having our body washed with pure water,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting [one another]; and so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">A man that hath set at nought Moses law dieth without compassion on [the word of] two or three witnesses:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partakers with them that were so used.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For ye both had compassion on them that were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of you possessions, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Cast not away therefore your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For yet a very little while, He that cometh shall come, and shall not tarry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But my righteous one shall live by faith: And if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now faith is assurance of [things] hoped for, a conviction of things not seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For therein the elders had witness borne to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">By faith we understand that the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out of things which appear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness in respect of his gifts: and through it he being dead yet speaketh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him: for he hath had witness borne to him that before his translation he had been well-pleasing unto God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing [unto him]; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that seek after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">By faith Noah, being warned [of God] concerning things not seen as yet, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Confess therefore your sins one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Elijah was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he prayed again; and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My brethren, if any among you err from the truth, and one convert him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">let him know, that he who converteth a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">To whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto you, did they minister these things, which now have been announced unto you through them that preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven; which things angel desire to look into.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Because it is contained in scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">But ye are a elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for [God`s] own possession, that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lust, which war against the soul;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">having your behavior seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Servants, [be] in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered threatened not; but committed [himself] to him that judgeth righteously:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And let him turn away from evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears unto their supplication: But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:</VERS>
