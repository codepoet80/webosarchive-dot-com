    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God`s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. There was evening and there was morning, one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse, and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">God called the expanse sky. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear," and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God said, "Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth," and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There was evening and there was morning, a third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth," and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">God created the large sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind," and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">God created man in his own image. In God`s image he created him; male and female he created them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">God blessed them. God said to them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food." And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">On the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work which he had created and made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made earth and the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became four heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of the first is Pishon: this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and the gold of that land is good. There is aromatic resin and the onyx stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The name of the second river is Gihon: the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The name of the third river is Hiddekel: this is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yahweh God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He made the rib, which Yahweh God had taken from the man, into a woman, and brought her to the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The man said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, "Yes, has God said, `You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The woman said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, `You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The serpent said to the woman, "You won`t surely die,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be as God, knowing good and evil."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit of it, and ate; and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Both of their eyes were opened, and they knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The man said, "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yahweh God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?"     The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Yahweh God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all cattle, and above every animal of the field. On your belly shall you go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. In pain you will bring forth children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">To Adam he said, "Because you have listened to your wife`s voice, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, `You shall not eat of it,` cursed is the ground for your sake. In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thorns also and thistles will it bring forth to you; and you will eat the herb of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">By the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For you are dust, and to dust you shall return."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The man called his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yahweh God made coats of skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Yahweh God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he put forth his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever..."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore Yahweh God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So he drove out the man; and he placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The man knew Eve his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said, "I have gotten a man with Yahweh`s help."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Again she gave birth, to Cain`s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">As time passed, it happened that Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat of it. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but he didn`t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yahweh said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If you do well, will it not be lifted up? If you don`t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Cain said to Abel, his brother, "Let`s go into the field." It happened, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yahweh said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?"     He said, "I don`t know. Am I my brother`s keeper?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yahweh said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother`s blood cries to me from the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother`s blood from your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">From now on, when you till the ground, it won`t yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. It will happen that whoever finds me will kill me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yahweh said to him, "Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should strike him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Cain went out from Yahweh`s presence, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">To Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Lamech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">His brother`s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. Tubal-Cain`s sister was Naamah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice,    You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, For I have slain a man for wounding me,    A young man for bruising me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If Cain will be avenged seven times,    Truly Lamech seventy-seven times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth. For, she said, "God has appointed me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">There was also born a son to Seth, and he named him Enosh. Then men began to call on Yahweh`s name.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sarah said, "God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">She said, "Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The child grew, and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore she said to Abraham, "Cast out this handmaid and her son! For the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The thing was very grievous in Abraham`s sight on account of his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">God said to Abraham, "Don`t let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your handmaid. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For from Isaac will your seed be called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is your seed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, "Don`t let me see the death of the child." She sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">God heard the voice of the boy.     The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, "What ails you, Hagar? Don`t be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand. For I will make him a great nation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the bottle with water, and gave the boy drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">It happened at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in all that you do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son`s son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have sojourned."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Abraham said, "I will swear."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech`s servants had violently taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Abimelech said, I don`t know who has done this thing. Neither did you tell me, neither did I hear of it, until today."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Abimelech said to Abraham, "What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because they both swore there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, "Abraham!"     He said, "Here I am."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said, "Now take your son, your only son, whom you love, even Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go yonder. We will worship, and come back to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, "My father?"     He said, "Here I am, my son."     He said, "Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Abraham said, "God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son." So they both went together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The angel of Yahweh called to him out of the sky, and said, "Abraham, Abraham!"     He said, "Here I am."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said, "Don`t lay your hand on the boy, neither do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh-jireh. As it is said to this day, "In Yahweh`s mountain it will be provided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The angel of Yahweh called to Abraham a second time out of the sky,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and said, "I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">that in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is on the seashore. Your seed will possess the gate of his enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">It happened after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, "Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham`s brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bare Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years. These were the years of Sarah`s life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. In the choice of our tombs bury your dead. None of us will withhold from you his tomb, but that you may bury your dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He talked with them, saying, "If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a burying-place."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, "But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants` standard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border of it round about, were made sure</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Abraham was old, and well stricken in age. Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, "Please put your hand under my thigh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The servant said to him, "What if the woman isn`t willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Abraham said to him, "Beware that you don`t bring my son there again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father`s house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, `To your descendants I will give this land.` He will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If the woman isn`t willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath. Only you shall not bring my son there again."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The servant took ten camels, of his master`s camels, and departed, having all goodly things of his master`s in his hand. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said, "Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, `Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink.` She will say, `Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.` Let the same be she who you have appointed for your servant Isaac. Thereby will I know that you have showed kindness to my master."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It happened, before he had done speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham`s brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin, neither had any man known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The servant ran to meet her, and said, "Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She said, "Drink, my lord." She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When she had done giving him drink, she said, "I will also draw for your camels, until they have done drinking."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The man looked steadfastly at her, holding his peace, to know whether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">It happened, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and said, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father`s house for us to lodge in?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">She said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">She said moreover to him, "We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The man bowed his head, and worshipped Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me in the way to the house of my master`s relatives."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The young lady ran, and told her mother`s house about these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">It happened, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister`s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, "This is what the man said to me," that he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He said, "Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Food was set before him to eat. But he said, "I will not eat until I have told my message."     He said, "Speak on."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He said, "I am Abraham`s servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Yahweh has blessed my master greatly. He has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and donkeys.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Sarah, my master`s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">My master made me swear, saying, `You shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">but you shall go to my father`s house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">I said to my master, `What if the woman will not follow me?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He said to me, `Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son of my relatives, and of my father`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then will you be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don`t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">I came this day to the spring, and said, `Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes forth to draw, to whom I will say, Give me, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">She will tell me, "Drink, and I will also draw for your camels." Let the same be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master`s son.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, `Please let me drink.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, `Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.` So I drank, and she made the camels drink also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">I asked her, and said, `Whose daughter are you?` She said, `The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor`s son, whom Milcah bare to him.` I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">I bowed my head, and worshipped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master`s brother`s daughter for his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me. That I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Then Laban and Bethuel answered, "The thing proceeds from Yahweh. We can`t speak to you bad or good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Behold, Rebekah is before you, take her, and go, and let her be your master`s son`s wife, as Yahweh has spoken."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">It happened that when Abraham`s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">The servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up in the morning, and he said, "Send me away to my master."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Her brother and her mother said, "Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will go."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">He said to them, "Don`t hinder me, seeing Yahweh has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">They said, "We will call the young lady, and ask her."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">They called Rebekah, and said to her, "Will you go with this man?"     She said, "I will go."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham`s servant, and his men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, "Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Rebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi. For he lived in the land of the South.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">She said to the servant, "Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?"     The servant said, "It is my master."     She took her veil, and covered herself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah`s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. He loved her. Isaac was comforted after his mother`s death.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Esau said to Jacob, "Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished." Therefore his name was called Edom.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Yahweh appeared to him, and said, "Don`t go down into Egypt. Dwell in the land which I will tell you of.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will give to your seed all these lands. In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Isaac lived in Gerar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "My wife," lest, he thought, the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she was beautiful to look on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It happened, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Abimelech called Isaac, and said, "Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, `She is my sister?`"     Isaac said to him, "Because I said, `Lest I die because of her.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Abimelech charged all the people, saying, "He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. Yahweh blessed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now all the wells which his father`s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go from us, for you are much mightier than we."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Isaac`s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac`s herdsmen, saying, "The water is ours." He called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. He called the name of it Sitnah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He left that place, and dug another well. They didn`t argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth. He said, "For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He went up from there to Beersheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Yahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, "I am the God of Abraham your father. Don`t be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham`s sake."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He built an altar there, and called on the name of Yahweh, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac`s servants dug a well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They said, "We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you. We said, `Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.` You are now the blessed of Yahweh."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He made them a feast, and they ate and drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They rose up some time in the morning, and swore one to another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">It happened the same day, that Isaac`s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, "We have found water."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, "My son?"     He said to him, "Here I am."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">His mother said to him, "Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He came to his father, and said, "My father?"     He said, "Here I am. Who are you, my son?"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, "The voice is Jacob`s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He didn`t recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau`s hands. So he blessed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He said, "Are you really my son Esau?"     He said, "I am."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He said, "Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son`s venison, that my soul may bless you."     He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">It happened, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, "Let my father arise, and eat of his son`s venison, that your soul may bless me."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father, "Bless me, even me also, my father."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He said, "Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He said, "Isn`t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing." He said, "Haven`t you reserved a blessing for me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Isaac answered Esau, "Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants. With grain and new wine have I sustained him. What then will I do for you, my son?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Esau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father." Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Isaac his father answered him, "Behold, of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling, and of the dew of the sky from above.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">It happened, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go: for you know my service with which I have served you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Laban said to him, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He said, "Appoint me your wages, and I will give it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He said to him, "You know how I have served you, and how your cattle have fared with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He said, "What shall I give you?"     Jacob said, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Everyone that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be counted stolen."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Laban said, "Behold, I desire it to be according to your word."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He set three days` journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban`s flocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane-tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and didn`t put them into Laban`s flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">It happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">but when the flock were feeble, he didn`t put them in. So the feebler were Laban`s, and the stronger Jacob`s.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and donkeys.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="31">
      <VERS vnumber="1">He heard the words of Laban`s sons, saying, "Jacob has taken away all that was our father`s. From that which was our father`s, has he gotten all this wealth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jacob saw the expression on Laban`s face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yahweh said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and said to them, "I see the expression on your father`s face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You know that I have served your father with all of my strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn`t allow him to hurt me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If he said this, `The speckled will be your wages,` then all the flock bore speckled. If he said this, `The streaked will be your wages,` then all the flock bore streaked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">It happened at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The angel of God said to me in the dream, `Jacob,` and I said, `Here I am.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said, `Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Rachel and Leah answered him, "Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father`s house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Aren`t we accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children`s. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father to the land of Canaan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father`s.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn`t tell him that he was running away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He took his relatives with him, and pursued after him seven days` journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Take heed to yourself that you don`t speak to Jacob either good or bad."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn`t tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and didn`t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, `Take heed to yourself that you don`t speak to Jacob either good or bad.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now, you want to be gone, because you sore longed after your father`s house, but why have you stolen my gods?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jacob answered Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I said, `Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">With whoever you find your gods, he shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it." For Jacob didn`t know that Rachel had stolen them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Laban went into Jacob`s tent, into Leah`s tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he didn`t find them. He went out of Leah`s tent, and entered into Rachel`s tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel`s saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt about all the tent, but didn`t find them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">She said to her father, "Don`t let my lord be angry that I can`t rise up before you; for the manner of women is on me." He searched, but didn`t find the teraphim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, "What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">These twenty years have I been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven`t eaten the rams of your flocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">That which was torn of animals, I didn`t bring to you. I bore the loss of it. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">These twenty years have I been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Laban answered Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Jacob said to his relatives, "Gather stones." They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Laban said, "This heap is witness between me and you this day." Therefore it was named Galeed</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">and Mizpah, for he said, "Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">If you will afflict my daughters, and if you will take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="32">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When he saw them, Jacob said, "This is God`s host." He called the name of that place Mahanaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He commanded them, saying, "This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: `This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, men-servants, and maid-servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau. Not only that, but he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and he said, "If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jacob said, "God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, `Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers with the children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You said, `I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which can`t be numbered because there are so many.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He lodged there that night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau, his brother:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty she-donkeys and ten foals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He commanded the foremost, saying, "When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, `Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then you shall say, `They are your servant, Jacob`s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, "This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You shall say, `Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.`" For, he said, "I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When he saw that he didn`t prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob`s thigh was strained, as he wrestled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The man said, "Let me go, for the day breaks."     Jacob said, "I won`t let you go, unless you bless me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He said to him, "What is your name?"     He said, "Jacob."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He said, "Your name will no longer be called `Jacob,` but, `Israel,` for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name."     He said, "Why is it that you ask what my name is?" He blessed him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, he said, "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Therefore the children of Israel don`t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob`s thigh in the sinew of the hip.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="33">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and to the two handmaids.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He put the handmaids and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, "Who are these with you?"     He said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the handmaids came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Esau said, "What do you mean by all this company which I met?"     Jacob said, "To find favor in the sight of my lord."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Esau said, "I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jacob said, "Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Please take the gift that I brought to you; because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough." He urged him, and he took it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Esau said, "Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Please let my lord pass over before his servant: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Esau said, "Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me."     He said, "Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jacob journeyed to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his cattle. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob`s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, "I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In the uppermost basket there was of all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">It happened the third day, which was Pharaoh`s birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="41">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, well-favored and fat-fleshed, and they fed in the reed-grass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The ill-favored and lean-fleshed cattle ate up the seven well-favored and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up on one stalk, rank and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men of it. Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then the chief butler spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I remember my faults today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">We dreamed a dream in one night, I and he. We dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. To each man according to his dream he did interpret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">It happened, as he interpreted to us, so it was: me he restored to my office, and him he hanged."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, "It isn`t in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, "In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and, behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, fat-fleshed and well-favored. They fed in the reed-grass,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and, behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The lean and ill-favored cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and when they had eaten them up, it couldn`t be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. I told it to the magicians; but there was no one who could explain it to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years. The dream is one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The seven lean and ill-favored cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has showed to Pharaoh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">There will arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt`s produce in the seven plenteous years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; that the land not perish through the famine."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Because God has showed you all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">You shall be over my house, and according to your word will all my people be ruled. Only in the throne I will be greater than you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph`s hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before him, "Bow the knee!" He set him over all the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Pharaoh called Joseph`s name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">In the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, he laid up in the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, "For," he said, "God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father`s house."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The name of the second, he called Ephraim: "For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">The seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="42">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, "Why do you look at one another?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Joseph`s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Jacob didn`t send Benjamin, Joseph`s brother, with his brothers; for he said, "Lest perhaps harm befall him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph`s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, "Where did you come from?"     They said, "From the land of Canaan to buy food."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn`t recognize him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging-place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He said to his brothers, "My money is restored! Behold, it is even in my sack." Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">He said to the people, "Be ready by the third day. Don`t have sexual relations with a woman."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It happened on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yahweh said to Moses, "Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">You shall put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bull and the two rams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of meeting, and shall wash them with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the coat, the robe of the ephod, the ephod, and the breastplate, and dress him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and you shall set the turban on his head, and put the holy crown on the turban.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then you shall take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You shall bring his sons, and put coats on them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">But the flesh of the bull, and its skin, and its dung, you shall burn with fire outside of the camp: it is a sin-offering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"You shall also take the one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">You shall kill the ram, and you shall take its blood, and sprinkle it around on the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You shall cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its innards, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">You shall burn the whole ram on the altar: it is a burnt offering to Yahweh; it is a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">"You shall take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then you shall kill the ram, and take some of its blood, and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You shall take of the blood that is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be made holy, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons` garments with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Also you shall take some of the ram`s fat, the fat tail, the fat that covers the innards, the cover of the liver, the two kidneys, the fat that is on them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of consecration),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and one loaf of bread, one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">You shall put all of this in Aaron`s hands, and in his sons` hands, and shall wave them for a wave-offering before Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">You shall take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar on the burnt offering, for a sweet savor before Yahweh: it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">"You shall take the breast of Aaron`s ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave-offering before Yahweh: and it shall be your portion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">You shall sanctify the breast of the wave-offering, and the thigh of the heave-offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as their portion forever from the children of Israel; for it is a heave-offering: and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, even their heave-offering to Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">"The holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Seven days shall the son who is priest in his place put them on, when he comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">"You shall take the ram of consecration, and boil its flesh in a holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They shall eat those things with which atonement was made, to consecrate and sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat of it, because they are holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">If anything of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remains to the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">"Thus shall you do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded you. Seven days shall you consecrate them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Every day shall you offer the bull of sin-offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when you make atonement for it; and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar shall be most holy; whatever touches the altar shall be holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">"Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer at evening:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">"You shall also make a basin of brass, and the base of it of brass, in which to wash. You shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="31">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="32">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, "Come, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don`t know what has become of him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Aaron said to them, "Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He received what they handed him, and fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said, "These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Go, get down; for your people, who you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, `These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yahweh said to Moses, "I have seen these people, and, behold, they are a stiff-necked people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moses begged Yahweh his God, and said, "Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, `He brought them forth for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?` Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, `I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed, and they shall inherit it forever.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Yahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other they were written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is the noise of war in the camp."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, "It isn`t the voice of those who shout for victory, neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It happened, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses` anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Aaron said, "Don`t let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For they said to me, `Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don`t know what has become of him.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I said to them, `Whoever has any gold, let them take it off:` so they gave it me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When Moses saw that the people had broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is on Yahweh`s side, come to me!"     All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He said to them, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, `Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Moses said, "Consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh, yes, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">It happened on the next day, that Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin. Now I will go up to Yahweh. Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, "Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Yet now, if you will, forgive their sin-- and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have written."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Yahweh said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Yahweh struck the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="33">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Depart, go up from here, you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, `I will give it to your seed.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">to a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you in the way."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the people heard this evil news, they mourned: and no one put on his jewelry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell the children of Israel, `You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go up into your midst for one moment, I would consume you. Therefore now take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it "The tent of meeting." It happened that everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It happened that when Moses went out to the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until he had gone into the Tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It happened, when Moses entered into the Tent, that the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and spoke with Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshipped, everyone at their tent door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, didn`t depart out of the Tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Moses said to Yahweh, "Behold, you tell me, `Bring up this people:` and you haven`t let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, `I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said to him, "If your presence doesn`t go with me, don`t carry us up from here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Isn`t it in that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who are on the surface of the earth?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Yahweh said to Moses, "I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, "Please show me your glory."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said, "You cannot see my face, for man may not see me and live."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yahweh also said, "Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on the rock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">It will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back; but my face shall not be seen."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="34">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh said to Moses, "Chisel two stone tablets like the first: and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have lived long enough in this mountain:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and to all [the places] near thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Yahweh, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Take wise men of understanding and well known according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken is good [for us] to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner who is with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God`s: and the cause that is too hard for you you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">We journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">You came near to me everyone of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">They took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Yet you wouldn`t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and you murmured in your tents, and said, Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Where are we going up? our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to the sky; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">Yet in this thing you didn`t believe Yahweh your God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Yahweh heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">save Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he has trodden on, and to his children, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also shall not go in there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there: encourage you him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Moreover your little ones, whom you said should be a prey, and your children, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against Yahweh, we will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us. You girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Yahweh said to me, Tell them, Don`t go up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">So I spoke to you, and you didn`t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The Amorites, who lived in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">You returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn`t listen to your voice, nor gave ear to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">So you abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you abode [there].</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we compassed Mount Seir many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Command you the people, saying, You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take good heed to yourselves therefore;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">don`t contend with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You shall purchase food of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand; he has known your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years Yahweh your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yahweh said to me, Don`t bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">(The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Horites also lived in Seir before, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. We went over the brook Zered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So it happened, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">that Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and when you come near over against the children of Ammon, don`t bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">as he did for the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn`t give you this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Remember, don`t forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come you up out of the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">It happened, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh were come up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests` feet were lifted up to the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks, as before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then you shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until you were passed over, as Yahweh your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were passed over;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh, that it is mighty; that you may fear Yahweh your God forever.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how that Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">At that time Yahweh said to Joshua, Make you flint knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">This is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people who came forth out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, even the men of war who came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they didn`t listen to the voice of Yahweh: to whom Yahweh swore that he wouldn`t let them see the land which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Their children, whom he raised up in their place, them did Joshua circumcise: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It happened, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they abode in their places in the camp, until they were whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yahweh said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They ate of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, in the same day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said, No; but [as] prince of the host of Yahweh am I now come. Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said to him, What says my lord to his servant?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The prince of Yahweh`s host said to Joshua, Put off your shoe from off your foot; for the place whereon you stand is holy. Joshua did so.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Yahweh said to Joshua, Behold, I have given into your hand Jericho, and the king of it, and the mighty men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shall you do six days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams` horns before the ark: and the seventh day you shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram`s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams` horns before the ark of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They said to the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams` horns before Yahweh passed on, and blew the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Joshua commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall you shout.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So he caused the ark of Yahweh to compass the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams` horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of Yahweh, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It happened on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on the day they compassed the city seven times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It happened at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout; for Yahweh has given you the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to Yahweh: only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so would you make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy to Yahweh: they shall come into the treasury of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the people shouted, and [the priests] blew the trumpets; and it happened, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the prostitute`s house, and bring out there the woman, and all that she has, as you swore to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all that she had; all her relatives also they brought out; and they set them outside of the camp of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Rahab the prostitute, and her father`s household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she lived in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Yahweh, that rises up and builds this city Jericho: with the loss of his firstborn shall he lay the foundation of it, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing: and the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. The men went up and spied out Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They returned to Joshua, and said to him, Don`t let all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai; don`t make all the people to toil there; for they are but few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So there went up there of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The men of Ai struck of them about thirty-six men; and they chased them [from] before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Joshua said, Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what will you do for your great name?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yahweh said to Joshua, Get you up; why are you thus fallen on your face?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Israel has sinned; yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yes, they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore the children of Israel can`t stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except you destroy the devoted thing from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, There is a devoted thing in the midst of you, Israel; you can not stand before your enemies, until you take away the devoted thing from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which Yahweh takes shall come near by families; and the family which Yahweh shall take shall come near by households; and the household which Yahweh shall take shall come near man by man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has done folly in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Joshua said to Achan, My son, please give glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; don`t hide it from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonian mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel; and they laid them down before Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? Yahweh shall trouble you this day. All Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They raised over him a great heap of stones, to this day; and Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called "The valley of Achor" to this day.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh said to Joshua, Don`t be afraid, neither be you dismayed: take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai; behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king: only the spoil of it, and the cattle of it, shall you take for a prey to yourselves: set you an ambush for the city behind it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He commanded them, saying, Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; don`t go very far from the city, but be you all ready:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city. It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and they will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: so we will flee before them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city: for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set the city on fire; according to the word of Yahweh shall you do: behold, I have commanded you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Joshua sent them forth; and they went to set up the ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All the people, [even] the [men of] war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between him and Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they set the people, even all the host who was on the north of the city, and their liers-in-wait who were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">It happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he didn`t know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">All the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">There was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, who didn`t go out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yahweh said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand. Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hurried and set the city on fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people who fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and killed the men of Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The others came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">It happened, when Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For Joshua didn`t draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves, according to the word of Yahweh which he commanded Joshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the evening: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones, on which no man had lifted up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings to Yahweh, and sacrificed peace-offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">All Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, as well the sojourner as the native; half of them in front of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua didn`t read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who were among them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">Gideon said to God, Don`t let your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: Please let me make a trial just this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod: and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Yahweh said to Gideon, The people who are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand has saved me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead. There returned of the people twenty-two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yahweh said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for you there: and it shall be, that of whom I tell you, This shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whoever I tell you, This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he brought down the people to the water: and Yahweh said to Gideon, Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him shall you set by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yahweh said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand; and let all the people go every man to his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to him, Arise, get you down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if you fear to go down, go you with Purah your servant down to the camp:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall your hands be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is on the sea-shore for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow; and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream; and, behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">His fellow answered, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand God has delivered Midian, and all the host.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation of it, that he worshipped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Yahweh has delivered into your hand the host of Midian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He said to them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall you do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For Yahweh and for Gideon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So Gideon, and the hundred men who were with him, came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow; and they cried, The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and put [them] to flight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every man`s sword against his fellow, and against all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you didn`t call us, when you went to fight with Midian? They did chide with him sharply.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said to them, What have I now done in comparison with you? Isn`t the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Gideon came to the Jordan, [and] passed over, he, and the three hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He said to the men of Succoth, Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Gideon said, Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the host of the children of the east; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the host; for the host was secure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and confused all the host.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders of it, seventy-seven men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He came to the men of Succoth, and said, See Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you did taunt me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom you killed at Tabor? They answered, As you are, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother: as Yahweh lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said to Jether his firstborn, Up, and kill them. But the youth didn`t draw his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall on us; for as the man is, so is his strength. Gideon arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels` necks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule you over us, both you, and your son, and your son`s son also; for you have saved us out of the hand of Midian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: Yahweh shall rule over you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Gideon said to them, I would make a request of you, that you would give me every man the ear-rings of his spoil. (For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They answered, We will willingly give them. They spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested was one thousand and seven hundred [shekels] of gold, besides the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels` necks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Gideon made an ephod of it, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel played the prostitute after it there; and it became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. The land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body; for he had many wives.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">His mother`s brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">He said to his mother, The eleven hundred [pieces] of silver that were taken from you, about which you did utter a curse, and did also speak it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. His mother said, Blessed be my son of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He restored the eleven hundred [pieces] of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I most assuredly dedicate the silver to Yahweh from my hand for my son, to make an engraved image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred [pieces] of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made of it an engraved image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find [a place], and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Micah said to him, Whence come you? He said to him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find [a place].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten [pieces] of silver by the year, and a suit of clothing, and your victuals. So the Levite went in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then said Micah, Now know I that Yahweh will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day [their] inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land. They came to the hill-country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside there, and said to him, Who brought you here? and what do you in this place? and what have you here?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He said to them, Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I am become his priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The priest said to them, Go in peace: before Yahweh is your way wherein you go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people who were therein, how they lived in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put [them] to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brothers said to them, What [say] you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are you still? don`t be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When you go, you shall come to a people secure, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There set forth from there of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah: why they called that place Mahaneh-dan, to this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath-jearim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They passed there to the hill-country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered, and said to their brothers, Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and an engraved image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They turned aside there, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When these went into Micah`s house, and fetched the engraved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, What do you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The priest`s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went in the midst of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near to Micah`s house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They cried to the children of Dan. They turned their faces, and said to Micah, What ails you, that you come with such a company?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He said, you have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say you to me, What ails you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The children of Dan said to him, "Don`t let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth-rehob. They built the city, and lived therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: however the name of the city was Laish at the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So they set them up Micah`s engraved image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">His concubine played the prostitute against him, and went away from him to her father`s house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there the space of four months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of donkeys: and she brought him into her father`s house; and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">His father-in-law, the young lady`s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they ate and drink, and lodged there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It happened on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the young lady`s father said to his son-in-law, Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you shall go your way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So they sat down, and ate and drink, both of them together: and the young lady`s father said to the man, Please be pleased to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the young lady`s father said, Please strengthen your heart and stay until the day declines; and they ate, both of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the young lady`s father, said to him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, please stay all night: behold, the day grows to an end, lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow get you early on your way, that you may go home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the man wouldn`t stay that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem): and there were with him a couple of donkeys saddled; his concubine also was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Please come and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">His master said to him, We won`t turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He said to his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They turned aside there, to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even: now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Where go you? and whence come you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said to him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah to the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from there am I, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am [now] going to the house of Yahweh; and there is no man who takes me into his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid, and for the young man who is with your servants: there is no want of anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The old man said, Peace be to you; howsoever let all your wants lie on me; only don`t lodge in the street.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder; and they washed their feet, and ate and drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man who came into your house, that we may know him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my brothers, please don`t act so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, don`t do this folly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do with them what seems good to you: but to this man don`t do any such folly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But the men wouldn`t listen to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man`s house where her lord was, until it was light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He said to her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered: then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up, and got him to his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">It was so, that all who saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day: consider it, take counsel, and speak.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to Yahweh at Mizpah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) The children of Israel said, Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about me by night; me they thought to have slain, and my concubine they forced, and she is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: [we will go up] against it by lot;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get victuals for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is happen among you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left-handed; everyone could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew sword: all these were men of war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The children of Israel arose, and went up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin? Yahweh said, Judah [shall go up] first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day Twenty-two thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The children of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until even; and they asked of Yahweh, saying, Shall I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? Yahweh said, Go up against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before Yahweh, and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The children of Israel asked of Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? Yahweh said, Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Israel set liers-in-wait against Gibeah round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The children of Benjamin said, They are struck down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">All the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers-in-wait of Israel broke forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">There came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they didn`t know that evil was close on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men: all these drew the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted to the liers-in-wait whom they had set against Gibeah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The liers-in-wait hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the liers-in-wait drew themselves along, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers-in-wait was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and, behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil had come on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">They enclosed the Benjamites round about, [and] chased them, [and] trod them down at [their] resting-place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">There fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these [were] men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck of them two thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these [were] men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the cattle, and all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The people came to Bethel, and sat there until evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It happened on the next day that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace-offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who didn`t come up in the assembly to Yahweh? For they had made a great oath concerning him who didn`t come up to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">How shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn`t come up to Yahweh to Mizpah? Behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has lain by man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they weren`t enough for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The people repented them for Benjamin, because that Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They said, There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">However we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They said, Behold, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come you out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, Grant them graciously to us, because we didn`t take for each man his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, else would you now be guilty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and built the cities, and lived in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The children of Israel departed there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. A certain man of Bethlehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. They came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Elimelech, Naomi`s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they lived there about ten years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">She went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother`s house: Yahweh deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yahweh grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They said to her, No, but we will return with you to your people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will you go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">would you therefore wait until they were grown? would you therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters, for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of Yahweh is gone forth against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth joined with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">She said, Behold, your sister-in-law is gone back to her people, and to her god: return you after your sister-in-law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Ruth said, "Don`t entreat me to leave you, and to return from following after you, for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried: Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death part you and me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. It happened, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and [the women] said, Is this Naomi?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">She said to them, "Don`t call me Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty; why do you call me Naomi, seeing Yahweh has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Naomi had a kinsman of her husband`s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. She said to her, Go, my daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, Yahweh be with you. They answered him, Yahweh bless you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said Boaz to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose young lady is this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The servant who was set over the reapers answered, It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">She said, Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then said Boaz to Ruth, Don`t you hear, my daughter? Don`t go to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them: haven`t I charged the young men that they shall not touch you? and when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Boaz answered her, It has fully been showed me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn`t know before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Yahweh recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to take refuge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">At meal-time Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. She sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was sufficed, and left of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don`t reproach her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and don`t rebuke her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? and where have you worked? blessed be he who did take knowledge of you. She showed her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, The man`s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. Naomi said to her, The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, You shall keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now isn`t Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your clothing on you, and get you down to the threshing floor, but don`t make yourself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">She said to her, All that you say I will do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">She went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It happened at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said, Who are you? She answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said, Blessed be you of Yahweh, my daughter: you have showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you didn`t follow young men, whether poor or rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now, my daughter, don`t be afraid; I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however there is a kinsman nearer than I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman`s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh lives: lie down until the morning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">She lay at his feet until the morning. She rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said, Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid it on her: and he went into the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are you, my daughter? She told her all that the man had done to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">She said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said, "Don`t go empty to your mother-in-law."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then said she, "Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he has finished the thing this day."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. He turned aside, and sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you down here. They sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech`s:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you. He said, I will redeem it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The near kinsman said, I can`t redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance: take my right of redemption on you; for I can`t redeem it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself. He drew off his shoe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech`s, and all that was Chilion`s and Mahlon`s, of the hand of Naomi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall give you of this young woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they named him Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now this is the history of the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="9" bname="1 Samuel" bsname="1Sam">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Hosts in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">[as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Yahweh, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why don`t you eat? and why is your heart grieved? am I not better to you than ten sons?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the door-post of the temple of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, and wept sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">She vowed a vow, and said, Yahweh of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man-child, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It happened, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli marked her mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Eli said to her, How long will you be drunken? put away your wine from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Hannah answered, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Don`t count your handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Eli answered, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She said, Let your handmaid find favor in your sight. So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn`t sad any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Yahweh, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">It happened, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, [saying], Because I have asked him of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Hannah didn`t go up; for she said to her husband, [I will not go up] until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and there abide forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems you good; wait until you have weaned him; only Yahweh establish his word. So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of Yahweh in Shiloh: and the child was young.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">She said, Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For this child I prayed; and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">therefore also I have granted him to Yahweh; as long as he lives he is granted to Yahweh. He worshipped Yahweh there.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exults in Yahweh; My horn is exalted in Yahweh; My mouth is enlarged over my enemies; Because I rejoice in your salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There is none holy as Yahweh; For there is none besides you, Neither is there any rock like our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Talk no more so exceeding proudly; Don`t let arrogance come out of your mouth; For Yahweh is a God of knowledge, By him actions are weighed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The bows of the mighty men are broken; Those who stumbled are girded with strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Those who were full have hired out themselves for bread; Those who were hungry have ceased [to hunger]: Yes, the barren has borne seven; She who has many children languishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yahweh kills, and makes alive: He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich: He brings low, he also lifts up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He raises up the poor out of the dust, He lifts up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, Inherit the throne of glory: For the pillars of the earth are Yahweh`s, He has set the world on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He will keep the feet of his holy ones; But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; For by strength shall no man prevail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces; Against them will he thunder in the sky: Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth; He will give strength to his king, Exalt the horn of his anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child did minister to Yahweh before Eli the priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now the sons of Eli were base men; they didn`t know Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest`s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest`s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of you, but raw.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would say, No, but you shall give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised the offering of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Yahweh give you seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh. They went to their own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of meeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make Yahweh`s people to disobey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Yahweh, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they didn`t listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh was minded to kill them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">There came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Did I reveal myself to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt [in bondage] to Pharaoh`s house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in [my] habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever: but now Yahweh says, Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father`s house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">You shall see the affliction of [my] habitation, in all the wealth which [God] shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The man of yours, [whom] I shall not cut off from my altar, [shall be] to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Please put me into one of the priests` offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli. The word of Yahweh was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and the lamp of God hadn`t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down [to sleep], in the temple of Yahweh, where the ark of God was;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">that Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. He said, I didn`t call; lie down again. He went and lay down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yahweh called yet again, Samuel. Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. He answered, I didn`t call, my son; lie down again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Samuel didn`t yet know Yahweh, neither was the word of Yahweh yet revealed to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yahweh called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call you, that you shall say, Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for your servant hears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yahweh said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse on themselves, and he didn`t restrain them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli`s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh. Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. He said, Here am I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He said, "What is the thing that [Yahweh] has spoken to you? Please don`t hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. He said, It is Yahweh: let him do what seems him good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Yahweh.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was struck before the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has Yahweh struck us today before the Philistines? Let us get the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Hosts, who sits [above] the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What means the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? They understood that the ark of Yahweh was come into the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. They said, Woe to us! for there has not been such a thing heretofore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Be strong, and behave yourselves like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Philistines fought, and Israel was struck, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with earth on his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. When the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What means the noise of this tumult? The man hurried, and came and told Eli.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The man said to Eli, I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. He said, How went the matter, my son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He who brought the news answered, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">It happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that [Eli] fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">His daughter-in-law, Phinehas` wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the news that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came on her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">About the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, Don`t be afraid; for you have brought forth a son. But she didn`t answer, neither did she regard it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer to Ashdod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh. They took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When they arose early on the next day morning, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands [lay] cut off on the threshold; only [the stump of] Dagon was left to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon`s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the hand of Yahweh was heavy on them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for his hand is sore on us, and on Dagon our god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? They answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. They carried the ark of the God of Israel [there].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It was so, that after they had carried it about, the hand of Yahweh was against the city with a very great confusion: and he struck the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors broke out on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. It happened, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people. For there was a deadly confusion throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The men who didn`t die were struck with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Then they said, "What shall be the trespass-offering which we shall return to him?"     They said, "Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, [according to] the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had worked wonderfully among them, didn`t they let the people go, and they departed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart, and two milk cattle, on which there has come no yoke; and tie the cattle to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">The men did so, and took two milk cattle, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">It happened, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you do return to Yahweh with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts to Yahweh, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the children of Israel did put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served Yahweh only.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">They gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Yahweh, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against Yahweh. Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The children of Israel said to Samuel, "Don`t cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He had a son, whose name was Saul, a young man and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The donkeys of Kish, Saul`s father, were lost. Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they didn`t find them: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they weren`t there: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they didn`t find them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father leave off caring for the donkeys, and be anxious for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He said to him, See now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in honor; all that he says comes surely to pass: now let us go there; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">(In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he who is now called a Prophet was before called a Seer.)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you: make haste now, for he is come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">as soon as you are come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he does bless the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat who are invited.

      <VERS vnumber="14">They went up to the city; [and] as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, don`t set your mind on them; for they are found. For whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you, and for all your father`s house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Saul answered, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you to me after this manner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it by you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. [Samuel] said, Behold, that which has been reserved! set it before you and eat; because to the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they were come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They arose early: and it happened about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send you away. Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand you still first, that I may cause you to hear the word of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet you there three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs happened that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">It happened, when all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">One of the same place answered, Who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Saul`s uncle said to him and to his servant, Where went you? He said, To seek the donkeys; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Saul`s uncle said, Tell me, Please, what Samuel said to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spoke, he didn`t tell him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and he said to the children of Israel, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, Is there yet a man to come here? Yahweh answered, Behold, he has hid himself among the baggage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Samuel said to all the people, "You see him whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?"     All the people shouted, and said, [Long] live the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh. Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the host, whose hearts God had touched.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">The Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever doesn`t come forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.

      <VERS vnumber="1">Saul was [forty] years old when he began to reign; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel, whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the Mount of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">All Israel heard say that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. The people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth-aven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He stayed seven days, according to the set time that Samuel [had appointed]: but Samuel didn`t come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Saul said, Bring here the burnt offering to me, and the peace-offerings. He offered the burnt offering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">It came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Samuel said, What have you done? Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn`t come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven`t entreated the favor of Yahweh: I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt offering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you: for now would Yahweh have established your kingdom on Israel forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But now your kingdom shall not continue: Yahweh has sought him a man after his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the plowshares, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines` garrison, that is on yonder side. But he didn`t tell his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which is in Migron: and the people who were with him were about six hundred men;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod`s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The people didn`t know that Jonathan was gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines` garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no restraint to Yahweh to save by many or by few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">His armor bearer said to him, Do all that is in your heart: turn you, behold, I am with you according to your heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will disclose ourselves to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If they say thus to us, Wait until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up; for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand: and this shall be the sign to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Both of them disclosed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. Jonathan said to his armor bearer, Come up after me; for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow`s length in an acre of land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went [here] and there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then said Saul to the people who were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. When they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Saul said to Ahijah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was [there] at that time with the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It happened, while Saul talked to the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and, behold, every man`s sword was against his fellow, [and there was] a very great confusion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before, and who went up with them into the camp, [from the country] round about, even they also [turned] to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So Yahweh saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth-aven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man who eats any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the people were come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Jonathan didn`t hear when his father charged the people with the oath: why he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then answered one of the people, and said, Your father directly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man who eats food this day. The people were faint.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">and the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Yahweh, in that they eat with the blood. He said, you have dealt treacherously: roll a great stone to me this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and don`t sin against Yahweh in eating with the blood. All the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and killed them there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Saul built an altar to Yahweh: the same was the first altar that he built to Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. They said, Do whatever seems good to you. Then said the priest, Let us draw near here to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? will you deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he didn`t answer him that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Saul said, Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people; and know and see in which this sin has been this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For, as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then said he to all Israel, Be you on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. The people said to Saul, Do what seems good to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, Show the right. Jonathan and Saul were taken [by lot]; but the people escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son. Jonathan was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and, behold, I must die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Saul said, God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he didn`t die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he put [them] to the worse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and the name of Saul`s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his host was Abner the son of Ner, Saul`s uncle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">There was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Samuel said to Saul, Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore listen you to the voice of the words of Yahweh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don`t spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, Blessed be you of Yahweh: I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Samuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me this night. He said to him, Say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Samuel said, "Though you were little in your own sight, weren`t you made the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, `Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Why then didn`t you obey the voice of Yahweh, but flew on the spoil, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Samuel said, Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, he has also rejected you from being king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As Samuel turned about to go away, [Saul] laid hold on the skirt of his robe, and it tore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Samuel said to him, Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, Please, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then said Samuel, Bring you here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Yahweh repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Yahweh said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill your horn with oil, and go: I will send you to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. Yahweh said, Take a heifer with you, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do: and you shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Come you peaceably?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice to Yahweh: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It happened, when they had come, that he looked at Eliab, and said, Surely Yahweh`s anointed is before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Yahweh said to Samuel, "Don`t look on his face, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for [Yahweh sees] not as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, Neither has Yahweh chosen this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, Neither has Yahweh chosen this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, Yahweh has not chosen these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children? He said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. Samuel said to Jesse, Send and get him; for we will not sit down until he come here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to look on. Yahweh said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers: and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Saul`s servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let our lord now command your servants who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp: and it shall happen, when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, who is skillful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Yahweh is with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesse took a donkey [laden] with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Please let David stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It happened, when the [evil] spirit from God was on Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He had a helmet of brass on his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He had brass shin-armor on his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The staff of his spear was like a weaver`s beam; and his spear`s head [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron: and his shield-bearer went before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why are you come out to set your battle in array? am I not a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall you be our servants, and serve us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken [in years] among men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father`s sheep at Beth-lehem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry [them] quickly to the camp to your brothers;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The men of Israel said, Have you seen this man who is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father`s house free in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man who kills him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab`s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why are you come down? and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He turned away from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">David said to Saul, Let no man`s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">David said to Saul, Your servant was keeping his father`s sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I went out after him, and struck him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and struck him, and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Your servant struck both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">David said, Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. Saul said to David, Go, and Yahweh shall be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Saul clad David with his clothing, and he put a helmet of brass on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">David girded his sword on his clothing, and he tried to go; for he had not proved it. David said to Saul, I can`t go with these; for I have not proved them. David put them off him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd`s bag which he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">When the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks? The Philistine cursed David by his gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to you in the name of Yahweh of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">This day will Yahweh deliver you into my hand; and I will strike you, and take your head from off you; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn`t save with sword and spear: for the battle is Yahweh`s, and he will give you into our hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">It happened, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, that David hurried, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone, and slang it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath of it, and killed him, and cut off his head therewith. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">The men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">He said to him, Far from it; you shall not die: behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">David swore moreover, and said, Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes; and he says, Don`t let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said Jonathan to David, Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David said to Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at even.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If your father miss me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If he say thus, It is well; your servant shall have peace: but if he be angry, then know that evil is determined by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you: but if there be in me iniquity, kill me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jonathan said, Far be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come on you, then wouldn`t I tell you that?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance your father answer you roughly?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. They went out both of them into the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jonathan said to David, Yahweh, the God of Israel, [be witness]: when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, [or] the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send to you, and disclose it to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yahweh do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I don`t disclose it to you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and Yahweh be with you, as he has been with my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You shall not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Yahweh, that I not die;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever; no, not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, [saying], Yahweh will require it at the hand of David`s enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon: and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Behold, I will send the boy, [saying], Go, find the arrows. If I tell the boy, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you; take them, and come; for there is peace to you and no hurt, as Yahweh lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But if I say thus to the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond you; go your way; for Yahweh has sent you away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As touching the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, Yahweh is between you and me forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul`s side: but David`s place was empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Nevertheless Saul didn`t say anything that day: for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">It happened on the next day after the new moon, [which was] the second [day], that David`s place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why doesn`t the son of Jesse come to meat, neither yesterday, nor today?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and he said, Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me [to be there]: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my brothers. Therefore he is not come to the king`s table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then Saul`s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don`t I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother`s nakedness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Why now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why should he be put to death? what has he done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Saul cast his spear at him to strike him; whereby Jonathan knew that is was determined of his father to put David to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">It happened in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He said to his boy, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">When the boy was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, Isn`t the arrow beyond you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Jonathan cried after the boy, Go fast! Hurry! Don`t delay! Jonathan`s boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But the boy didn`t know anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of [a place] toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, because we have sworn both of us in the name of Yahweh, saying, Yahweh shall be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, forever. He arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, Let no man know anything of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you: and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now therefore what is under your hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then today shall their vessels be holy?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the priest gave him holy [bread]; for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David said to Ahimelech, Isn`t there here under your hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king`s business required haste.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it; for there is no other except that here. David said, There is none like that; give it me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The servants of Achish said to him, "Isn`t this David the king of the land? Didn`t they sing one to another about him in dances, saying, `Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then said Achish to his servants, Look, you see the man is mad; why then have you brought him to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father`s house heard it, they went down there to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves to him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">David went there to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Please let my father and my mother come forth, [and be] with you, until I know what God will do for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He brought them before the king of Moab: and they lived with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The prophet Gad said to David, Don`t stay in the stronghold; depart, and get you into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him: now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk-tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Saul said to his servants who stood about him, Hear now, you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none who discloses to me when my son makes a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me, or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He inquired of Yahweh for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father`s house, the priests who were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub. He answered, Here I am, my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Saul said to him, Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, Who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king`s son-in-law, and is taken into your council, and is honorable in your house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: don`t let the king impute anything to his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing of all this, less or more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The king said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The king said to the guard who stood about him, Turn, and kill the priests of Yahweh; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and didn`t disclose it to me. But the servants of the king wouldn`t put forth their hand to fall on the priests of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall on the priests. Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell on the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore a linen ephod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Nob, the city of the priests, struck he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing babies, and oxen and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Yahweh`s priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">David said to Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned [the death] of all the persons of your father`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Abide you with me, don`t be afraid; for he who seeks my life seeks your life: for with me you shall be in safeguard.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">They told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go and strike these Philistines? Yahweh said to David, Go, and strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">David`s men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then David inquired of Yahweh yet again. Yahweh answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David save the inhabitants of Keilah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. Saul said, God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said David, O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? Yahweh, the God of Israel, I beg you, tell your servant. Yahweh said, He will come down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up to me and my men into the hand of Saul? Yahweh said, They will deliver you up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. It was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he gave up going there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God didn`t deliver him into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jonathan, Saul`s son, arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He said to him, Don`t be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They two made a covenant before Yahweh: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn`t David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king`s hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Saul said, Blessed be you of Yahweh; for you have had compassion on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Plesease go make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, [and] who has seen him there; for it is told me that he deals very subtly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hides himself, and come you again to me of a certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall happen, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Saul and his men went to seek him. They told David: why he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard [that], he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste you, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">David went up from there, and lived in the strongholds of En-gedi.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He came to the sheep pens by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The men of David said to him, Behold, the day of which Yahweh said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul`s robe secretly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It happened afterward, that David`s heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul`s skirt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He said to his men, Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Yahweh`s anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Yahweh`s anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So David checked his men with these words, and didn`t allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">David said to Saul, Why listen you to men`s words, saying, Behold, David seeks your hurt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill you; but [my eye] spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh`s anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn`t kill you, know you and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt after my life to take it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Yahweh judge between me and you, and Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand shall not be on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As says the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He said to David, You are more righteous than I; for you have rendered to me good, whereas I have rendered to you evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">You have declared this day how that you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn`t kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? why Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">David swore to Saul. Saul went home; but David and his men got them up to the stronghold.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful face: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and thus shall you tell him who lives [in prosperity], Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now I have heard that you have shearers: your shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there anything missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Ask your young men, and they will tell you: why let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good day. Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When David`s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Nabal answered David`s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a-days who break away every man from his master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I don`t know where they come from?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So David`s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">David said to his men, Gird you on every man his sword. They girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal`s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to Greet our master; and he railed at them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">they were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house: for he is such a worthless fellow that one can`t speak to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">She said to her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she didn`t tell her husband, Nabal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">It was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him: and he has returned me evil for good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one man-child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When Abigail saw David, she hurried, and alighted from her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">She fell at his feet, and said, On me, my lord, on me be the iniquity; and please let your handmaid speak in your ears. Hear the words of your handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Please don`t let my lord regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I your handmaid didn`t see the young men of my lord, whom you did send.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now therefore, my lord, as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, seeing Yahweh has withheld you from blood guiltiness, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Please forgive the trespass of your handmaid: for Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fights the battles of Yahweh; and evil shall not be found in you all your days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Though men be risen up to pursue you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God; and the souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">It shall come to pass, when Yahweh shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and shall have appointed you prince over Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. When Yahweh shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">David said to Abigail, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">and blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, that have kept me this day from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For in very deed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, who has withheld me from hurting you, except you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there wouldn`t have been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one man-child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said to her, Go up in peace to your house; behold, I have listened to your voice, and have accepted your person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal`s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: why she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">It happened in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">It happened about ten days after, that Yahweh struck Nabal, so that he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Yahweh, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil: and the evil-doing of Nabal has Yahweh returned on his own head. David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him as wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">When the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies of hers who followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David`s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn`t David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped round about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? Abishai said, I will go down with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered up your enemy into your hand this day: now therefore please let me strike him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">David said to Abishai, Don`t destroy him; for who can put forth his hand against Yahweh`s anointed, and be guiltless?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">David said, As Yahweh lives, Yahweh will strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yahweh forbid that I should put forth my hand against Yahweh`s anointed: but now please take the spear that is at his head, and the jar of water, and let us go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul`s head; and they got them away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Yahweh was fallen on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Don`t you answer, Abner? Then Abner answered, Who are you who cries to the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">David said to Abner, Aren`t you a [valiant] man? and who is like you in Israel? why then have you not kept watch over your lord, the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king your lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This thing isn`t good that you have done. As Yahweh lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, Yahweh`s anointed. Now see where the king`s spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Saul knew David`s voice, and said, Is this your voice, my son David? David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, Why does my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be Yahweh that has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before Yahweh: for they have driven me out this day that I shouldn`t cling to Yahweh`s inheritance, saying, Go, serve other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now therefore, don`t let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge in the mountains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David; for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">David answered, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of the young men come over and get it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Yahweh will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today, and I wouldn`t put forth my hand against Yahweh`s anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Behold, as your life was much set by this day in my eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Yahweh, and let him deliver me out of all oppression.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Saul said to David, Blessed be you, my son David: you shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal`s wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David said to Achish, If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: why Ziklag pertains to the kings of Judah to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David and his men went up, and made a raid on the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those [nations] were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">David struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the clothing; and he returned, and came to Achish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Achish said, Against whom have you made a raid today? David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David, and so has been his manner all the while he has lived in the country of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant forever.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened in those days, that the Philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare, to fight with Israel. Achish said to David, Know you assuredly, that you shall go out with me in the host, you and your men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">David said to Achish, Therefore you shall know what your servant will do. Achish said to David, Therefore will I make you keeper of my head for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Saul inquired of Yahweh, Yahweh didn`t answer him, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman who has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. His servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has a familiar spirit at En-dor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Saul disguised himself, and put on other clothing, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Please divine to me by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whoever I shall name to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: why then lay you a snare for my life, to cause me to die?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Saul swore to her by Yahweh, saying, As Yahweh lives, there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to you? He said, Bring me up Samuel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? for you are Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The king said to her, Don`t be afraid: for what do you see? The woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said to her, What form is he of? She said, An old man comes up; and he is covered with a robe. Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up? Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Samuel said, Why then do you ask of me, seeing Yahweh is departed from you, and is become your adversary?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Yahweh has done to you, as he spoke by me: and Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Because you didn`t obey the voice of Yahweh, and didn`t execute his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore has Yahweh done this thing to you this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow shall you and your sons be with me: Yahweh will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat on the bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The woman had a fattened calf in the house; and she hurried, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread of it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="29">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said the princes of the Philistines, What [do] these Hebrews [here]? Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, Isn`t this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or [rather] these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away [to me] to this day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us: for with what should this [fellow] reconcile himself to his lord? should it not be with the heads of these men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Achish called David, and said to him, As Yahweh lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day: nevertheless the lords don`t favor you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you not displease the lords of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what have you found in your servant so long as I have been before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Achish answered David, I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you; and as soon as you are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. The Philistines went up to Jezreel.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="30">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South, and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and had taken captive the women [and all] who were therein, both small and great: they didn`t kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David`s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, Please bring me here the ephod. Abiathar brought there the ephod to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David inquired of Yahweh, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them? He answered him, Pursue; for you shall surely overtake [them], and shall without fail recover [all].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn`t go over the brook Besor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">David said to him, To whom belong you? and whence are you? He said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">David said to him, Will you bring me down to this troop? He said, Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day: and there not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drove before those [other] cattle, and said, This is David`s spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him: and when David came near to the people, he greeted them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who went with David, and said, Because they didn`t go with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then said David, You shall not do so, my brothers, with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Who will listen to you in this matter? for as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage: they shall share alike.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">To those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the South, and to those who were in Jattir,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the news to the house of their idols, and to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">David said to him, From whence come you? He said to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David said to him, How went the matter? Please tell me. He answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David said to the young man who told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The young man who told him said, As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and, behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, Here am I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said to me, Who are you? I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said to me, Stand, I pray you, beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">David said to the young man who told him, Whence are you? He answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">David said to him, How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh`s anointed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him. He struck him, so that he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain Yahweh`s anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">(and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of] the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places! How are the mighty fallen!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Don`t tell it in Gath, Don`t publish it in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan didn`t turn back, The sword of Saul didn`t return empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, In their death they were not divided: They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: Very pleasant have you been to me: Your love to me was wonderful, Passing the love of women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">How are the mighty fallen, The weapons of war perished!</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened after this, that David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? Yahweh said to him, Go up. David said, Where shall I go up? He said, To Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His men who were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they lived in the cities of Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were those who buried Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, Blessed be you of Yahweh, that you have showed this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now Yahweh show lovingkindness and truth to you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because you have done this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be you valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul`s host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Ish-bosheth, Saul`s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Abner said to Joab, Please let the young men arise and play before us. Joab said, Let them arise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They caught everyone his fellow by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow`s side; so they fell down together: why that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The battle was very severe that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he didn`t turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it you, Asahel? He answered, It is I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Abner said to him, Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay you hold on one of the young men, and take you his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me: why should I strike you to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">However he refused to turn aside: why Abner with the hinder end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it happened, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Abner called to Joab, and said, "Shall the sword devour forever? Don`t you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before you bid the people return from following their brothers?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Joab said, As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed everyone his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David`s servants nineteen men and Asahel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But the servants of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner`s men, [so that] three hundred sixty men died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David grew stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David`s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It happened, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and [Ish-bosheth] said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father`s concubine?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog`s head that belongs to Judah? This day do I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me this day with a fault concerning this woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn to David, I don`t do even so to him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying [also], Make your league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He said, Well; I will make a league with you; but one thing I require of you: that is, you shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal, Saul`s daughter, when you come to see my face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul`s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return: and he returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past you sought for David to be king over you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">now then do it; for Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires. David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When Joab and all the host who was with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David didn`t know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father`s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him, Tear your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. King David followed the bier.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters: As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so did you fall.     All the people wept again over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">All the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun be down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The king said to his servants, "Don`t you know that there a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. May Yahweh reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When [Ish-bosheth], Saul`s son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">[Ish-bosheth], Saul`s son, [had] two men who were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now Jonathan, Saul`s son, had a son who was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They came there into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they struck him, and killed him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; and Yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good news, I took hold of him, and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel: and Yahweh said to you, You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh: and they anointed David king over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here; thinking, David can`t come in here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David said on that day, Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and [strike] the lame and the blind, who are hated of David`s soul. Why they say, There are the blind and the lame; he can`t come into the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. David built round about from Millo and inward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of hosts, was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel`s sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? will you deliver them into my hand? Yahweh said to David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">David came to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They left their images there; and David and his men took them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When David inquired of Yahweh, he said, You shall not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come on them over against the mulberry-trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then you shall bestir yourself; for then is Yahweh gone out before you to strike the host of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">David arose, and went with all the people who were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Yahweh of Hosts who sits [above] the cherubim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">David and all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all manner of [instruments made of] fir-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with tambourines, and with castanets, and with cymbals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth [his hand] to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-uzzah, to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">David was afraid of Yahweh that day; and he said, How shall the ark of Yahweh come to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So David would not remove the ark of Yahweh to him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and Yahweh blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It was told king David, saying, Yahweh has blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God. David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">It was so, that, when those who bore the ark of Yahweh had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">David danced before Yahweh with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It was so, as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh; and she despised him in her heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They brought in the ark of Yahweh, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace-offerings before Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Hosts.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, Have out all men from me. They went out every man from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand. Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don`t you do this folly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I, where shall I carry my shame? and as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">She said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is [worse] than the other that you did to me. But he would not listen to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such robes were the king`s daughters who were virgins dressed. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but now hold your peace, my sister: he is your brother; don`t take this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It happened after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king`s sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Absalom came to the king, and said, See now, your servant has sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray you, and his servants go with your servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you. He pressed him: however he would not go, but blessed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then said Absalom, If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us. The king said to him, Why should he go with you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king`s sons go with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now, when Amnon`s heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; don`t be afraid; haven`t I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king`s sons arose, and every man got him up on his mule, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">It happened, while they were in the way, that the news came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king`s sons, and there is not one of them left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David`s brother, answered, Don`t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king`s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now therefore don`t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king`s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king`s sons are come: as your servant said, so it is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">It happened, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold, the king`s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. [David] mourned for his son every day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">[the soul of] king David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king`s heart was toward Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched there a wise woman, and said to her, please act like a mourner, and put on mourning clothing, Please, and don`t anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman who has a long time mourned for the dead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and go in to the king, and speak on this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king said to her, What ails you? She answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Your handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Behold, the whole family is risen against your handmaid, and they say, Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give charge concerning you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father`s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The king said, Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said she, Please let the king remember Yahweh your God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son. He said, As Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of your son fall to the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the woman said, Please let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king. He said, Say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The woman said, Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home again his banished one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground, which can`t be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be an outcast from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then your handmaid said, Please let the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Yahweh your God be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king answered the woman, Please don`t hide anything from me that I shall ask you. The woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this? The woman answered, As your soul lives, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and didn`t see the king`s face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year`s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king`s weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a beautiful face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem; and he didn`t see the king`s face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore he said to his servants, Behold, Joab`s field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. Absalom`s servants set the field on fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, Why am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king`s face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are you? He said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Absalom said to him, Behold, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputized of the king to hear you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In this manner Absalom did to all Israel who came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It happened at the end of forty years, that Absalom said to the king, please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For your servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Yahweh shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The king said to him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">With Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they didn`t know anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David`s counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The king`s servants said to the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall choose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The king went forth, and all his household after him. The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The king went forth, and all the people after him; and they stayed in Beth-merhak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why go you also with us? return, and abide with the king: for you are a foreigner, and also an exile; [return] to your own place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us, seeing I go where I may? return you, and take back your brothers; mercy and truth be with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Ittai answered the king, and said, As Yahweh lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will your servant be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Behold, Zadok also [came], and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of Yahweh, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">but if he say thus, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seems good to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The king said also to Zadok the priest, "Aren`t you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they abode there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">David went up by the ascent of the [Mount of] Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people who were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">One told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. David said, Yahweh, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">It happened that when David had come to the top [of the ascent], where God was worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn, and earth on his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">David said to him, If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father`s servant in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Don`t you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you? therefore it shall be, that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king`s house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok`s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar`s son; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So Hushai, David`s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When David was a little past the top [of the ascent], behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The king said to Ziba, What do you mean by these? Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king`s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The king said, Where is your master`s son? Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem; for he said, Today will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours. Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of the house of Saul came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out, and cursed still as he came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Thus said Shimei when he cursed, Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and base fellow:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son; and, behold, you are [taken] in your own mischief, because you are a man of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said to him, Curse David; who then shall say, Why have you done so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life: how much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it]? let him alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will requite me good for [his] cursing of me this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It happened, when Hushai the Archite, David`s friend, was come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, [Long] live the king, [Long] live the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn`t you go with your friend?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn`t I serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in your father`s presence, so will I be in your presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father`s concubines, that he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred of your father: then will the hands of all who are with you be strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father`s concubines in the sight of all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and I will come on him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people who are with him shall flee; and I will strike the king only;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and I will bring back all the people to you: the man whom you seek is as if all returned: [so] all the people shall be in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we do [after] his saying? if not, speak up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Hushai said moreover, You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some [other] place: and it will happen, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there not be one small stone found there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Don`t lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But a boy saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The woman took and spread the covering over the well`s mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Absalom`s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? The woman said to them, They have gone over the brook of water. When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>

The king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But the people said, You shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but you are worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that you be ready to help us out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The king said to them, What seems you best I will do. The king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. All the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Yahweh your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king`s servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don`t know what it was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The king said, Turn aside, and stand here. He turned aside, and stood still.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, my son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, who this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. They told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate: and all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance, but didn`t go in to them.

      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be you here present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Amasa went to call [the men of] Judah together; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take your lord`s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There went out after him Joab`s men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab`s hand: so he struck him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and didn`t strike him again; and he died. Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There stood by him one of Joab`s young men, and said, He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Joab answered, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The matter is not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.

      <VERS vnumber="1">Again the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The king said to Joab the captain of the host, who was with him, Go now back and forth through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number you the people, that I may know the sum of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Joab said to the king, Now Yahweh your God add to the people, however many they may be, one hundred times; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Notwithstanding, the king`s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Sidon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So when they had gone back and forth through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">David`s heart struck him after that he had numbered the people. David said to Yahweh, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done: but now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When David rose up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came to the prophet Gad, David`s seer, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Go and speak to David, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? or shall there be three days` pestilence in your land? now advise you, and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahweh repented him of the evil, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, It is enough; now stay your hand. The angel of Yahweh was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people, and said, Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me, and against my father`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant? David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar to Yahweh, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him: behold, the oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">all this, king, does Araunah give to the king. Araunah said to the king, Yahweh your God accept you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The king said to Araunah, No; but I will most assuredly buy it of you at a price. Neither will I offer burnt-offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings and peace-offerings. So Yahweh was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king didn`t know her intimately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">His father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have you done so? and he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my place; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Didn`t I adjure you by Yahweh, and protest to you, saying, Know for certain, that on the day you go out, and walk abroad any where, you shall surely die? and you said to me, The saying that I have heard is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Why then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh, and the commandment that I have charged you with?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father: therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Yahweh forever.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length of it was one hundred cubits, and the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">It was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams, that were on the pillars; fifteen in a row.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">All the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He made the porch of pillars; the length of it was fifty cubits, and the breadth of it thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">His house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh`s daughter (whom Solomon had taken as wife), like this porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar-wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The great court round about had three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of Yahweh, and the porch of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. He came to king Solomon, and performed all his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits compassed either of them about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">There were nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars: and so did he for the other capital.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">There were capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about on the other capital.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name of it Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name of it Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">On the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height of it was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Under the brim of it round about there were buds which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about: the buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">It was a handbreadth thick: and the brim of it was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and three cubits the height of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The work of the bases was on this manner: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet of it had supports: beneath the basin were the supports molten, with wreaths at the side of each.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and the mouth of it was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on the mouth of it were engravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">There were four supports at the four corners of each base: the supports of it were of the base itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">In the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays of it and the panels of it were of the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">On the plates of the stays of it, and on the panels of it, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He made ten basins of brass: one basin contained forty baths; and every basin was four cubits; and on very one of the ten bases one basin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Yahweh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">and the ten bases, and the ten basins on the bases;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of Yahweh, were of burnished brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed], because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the show bread was, of gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">and the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple, of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of Yahweh was finished. Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, [even] the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers` [houses] of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, which is Zion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">All the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They brought up the ark of Yahweh, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the poles of it above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there they are to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">It came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Yahweh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then spoke Solomon, Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you to dwell in forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David your father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But Yahweh said to David my father, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house for my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yahweh has established his word that he spoke; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">There have I set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and he said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keep covenant and lovingkindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">who have kept with your servant David my father that which you did promise him: yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now therefore, God of Israel, Please let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can`t contain you; how much less this house that I have built!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="62">The king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered to Yahweh, two and twenty thousand oxen, and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">The same day did the king make the middle of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered the burnt offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Yahweh had showed to David his servant, and to Israel his people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their clothing, and his cup bearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">She said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">However I didn`t believe the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me; your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, [and] who hear your wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel: because Yahweh loved Israel forever, therefore made he you king, to do justice and righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">She gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees and precious stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The king made of the almug-trees pillars for the house of Yahweh, and for the king`s house, harps also and psalteries for the singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor were seen, to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">besides [that which] the traders [brought], and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mingled people, and of the governors of the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one buckler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">[he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">All king Solomon`s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">All the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king`s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">of the nations concerning which Yahweh said to the children of Israel, You shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon joined to these in love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it happened, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God, as was the heart of David his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and didn`t go fully after Yahweh, as did David his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yahweh was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Yahweh, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he didn`t keep that which Yahweh commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore Yahweh said to Solomon, Because this is done of you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it, for David your father`s sake: but I will tear it out of the hand of your son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">However I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for David my servant`s sake, and for Jerusalem`s sake which I have chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king`s seed in Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had struck every male in Edom</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">They arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh`s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh`s house among the sons of Pharaoh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you seek to go to your own country? He answered, Nothing: however only let me depart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">God raised up [another] adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop, when David killed them [of Zobah]: and they went to Damascus, and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad [did]: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother`s name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">It happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now [Ahijah] had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces; for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David`s sake and for Jerusalem`s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant`s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren`t they written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. The people departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give you me to return answer to this people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They spoke to him, saying, If you will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said to them, What counsel do you give, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that your father did put on us lighter?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you tell this people who spoke to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us; thus shall you speak to them, My little finger is thicker than my father`s loins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the king didn`t listen to the people; for it was a thing brought about of Yahweh, that he might establish his word, which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When all Israel saw that the king didn`t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, Israel: now see to your own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">It happened, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none who followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Thus says Yahweh, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they listened to the word of Yahweh, and returned and went their way, according to the word of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and lived therein; and he went out from there, and built Penuel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return to the house of David:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: see your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This thing became a sin; for the people went [to worship] before the one, even to Dan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; so did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar, to burn incense.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Yahweh to Beth- el: and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh, and said, altar, altar, thus says Yahweh: Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and men`s bones shall they burn on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Yahweh has spoken: Behold, the altar shall be torn, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It happened, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. His hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The altar also was torn, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The king answered the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. The man of God entreated Yahweh, and the king`s hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The man of God said to the king, If you will give me half your house, I will not go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">for so was it charged me by the word of Yahweh, saying, You shall eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that you came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So he went another way, and didn`t return by the way that he came to Bethel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now there lived an old prophet in Bethel; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken to the king, them also they told to their father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Their father said to them, Which way did he go? Now his sons had seen which way the man of God went, who came from Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He said to his sons, Saddle me the donkey. So they saddled him the donkey; and he rode thereon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said to him, Are you the man of God who came from Judah? He said, I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He said, I may not return with you, nor go in with you; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for it was said to me by the word of Yahweh, You shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that you came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said to him, I also am a prophet as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the word of Yahweh, saying, Bring him back with you into your house, that he may eat bread and drink water. [But] he lied to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">It happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have been disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh, and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh your God commanded you,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">It happened, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the donkey, [to wit], for the prophet whom he had brought back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and killed him: and his body was cast in the way, and the donkey stood by it; the lion also stood by the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh: therefore Yahweh has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him, and slain him, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the donkey. They saddled it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He went and found his body cast in the way, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body: the lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the donkey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, [saying], Alas, my brother!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It happened, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the saying which he cried by the word of Yahweh against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">After this thing Jeroboam didn`t return from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">This thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">It was so, that as often as the king went into the house of Yahweh, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks: peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose all the animals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it you, my lord Elijah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He answered him, It is I: go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is here].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said, Wherein have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you: and when they said, He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they didn`t find you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you I don`t know where; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he can`t find you, he will kill me: but I your servant fear Yahweh from my youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Wasn`t it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, how I hid one hundred men of Yahweh`s prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Elijah said, As Yahweh of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Is it you, you troubler of Israel?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">With the stones he built an altar in the name of Yahweh; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He said, Do it the second time; and they did it the second time. He said, Do it the third time; and they did it the third time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">It happened at the time of the offering of the [evening] offering, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Hear me, Yahweh, hear me, that this people may know that you, Yahweh, are God, and [that] you have turned their heart back again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, Yahweh, he is God; Yahweh, he is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; don`t let one of them escape. They took them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">[Ben-hadad] said to him, The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. I, [said Ahab], will let you go with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of Yahweh, Please strike me. The man refused to strike him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Naboth said to Ahab, Yahweh forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. He laid him down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this sickness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now therefore thus says Yahweh, You shall not come down from the bed where you are gone up, but shall surely die. Elijah departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why is it that you have returned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They said to him, There came up a man to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king who sent you, and tell him, Thus says Yahweh, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you are gone up, but shall surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He said to them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a belt of leather about his loins. He said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then [the king] sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. He went up to him: and, behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. He spoke to him, man of God, the king has said, Come down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty. Fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty. He answered him, man of God, thus has the king said, Come down quickly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Elijah answered them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty. The fire of God came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, Go down with him: don`t be afraid of him. He arose, and went down with him to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you are gone up, but shall surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren`t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened, when Yahweh would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Elijah said to Elisha, Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel. Elisha said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Bethel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, "Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?"     He said, "Yes, I know it; hold your peace."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Elijah said to him, Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho. He said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, "Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?"     He answered, "Yes, I know it. Hold your peace."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Elijah said to him, "Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan."     He said, "As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you." They two went on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off: and they two stood by the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they two went over on dry ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It happened, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you. Elisha said, please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said, You have asked a hard thing: [nevertheless], if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so to you; but if not, it shall not be so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">It happened, as they still went on, and talked, that behold, [there appeared] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both apart; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen of it! He saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah? and when he also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha went over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They said to him, See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master, lest the Spirit of Yahweh has taken him up, and cast him on some mountain, or into some valley. He said, You shall not send.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but didn`t find him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, "Didn`t I tell you, `Don`t go?`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, we pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is bad, and the land miscarries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said, Bring me a new jar, and put salt therein. They brought it to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus says Yahweh, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or miscarrying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you baldy; go up, you baldhead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Yahweh. There came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and mauled forty-two lads of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Nevertheless he cleaved to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he didn`t depart therefrom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But it happened, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to battle? He said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He said, Which way shall we go up? He answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days` journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the animals that followed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The king of Israel said, Alas! for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Jehoshaphat said, Isn`t there here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of Yahweh by him? One of the king of Israel`s servants answered, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jehoshaphat said, The word of Yahweh is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? get you to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother. The king of Israel said to him, No; for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Elisha said, As Yahweh of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But now bring me a minstrel. It happened, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Yahweh came on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He said, Thus says Yahweh, Make this valley full of trenches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For thus says Yahweh, You shall not see wind, neither shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and you shall drink, both you and your cattle and your animals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This is but a light thing in the sight of Yahweh: he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">It happened in the morning, about the time of offering the offering, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each man his fellow: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the springs of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth [only] they left the stones of it; however the men armed with slings went about it, and struck it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear Yahweh: and the creditor is come to take to him my two children to be bondservants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? tell me; what have you in the house? She said, Your handmaid has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then he said, Go, borrow you vessels abroad of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You shall go in, and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and you shall set aside that which is full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons; they brought [the vessels] to her, and she poured out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It happened, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. He said to her, There isn`t another vessel. The oil stayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then she came and told the man of God. He said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your sons of the rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">She said to her husband, See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Let us make, Please, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a lamp stand: and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">It fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. When he had called her, she stood before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? would you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? She answered, I dwell among my own people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said, What then is to be done for her? Gehazi answered, Most assuredly she has no son, and her husband is old.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said, Call her. When he had called her, she stood in the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He said, At this season, when the time comes round, you shall embrace a son. She said, No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He said to his father, My head, my head. He said to his servant, Carry him to his mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] on him, and went out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">She called to her husband, and said, Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, Why will you go to him today? it is neither new moon nor Sabbath. She said, It shall be well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; don`t slacken me the riding, except I bid you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. It happened, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">please run now to meet her, and ask her, Is it well with you? is it well with your husband? is it well with the child? She answered, It is well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed within her; and Yahweh has hid it from me, and has not told me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? Didn`t I say, Do not deceive me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, Don`t greet him; and if anyone greets you, don`t answer him again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The mother of the child said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. He arose, and followed her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Why he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child has not awakened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">When Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid on his bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands: and he stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child grew warm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. When she was come in to him, he said, Take up your son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of stew; for they didn`t recognize them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So they poured out for the men to eat. It happened, as they were eating of the stew, that they cried out, and said, man of God, there is death in the pot. They could not eat of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But he said, Then bring meal. He cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. There was no harm in the pot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">There came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said, Give to the people, that they may eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">His servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus says Yahweh, They shall eat, and shall leave of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">So he set it before them, and they ate, and left of it, according to the word of Yahweh.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, [but he was] a leper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman`s wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">She said to her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">One went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden who is of the land of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of clothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may recover him of his leprosy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It happened, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man does send to me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have you torn your clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Aren`t Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid you do some great thing, wouldn`t you have done it? how much rather then, when he says to you, Wash, and be clean?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then went he down, and dipped [himself] seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, please take a present from your servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But he said, As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. He urged him to take it; but he refused.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Naaman said, If not, yet, please let there be given to your servant two mules` burden of earth; for your servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In this thing Yahweh pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Yahweh pardon your servant in this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Yahweh lives, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; please give them a talent of silver, and two changes of clothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they bore them before him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God: and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Yet Yahweh testified to Israel, and to Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, Turn you from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Yahweh rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">The children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they didn`t depart from them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight, as he spoke by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">So it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn`t fear Yahweh: therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which you have carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, don`t know the law of the god of the land: therefore he has sent lions among them, and, behold, they kill them, because they don`t know the law of the god of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">So they feared Yahweh, and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They feared Yahweh, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">To this day they do after the former manner: they don`t fear Yahweh, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which Yahweh commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Set your house in order: for you shall die, and not live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Yahweh, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. Hezekiah wept sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It happened, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of Yahweh came to him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Turn back, and tell Hezekiah the prince of my people, Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will heal you; on the third day you shall go up to the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I will add to your days fifteen years; and I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David`s sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. They took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Yahweh will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of Yahweh the third day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Isaiah said, This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten steps: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Isaiah the prophet cried to Yahweh; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn`t show them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to you? Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said, What have they seen in your house? Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Of your sons who shall issue from you, whom you shall father, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of Yahweh which you have spoken. He said moreover, Isn`t it so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, aren`t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his place.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Hephzibah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped all the host of the sky, and served them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He built altars in the house of Yahweh, whereof Yahweh said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He built altars for all the host of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He made his son to pass through the fire, and practiced sorcery, and used enchantments, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He set the engraved image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which Yahweh said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But they didn`t listen: and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yahweh spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring such evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, aren`t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and he forsook Yahweh, the God of his fathers, and didn`t walk in the way of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, aren`t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his place.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in all the way of David his father, and didn`t turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">It happened in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Yahweh, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yahweh, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of Yahweh, to repair the breaches of the house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">However there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh. Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. Shaphan read it before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">It happened, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king`s servant, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Go you, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they talked with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">She said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Tell you the man who sent you to me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on the inhabitants of it, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus shall you tell him, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: As touching the words which you have heard,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">because your heart was tender, and you did humble yourself before Yahweh, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place. They brought the king word again.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all [his] heart, and all [his] soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book: and all the people stood to the covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring forth out of the temple of Yahweh all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of the sky, and he burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He brought out the Asherah from the house of Yahweh, outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast the dust of it on the graves of the common people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of Yahweh, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man`s left hand at the gate of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nevertheless the priests of the high places didn`t come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of Yahweh, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Yahweh, did the king break down, and beat [them] down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mountain of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As Josiah turned himself, he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain; and he sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Yahweh which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he said, What monument is that which I see? The men of the city told him, It is the tomb of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, Let him be; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">All the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke [Yahweh] to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He killed all the priests of the high places that were there, on the altars, and burned men`s bones on them; and he returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this Passover kept to Yahweh in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Moreover those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Like him was there no king before him, who turned to Yahweh with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Notwithstanding, Yahweh didn`t turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Yahweh said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, aren`t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">In his days Pharaoh-necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and [Pharaoh-necoh] killed him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">His servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. The people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father`s place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Pharaoh-necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of everyone according to his taxation, to give it to Pharaoh-necoh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Surely at the commandment of Yahweh came this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and Yahweh would not pardon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem.</VERS>
