  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="20" bname="Proverbs" bsname="Pro">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To learn wisdom and moral instruction, and to discern wise counsel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">To receive moral instruction in skillful living, in righteousness, justice, and equity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">To impart shrewdness to the morally naive, and a discerning plan to the young person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">(Let the wise also hear and gain instruction, and let the discerning acquire guidance! )</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">To discern the meaning of a proverb and a parable, the sayings of the wise and their riddles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Fearing the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is the beginning of moral knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Listen, my child, to the instruction from your father, and do not forsake the teaching from your mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they will be like an elegant garland on your head, and like pendants around your neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">My child, if sinners try to entice you, do not consent!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If they say, "Come with us! We will lie in wait to shed blood; we will ambush an innocent person capriciously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">We will swallow them alive like Sheol, those full of vigor like those going down to the Pit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We will seize all kinds of precious wealth; we will fill our houses with plunder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Join with us! We will all share equally in what we steal."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">My child, do not go down their way, withhold yourself from their path;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">for they are eager to inflict harm, and they hasten to shed blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Surely it is futile to spread a net in plain sight of any bird,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">but these men lie in wait for their own blood, they ambush their own lives!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Such are the ways of all who gain profit unjustly; it takes away the life of those who obtain it!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wisdom calls out in the street, she shouts loudly in the plazas;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">at the head of the noisy streets she calls, in the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her words:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">"How long will you simpletons love naiveté? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If only you will respond to my rebuke, then I will pour out my thoughts to you and I will make my words known to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">However, because I called but you refused to listen, because I stretched out my hand but no one paid attention,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">because you neglected all my advice, and did not comply with my rebuke,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">so I myself will laugh when disaster strikes you, I will mock when what you dread comes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">when what you dread comes like a whirlwind, and disaster strikes you like a devastating storm, when distressing trouble comes on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then they will call to me, but I will not answer; they will diligently seek me, but they will not find me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Because they hated moral knowledge, and did not choose to fear the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">they did not comply with my advice, they spurned all my rebuke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore they will eat from the fruit of their way, and they will be stuffed full of their own counsel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the waywardness of the simpletons will kill them, and the careless ease of fools will destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But the one who listens to me will live in security, and will be at ease from the dread of harm.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My child, if you receive my words, and store up my commands within you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">by making your ear attentive to wisdom, and by turning your heart to understanding,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">indeed, if you call out for discernment - raise your voice for understanding -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">if you seek it like silver, and search for it like hidden treasure,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">then you will understand how to fear the Lord,and you will discover knowledge about God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> gives wisdom, and from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He stores up effective counsel for the upright, and is like a shield for those who live with integrity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">to guard the paths of the righteous and to protect the way of his pious ones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity - every good way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For wisdom will enter your heart, and moral knowledge will be attractive to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Discretion will protect you, understanding will guard you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">to deliver you from the way of the wicked, from those speaking perversity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">who leave the upright paths to walk on the dark ways,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">who delight in doing evil, they rejoice in perverse evil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">whose paths are morally crooked, and who are devious in their ways;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to deliver you from the adulteress, from the sexually loose woman who speaks flattering words;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">who leaves the husband from her younger days, and forgets her marriage covenant made before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For her house sinks down to death, and her paths lead to the place of the departed spirits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">None who go in to her will return, nor will they reach the paths of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So you will walk in the way of good people, and will keep on the paths of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the upright will reside in the land, and those with integrity will remain in it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">but the wicked will be removed from the land, and the treacherous will be torn away from it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My child, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">for they will provide a long and full life, and they will add well-being to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do not let truth and mercy leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then you will find favor and good understanding, in the sight of God and people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Trust in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Acknowledge him in all your ways, and he will make your paths straight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Do not be wise in your own estimation; fear the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and turn away from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This will bring healing to your body, and refreshment to your inner self.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Honor the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> from your wealth and from the first fruits of all your crops;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">then your barns will be filled completely, and your vats will overflow with new wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My child, do not despise discipline from the Lord,and do not loathe his rebuke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> disciplines those he loves, just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who obtains understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For her benefit is more profitable than silver, and her gain is better than gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">She is more precious than rubies, and none of the things you desire can compare with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Her ways are very pleasant, and all her paths are peaceful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She is like a tree of life to those who obtain her, and everyone who grasps hold of her will be blessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">By wisdom the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> laid the foundation of the earth; he established the heavens by understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">By his knowledge the primordial sea was broken open, and the clouds drip down dew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">My child, do not let them escape from your sight; safeguard sound wisdom and discretion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So they will give life to you, and grace to adorn your neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then you will walk on your way with security, and you will not stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When you lie down you will not be filled with fear; when you lie down your sleep will be pleasant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">You will not be afraid of sudden disaster, or when destruction overtakes the wicked;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will be the source of your confidence, and he will guard your foot from being caught in a trap.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Do not withhold good from those who need it, when you have the ability to help.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Do not say to your neighbor, "Go! Return tomorrow and I will give it," when you have it with you at the time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Do not plot evil against your neighbor when he dwells by you unsuspectingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Do not accuse anyone without legitimate cause, if he has not treated you wrongly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Do not envy a violent man, and do not choose to imitate any of his ways;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">for one who goes astray is an abomination to the Lord,but he reveals his intimate counsel to the upright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s curse is on the household of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Although he is scornful to arrogant scoffers, yet he shows favor to the humble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The wise inherit honor, but he holds fools up to public contempt.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Listen, children, to a father's instruction, and pay attention so that you may gain discernment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Because I give you good instruction, do not forsake my teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When I was a son to my father, a tender only child before my mother,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">he taught me, and he said to me: "Let your heart lay hold of my words; keep my commands so that you will live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding; do not forget and do not turn aside from the words I speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will guard you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wisdom is supreme - so acquire wisdom, and whatever you acquire, acquire understanding!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Esteem her highly and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">She will place a fair garland on your head; she will bestow a beautiful crown on you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Listen, my child, and accept my words, so that the years of your life will be many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I will guide you in the way of wisdom and I will lead you in upright paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When you walk, your steps will not be hampered, and when you run, you will not stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; protect it, because it is your life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Do not enter the path of the wicked or walk in the way of those who are evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Avoid it, do not go on it; turn away from it, and go on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For they cannot sleep unless they cause harm; they are robbed of sleep until they make someone stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For they eat bread gained from wickedness and drink wine obtained from violence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light, growing brighter and brighter until full day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The way of the wicked is like gloomy darkness; they do not know what causes them to stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My child, pay attention to my words; listen attentively to my sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Do not let them depart from your sight, guard them within your heart;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">for they are life to those who find them and healing to one's entire body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Guard your heart with all vigilance, for from it are the sources of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Remove perverse speech from your mouth; keep devious talk far from your lips.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let your eyes look directly in front of you and let your gaze look straight before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Make the path for your feet level, so that all your ways may be established.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Do not turn to the right or to the left; turn yourself away from evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My child, be attentive to my wisdom, pay close attention to my understanding,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in order to safeguard discretion, and that your lips may guard knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her seductive words are smoother than olive oil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Lest she should make level the path leading to life, her paths are unstable but she does not know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So now, children, listen to me; do not turn aside from the words I speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Keep yourself far from her, and do not go near the door of her house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">lest you give your vigor to others and your years to a cruel person,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">lest strangers devour your strength, and your labor benefit another man's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And at the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and your body are wasted away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And you will say, "How I hated discipline! My heart spurned reproof!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I did not obey my teachers and I did not heed my instructors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I almost came to complete ruin in the midst of the whole congregation!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Drink water from your own cistern and running water from your own well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Should your springs be dispersed outside, your streams of water in the wide plazas?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in your young wife -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">a loving doe, a graceful deer; may her breasts satisfy you at all times, may you be captivated by her love always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But why should you be captivated, my son, by an adulteress, and embrace the bosom of a different woman?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the ways of a person are in front of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s eyes, and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> weighs all that person's paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The wicked will be captured by his own iniquities, and he will be held by the cords of his own sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He will die because there was no discipline; because of the greatness of his folly he will reel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My child, if you have made a pledge for your neighbor, and have become a guarantor for a stranger,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">if you have been ensnared by the words you have uttered, and have been caught by the words you have spoken,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">then, my child, do this in order to deliver yourself, because you have fallen into your neighbor's power: go, humble yourself, and appeal firmly to your neighbor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Permit no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a snare, and like a bird from the trap of the fowler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Go to the ant, you sluggard; observe its ways and be wise!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">It has no commander, overseer, or ruler,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">yet it prepares its food in the summer; it gathers at the harvest what it will eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">How long, you sluggard, will you lie there? When will you rise from your sleep?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to relax,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and your poverty will come like a robber, and your need like an armed man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A worthless and wicked person walks around saying perverse things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">he winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, and points with his fingers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">he plots evil with perverse thoughts in his heart, he spreads contention at all times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly; in an instant he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There are six things that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> hates, even seven things that are an abomination to him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that are swift to run to evil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">a false witness who pours out lies, and a person who spreads discord among family members.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My child, guard the commands of your father and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Bind them on your heart continually; fasten them around your neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When you walk about, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; when you wake up, they will talk to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the commandments are like a lamp, instruction is like a light, and rebukes of discipline are like the road leading to life,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">by keeping you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the loose woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Do not lust in your heart for her beauty, and do not let her captivate you with her alluring eyes;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for on account of a prostitute one is brought down to a loaf of bread, but the wife of another man preys on your precious life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Can a man hold fire against his chest without burning his clothes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So it is with the one who has sex with his neighbor's wife; no one who touches her will escape punishment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">People do not despise a thief when he steals to fulfill his need when he is hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Yet if he is caught he must repay seven times over, he might even have to give all the wealth of his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">A man who commits adultery with a woman lacks wisdom, whoever does it destroys his own life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He will be beaten and despised, and his reproach will not be wiped away;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">for jealousy kindles a husband's rage, and he will not show mercy when he takes revenge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He will not consider any compensation; he will not be willing, even if you multiply the compensation.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My child, keep my words and treasure up my commands in your own keeping.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Keep my commands so that you may live, and obey my instruction as your most prized possession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Bind them on your forearm; write them on the tablet of your heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call understanding a close relative,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">so that they may keep you from the adulterous woman, from the loose woman who flatters you with her words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For at the window of my house through my window lattice I looked out</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and I saw among the naive - I discerned among the youths - a young man who lacked wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He was passing by the street near her corner, making his way along the road to her house</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">in the twilight, the evening, in the dark of the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Suddenly a woman came out to meet him! She was dressed like a prostitute and with secret intent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">(She is loud and rebellious, she does not remain at home -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">at one time outside, at another in the wide plazas, and by every corner she lies in wait.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So she grabbed him and kissed him, and with a bold expression she said to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"I have fresh meat at home; today I have fulfilled my vows!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That is why I came out to meet you, to look for you, and I found you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I have spread my bed with elegant coverings, with richly colored fabric from Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Come, let's drink deeply of lovemaking until morning, let's delight ourselves with sexual intercourse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a journey of some distance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He has taken a bag of money with him; he will not return until the end of the month."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She persuaded him with persuasive words; with her smooth talk she compelled him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Suddenly he went after her like an ox that goes to the slaughter, like a stag prancing into a trapper's snare</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">till an arrow pierces his liver - like a bird hurrying into a trap, and he does not know that it will cost him his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So now, sons, listen to me, and pay attention to the words I speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways - do not wander into her pathways;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">for she has brought down many fatally wounded, and all those she has slain are many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Her house is the way to the grave, going down to the chambers of death.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Does not wisdom call out? Does not understanding raise her voice?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">At the top of the elevated places along the way, at the intersection of the paths she takes her stand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">beside the gates opening into the city, at the entrance of the doorways she cries out:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">"To you, O people, I call out, and my voice calls to all mankind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You who are naive, discern wisdom! And you fools, understand discernment!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Listen, for I will speak excellent things, and my lips will utter what is right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For my mouth speaks truth, and my lips hate wickedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing in them twisted or crooked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All of them are clear to the discerning and upright to those who find knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Receive my instruction rather than silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For wisdom is better than rubies, and desirable things cannot be compared to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"I, wisdom, live with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The fear of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is to hate evil; I hate arrogant pride and the evil way and perverse utterances.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh; an oracle: This man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ukal:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Surely I am more brutish than any other human being, and I do not have human understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I have not learned wisdom, nor do I have knowledge of the Holy One.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Who has ascended into heaven, and then descended? Who has gathered up the winds in his fists? Who has bound up the waters in his cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name? - if you know!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Every word of God is purified; he is like a shield for those who take refuge in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Do not add to his words, lest he reprove you, and prove you to be a liar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Two things I ask from you; do not refuse me before I die:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Remove falsehood and lies far from me; do not give me poverty or riches, feed me with my allotted portion of bread,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">lest I become satisfied and act deceptively and say, "Who is the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>?" Or lest I become poor and steal and demean the name of my God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Do not slander a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you are found guilty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is a generation who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There is a generation who are pure in their own eyes and yet are not washed from their filthiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There is a generation whose eyes are so lofty, and whose eyelids are lifted up disdainfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">There is a generation whose teeth are like swords and whose molars are like knives to devour the poor from the earth and the needy from among the human race.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The leech has two daughters: "Give! Give!" There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, "Enough" -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">the grave, the barren womb, land that is not satisfied with water, and fire that never says, "Enough!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The eye that mocks at a father and despises obeying a mother - the ravens of the valley will peck it out and the young vultures will eat it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There are three things that are too wonderful for me, four that I do not understand:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship in the sea, and the way of a man with a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">This is the way of an adulterous woman: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, "I have not done wrong."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Under three things the earth trembles, and under four things it cannot bear up:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">under a servant who becomes king, under a fool who is stuffed with food,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">under an unloved woman who is married, and under a female servant who dispossesses her mistress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">There are four things on earth that are small, but they are exceedingly wise:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">ants are creatures with little strength, but they prepare their food in the summer;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">rock badgers are creatures with little power, but they make their homes in the crags;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">locusts have no king, but they all go forward by ranks;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">a lizard you can catch with the hand, but it gets into the palaces of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">There are three things that are magnificent in their step, four things that move about magnificently:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">a lion, mightiest of the beasts, who does not retreat from anything;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">a strutting rooster, a male goat, and a king with his army around him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">If you have done foolishly by exalting yourself or if you have planned evil, put your hand over your mouth!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For as the churning of milk produces butter and as punching the nose produces blood, so stirring up anger produces strife.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="31">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of King Lemuel, an oracle that his mother taught him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">O my son, O son of my womb, O son of my vows,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do not give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which ruins kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to crave strong drink,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">lest they drink and forget what is decreed, and remove from all the poor their legal rights.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, and wine to those who are bitterly distressed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">let them drink and forget their poverty, and remember their misery no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak, for the legal rights of all the dying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Open your mouth, judge in righteousness, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Who can find a wife of noble character? For her value is far more than rubies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The heart of her husband has confidence in her, and he has no lack of gain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She brings him good and not evil all the days of her life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">She obtains wool and flax, and she is pleased to work with her hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">She is like the merchant ships; she brings her food from afar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">She also gets up while it is still night, and provides food for her household and a portion to her female servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">She considers a field and buys it; from her own income she plants a vineyard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">She begins her work vigorously, and she strengthens her arms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She knows that her merchandise is good, and her lamp does not go out in the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Her hands take hold of the distaff, and her hands grasp the spindle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">She extends her hand to the poor, and reaches out her hand to the needy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She is not afraid of the snow for her household, for all of her household are clothed with scarlet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">She makes for herself coverlets; her clothing is fine linen and purple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Her husband is well-known in the city gate when he sits with the elders of the land.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Futile! Futile!" laments the Teacher, "Absolutely futile! Everything is futile!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">What benefit do people get from all the effort which they expend on earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">A generation comes and a generation goes, but the earth remains the same through the ages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The sun rises and the sun sets; it hurries away to a place from which it rises again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The wind goes to the south and circles around to the north; round and round the wind goes and on its rounds it returns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All the streams flow into the sea, but the sea is not full, and to the place where the streams flow, there they will flow again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All this monotony is tiresome; no one can bear to describe it: The eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor is the ear ever content with hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What exists now is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; there is nothing truly new on earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Is there anything about which someone can say, "Look at this! It is new!"? It was already done long ago, before our time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">No one remembers the former events, nor will anyone remember the events that are yet to happen; they will not be remembered by the future generations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I decided to carefully and thoroughly examine all that has been accomplished on earth. I concluded: God has given people a burdensome task that keeps them occupied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I reflected on everything that is accomplished by man on earth, and I concluded: Everything he has accomplished is futile - like chasing the wind!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What is bent cannot be straightened, and what is missing cannot be supplied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I thought to myself, "I have become much wiser than any of my predecessors who ruled over Jerusalem; I have acquired much wisdom and knowledge."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So I decided to discern the benefit of wisdom and knowledge over foolish behavior and ideas; however, I concluded that even this endeavor is like trying to chase the wind!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For with great wisdom comes great frustration; whoever increases his knowledge merely increases his heartache.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I thought to myself, "Come now, I will try self-indulgent pleasure to see if it is worthwhile." But I found that it also is futile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I said of partying, "It is folly," and of self-indulgent pleasure, "It accomplishes nothing!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I thought deeply about the effects of indulging myself with wine (all the while my mind was guiding me with wisdom) and the effects of behaving foolishly, so that I might discover what is profitable for people to do on earth during the few days of their lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I increased my possessions: I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I designed royal gardens and parks for myself, and I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I constructed pools of water for myself, to irrigate my grove of flourishing trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I purchased male and female slaves, and I owned slaves who were born in my house; I also possessed more livestock - both herds and flocks - than any of my predecessors in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I also amassed silver and gold for myself, as well as valuable treasures taken from kingdoms and provinces. I acquired male singers and female singers for myself, and what gives a man sensual delight - a harem of beautiful concubines!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So I was far wealthier than all my predecessors in Jerusalem, yet I maintained my objectivity:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I did not restrain myself from getting whatever I wanted; I did not deny myself anything that would bring me pleasure. So all my accomplishments gave me joy; this was my reward for all my effort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yet when I reflected on everything I had accomplished and on all the effort that I had expended to accomplish it, I concluded: "All these achievements and possessions are ultimately profitless - like chasing the wind! There is nothing gained from them on earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Next, I decided to consider wisdom, as well as foolish behavior and ideas. For what more can the king's successor do than what the king has already done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I realized that wisdom is preferable to folly, just as light is preferable to darkness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The wise man can see where he is going, but the fool walks in darkness. Yet I also realized that the same fate happens to them both.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So I thought to myself, "The fate of the fool will happen even to me! Then what did I gain by becoming so excessively wise?" So I lamented to myself, "The benefits of wisdom are ultimately meaningless!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For the wise man, like the fool, will not be remembered for very long, because in the days to come, both will already have been forgotten. Alas, the wise man dies - just like the fool!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So I loathed life because what happens on earth seems awful to me; for all the benefits of wisdom are futile - like chasing the wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So I loathed all the fruit of my effort, for which I worked so hard on earth, because I must leave it behind in the hands of my successor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Who knows if he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will be master over all the fruit of my labor for which I worked so wisely on earth! This also is futile!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So I began to despair about all the fruit of my labor for which I worked so hard on earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge, and skill; however, he must hand over the fruit of his labor as an inheritance to someone else who did not work for it. This also is futile, and an awful injustice!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What does a man acquire from all his labor and from the anxiety that accompanies his toil on earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For all day long his work produces pain and frustration, and even at night his mind cannot relax! This also is futile!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">There is nothing better for people than to eat and drink, and to find enjoyment in their work. I also perceived that this ability to find enjoyment comes from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For no one can eat and drink or experience joy apart from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For to the one who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy, but to the sinner, he gives the task of amassing wealth - only to give it to the one who pleases God. This task of the wicked is futile - like chasing the wind!</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For everything there is an appointed time, and an appropriate time for every activity on earth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to uproot what was planted;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">A time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">A time to search, and a time to give something up as lost; a time to keep, and a time to throw away;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">A time to rip, and a time to sew; a time to keep silent, and a time to speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">A time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What benefit can a worker gain from his toil?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I have observed the burden that God has given to people to keep them occupied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God has made everything fit beautifully in its appropriate time, but he has also placed ignorance in the human heart so that people cannot discover what God has ordained, from the beginning to the end of their lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I have concluded that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to enjoy themselves as long as they live,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and also that everyone should eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all his toil, for these things are a gift from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I also know that whatever God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken away from it. God has made it this way, so that men will fear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Whatever exists now has already been, and whatever will be has already been; for God will seek to do again what has occurred in the past.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I saw something else on earth: In the place of justice, there was wickedness, and in the place of fairness, there was wickedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I thought to myself, "God will judge both the righteous and the wicked; for there is an appropriate time for every activity, and there is a time of judgment for every deed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I also thought to myself, "It is for the sake of people, so God can clearly show them that they are like animals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the fate of humans and the fate of animals are the same: As one dies, so dies the other; both have the same breath. There is no advantage for humans over animals, for both are fleeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Both go to the same place, both come from the dust, and to dust both return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Who really knows if the human spirit ascends upward, and the animal's spirit descends into the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So I perceived there is nothing better than for people to enjoy their work, because that is their reward; for who can show them what the future holds?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So I again considered all the oppression that continually occurs on earth. This is what I saw: The oppressed were in tears,  but no one was comforting them; no one delivers them from the power of their oppressors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So I considered those who are dead and gone more fortunate than those who are still alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But better than both is the one who has not been born and has not seen the evil things that are done on earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then I considered all the skillful work that is done: Surely it is nothing more than competition between one person and another. This also is profitless - like chasing the wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The fool folds his hands and does no work, so he has nothing to eat but his own flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Better is one handful with some rest than two hands full of toil and chasing the wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So I again considered another futile thing on earth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">A man who is all alone with no companion, he has no children nor siblings; yet there is no end to all his toil, and he is never satisfied with riches. He laments, "For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?" This also is futile and a burdensome task!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Two people are better than one, because they can reap more benefit from their labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if they fall, one will help his companion up, but pity the person who falls down and has no one to help him up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Furthermore, if two lie down together, they can keep each other warm, but how can one person keep warm by himself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Although an assailant may overpower one person, two can withstand him. Moreover, a three-stranded cord is not quickly broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">A poor but wise youth is better than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to receive advice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For he came out of prison to become king, even though he had been born poor in what would become his kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I considered all the living who walk on earth, as well as the successor who would arise in his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There is no end to all the people nor to the past generations, yet future generations will not rejoice in him. This also is profitless and like chasing the wind.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Be careful what you do when you go to the temple of God; draw near to listen rather than to offer a sacrifice like fools, for they do not realize that they are doing wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Do not be rash with your mouth or hasty in your heart to bring up a matter before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth! Therefore, let your words be few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Just as dreams come when there are many cares, so the rash vow of a fool occurs when there are many words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When you make a vow to God, do not delay in paying it. For God takes no pleasure in fools: Pay what you vow!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It is better for you not to vow than to vow and not pay it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Do not let your mouth cause you to sin, and do not tell the priest, "It was a mistake!" Why make God angry at you so that he would destroy the work of your hands?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Just as there is futility in many dreams, so also in many words. Therefore, fear God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If you see the extortion of the poor, or the perversion of justice and fairness in the government, do not be astonished by the matter. For the high official is watched by a higher official, and there are higher ones over them!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The produce of the land is seized by all of them, even the king is served by the fields.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The one who loves money will never be satisfied with money, he who loves wealth will never be satisfied with his income. This also is futile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When someone's prosperity increases, those who consume it also increase; so what does its owner gain, except that he gets to see it with his eyes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The sleep of the laborer is pleasant - whether he eats little or much - but the wealth of the rich will not allow him to sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Here is a misfortune on earth that I have seen: Wealth hoarded by its owner to his own misery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then that wealth was lost through bad luck; although he fathered a son, he has nothing left to give him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Just as he came forth from his mother's womb, naked will he return as he came, and he will take nothing in his hand that he may carry away from his toil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This is another misfortune: Just as he came, so will he go. What did he gain from toiling for the wind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Surely, he ate in darkness every day of his life, and he suffered greatly with sickness and anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I have seen personally what is the only beneficial and appropriate course of action for people: to eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all their hard work on earth during the few days of their life which God has given them, for this is their reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">To every man whom God has given wealth, and possessions, he has also given him the ability to eat from them, to receive his reward and to find enjoyment in his toil; these things are the gift of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For he does not think much about the fleeting days of his life because God keeps him preoccupied with the joy he derives from his activity.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Here is another misfortune that I have seen on earth, and it weighs heavily on people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God gives a man riches, property, and wealth so that he lacks nothing that his heart desires, yet God does not enable him to enjoy the fruit of his labor - instead, someone else enjoys it! This is fruitless and a grave misfortune.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Even if a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years - even if he lives a long, long time, but cannot enjoy his prosperity - even if he were to live forever -  I would say, "A stillborn child is better off than he is!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Though the stillborn child came into the world for no reason and departed into darkness, though its name is shrouded in darkness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">though it never saw the light of day nor knew anything, yet it has more rest than that man -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">if he should live a thousand years twice, yet does not enjoy his prosperity. For both of them die!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All of man's labor is for nothing more than to fill his stomach - yet his appetite is never satisfied!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So what advantage does a wise man have over a fool? And what advantage does a pauper gain by knowing how to survive?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It is better to be content with what the eyes can see than for one's heart always to crave more. This continual longing is futile - like chasing the wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Whatever has happened was foreordained, and what happens to a person was also foreknown. It is useless for him to argue with God about his fate because God is more powerful than he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The more one argues with words, the less he accomplishes. How does that benefit him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For no one knows what is best for a person during his life - during the few days of his fleeting life -  for they pass away like a shadow. Nor can anyone tell him what the future will hold for him on earth.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">A good reputation is better than precious perfume; likewise, the day of one's death is better than the day of one's birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It is better to go to a funeral than a feast. For death is the destiny of every person, and the living should take this to heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Sorrow is better than laughter, because sober reflection is good for the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of merrymaking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It is better for a person to receive a rebuke from those who are wise than to listen to the song of fools.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For like the crackling of quick-burning thorns under a cooking pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This kind of folly also is useless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Surely oppression can turn a wise person into a fool; likewise, a bribe corrupts the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The end of a matter is better than its beginning; likewise, patience is better than pride.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do not let yourself be quickly provoked, for anger resides in the lap of fools.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Do not say, "Why were the old days better than these days?" for it is not wise to ask that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing; it benefits those who see the light of day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For wisdom provides protection, just as money provides protection. But the advantage of knowledge is this: Wisdom preserves the life of its owner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Consider the work of God: For who can make straight what he has bent?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In times of prosperity be joyful, but in times of adversity consider this: God has made one as well as the other, so that no one can discover what the future holds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">During the days of my fleeting life I have seen both of these things: Sometimes a righteous person dies prematurely in spite of his righteousness, and sometimes a wicked person lives long in spite of his evil deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So do not be excessively righteous or excessively wise; otherwise you might be disappointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool; otherwise you might die before your time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">It is best to take hold of one warning without letting go of the other warning; for the one who fears God will follow both warnings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Wisdom gives a wise person more protection than ten rulers in a city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For there is not one truly righteous person on the earth who continually does good and never sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Also, do not pay attention to everything that people say; otherwise, you might even hear your servant cursing you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For you know in your own heart that you also have cursed others many times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I have examined all this by wisdom; I said, "I am determined to comprehend this" - but it was beyond my grasp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Whatever has happened is beyond human understanding; it is far deeper than anyone can fathom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I tried to understand, examine, and comprehend the role of wisdom in the scheme of things, and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the insanity of folly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I discovered this: More bitter than death is the kind of woman who is like a hunter's snare; her heart is like a hunter's net and her hands are like prison chains. The man who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is captured by her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The Teacher says: I discovered this while trying to discover the scheme of things, item by item.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">What I have continually sought, I have not found; I have found only one upright man among a thousand, but I have not found one upright woman among all of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">This alone have I discovered: God made humankind upright, but they have sought many evil schemes.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Who is a wise person? Who knows the solution to a problem? A person's wisdom brightens his appearance, and softens his harsh countenance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Obey the king's command, because you took an oath before God to be loyal to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do not rush out of the king's presence in haste - do not delay when the matter is unpleasant, for he can do whatever he pleases.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Surely the king's authority is absolute; no one can say to him, "What are you doing?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Whoever obeys his command will not experience harm, and a wise person knows the proper time and procedure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, for the oppression of the king is severe upon his victim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Surely no one knows the future, and no one can tell another person what will happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Just as no one has power over the wind to restrain it, so no one has power over the day of his death. Just as no one can be discharged during the battle, so wickedness cannot rescue the wicked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">While applying my mind to everything that happens in this world, I have seen all this: Sometimes one person dominates other people to their harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Not only that, but I have seen the wicked approaching and entering the temple, and as they left the holy temple, they boasted in the city that they had done so. This also is an enigma.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When a sentence is not executed at once against a crime, the human heart is encouraged to do evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Even though a sinner might commit a hundred crimes and still live a long time, yet I know that it will go well with God-fearing people - for they stand in fear before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But it will not go well with the wicked, nor will they prolong their days like a shadow, because they do not stand in fear before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Here is another enigma that occurs on earth: Sometimes there are righteous people who get what the wicked deserve, and sometimes there are wicked people who get what the righteous deserve. I said, "This also is an enigma."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So I recommend the enjoyment of life, for there is nothing better on earth for a person to do except to eat, drink, and enjoy life. So joy will accompany him in his toil during the days of his life which God gives him on earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When I tried to gain wisdom and to observe the activity on earth - even though it prevents anyone from sleeping day or night -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">then I discerned all that God has done: No one really comprehends what happens on earth. Despite all human efforts to discover it, no one can ever grasp it. Even if a wise person claimed that he understood, he would not really comprehend it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So I reflected on all this, attempting to clear it all up. I concluded that the righteous and the wise, as well as their works, are in the hand of God; whether a person will be loved or hated - no one knows what lies ahead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Everyone shares the same fate - the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the ceremonially clean and unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. What happens to the good person, also happens to the sinner; what happens to those who make vows, also happens to those who are afraid to make vows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">This is the unfortunate fact about everything that happens on earth: the same fate awaits everyone. In addition to this, the hearts of all people are full of evil, and there is folly in their hearts during their lives - then they die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But whoever is among the living has hope; a live dog is better than a dead lion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For the living know that they will die, but the dead do not know anything; they have no further reward - and even the memory of them disappears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">What they loved, as well as what they hated and envied, perished long ago, and they no longer have a part in anything that happens on earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Go, eat your food with joy, and drink your wine with a happy heart, because God has already approved your works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Let your clothes always be white, and do not spare precious ointment on your head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Enjoy life with your beloved wife during all the days of your fleeting life that God has given you on earth during all your fleeting days; for that is your reward in life and in your burdensome work on earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Whatever you find to do with your hands, do it with all your might, because there is neither work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave, the place where you will eventually go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Again, I observed this on the earth: the race is not always won by the swiftest, the battle is not always won by the strongest; prosperity does not always belong to those who are the wisest, wealth does not always belong to those who are the most discerning, nor does success always come to those with the most knowledge - for time and chance may overcome them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Surely, no one knows his appointed time! Like fish that are caught in a deadly net, and like birds that are caught in a snare - just like them, all people are ensnared at an unfortunate time that falls upon them suddenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">This is what I also observed about wisdom on earth, and it is a great burden to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">There was once a small city with a few men in it, and a mighty king attacked it, besieging it and building strong siege works against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">However, a poor but wise man lived in the city, and he could have delivered the city by his wisdom, but no one listened to that poor man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So I concluded that wisdom is better than might, but a poor man's wisdom is despised; no one ever listens to his advice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The words of the wise are heard in quiet, more than the shouting of a ruler is heard among fools.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner can destroy much that is good.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">One dead fly makes the perfumer's ointment give off a rancid stench, so a little folly can outweigh much wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A wise person's good sense protects him, but a fool's lack of sense leaves him vulnerable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Even when a fool walks along the road he lacks sense, and shows everyone what a fool he is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If the anger of the ruler flares up against you, do not resign from your position, for a calm response can undo great offenses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I have seen another misfortune on the earth: It is an error a ruler makes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Fools are placed in many positions of authority, while wealthy men sit in lowly positions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I have seen slaves on horseback and princes walking on foot like slaves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">One who digs a pit may fall into it, and one who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">One who quarries stones may be injured by them; one who splits logs may be endangered by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">If an iron axhead is blunt and a workman does not sharpen its edge, he must exert a great deal of effort; so wisdom has the advantage of giving success.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If the snake should bite before it is charmed, the snake charmer is in trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The words of a wise person win him favor, but the words of a fool are self-destructive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">At the beginning his words are foolish and at the end his talk is wicked madness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">yet a fool keeps on babbling. No one knows what will happen; who can tell him what will happen in the future?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The toil of a stupid fool wears him out, because he does not even know the way to the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Woe to you, O land, when your king is childish, and your princes feast in the morning!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobility, and your princes feast at the proper time - with self-control and not in drunkenness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Because of laziness the roof caves in, and because of idle hands the house leaks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Feasts are made for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Listen, O heavens, pay attention, O earth! For the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> speaks: "I raised children, I brought them up, but they have rebelled against me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">An ox recognizes its owner, a donkey recognizes where its owner puts its food; but Israel does not recognize me, my people do not understand."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The sinful nation is as good as dead, the people weighed down by evil deeds. They are offspring who do wrong, children who do wicked things. They have abandoned the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, and rejected the Holy One of Israel. They are alienated from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Why do you insist on being battered? Why do you continue to rebel? Your head has a massive wound, your whole body is weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">From the soles of your feet to your head, there is no spot that is unharmed. There are only bruises, cuts, and open wounds. They have not been cleansed or bandaged, nor have they been treated with olive oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Your land is devastated, your cities burned with fire. Right before your eyes your crops are being destroyed by foreign invaders. They leave behind devastation and destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Daughter Zion is left isolated, like a hut in a vineyard, or a shelter in a cucumber field; she is a besieged city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who commands armies had not left us a few survivors, we would have quickly become like Sodom, we would have become like Gomorrah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Listen to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s word, you leaders of Sodom! Pay attention to our God's rebuke, people of Gomorrah!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">I hate your new moon festivals and assemblies; they are a burden that I am tired of carrying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When you spread out your hands in prayer, I look the other way; when you offer your many prayers, I do not listen, because your hands are covered with blood.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Seraphs stood over him; each one had six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and they used the remaining two to fly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They called out to one another, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord who commands armies! His majestic splendor fills the entire earth!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The sound of their voices shook the door frames, and the temple was filled with smoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I said, "Too bad for me! I am destroyed, for my lips are contaminated by sin, and I live among people whose lips are contaminated by sin. My eyes have seen the king, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who commands armies."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But then one of the seraphs flew toward me. In his hand was a hot coal he had taken from the altar with tongs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He touched my mouth with it and said, "Look, this coal has touched your lips. Your evil is removed; your sin is forgiven."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I heard the voice of the sovereign master say, "Whom will I send? Who will go on our behalf?" I answered, "Here I am, send me!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said, "Go and tell these people:'Listen continually, but don't understand! Look continually, but don't perceive!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Make the hearts of these people calloused; make their ears deaf and their eyes blind! Otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears, their hearts might understand and they might repent and be healed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I replied, "How long, sovereign master?" He said, "Until cities are in ruins and unpopulated, and houses are uninhabited, and the land is ruined and devastated,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has sent the people off to a distant place, and the very heart of the land is completely abandoned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Even if only a tenth of the people remain in the land, it will again be destroyed, like one of the large sacred trees or an Asherah pole, when a sacred pillar on a high place is thrown down. That sacred pillar symbolizes the special chosen family."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">During the reign of Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel marched up to Jerusalem to do battle, but they were unable to prevail against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It was reported to the family of David, "Syria has allied with Ephraim." They and their people were emotionally shaken, just as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> told Isaiah, "Go out with your son Shear-jashub and meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool which is located on the road to the field where they wash and dry cloth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Tell him, 'Make sure you stay calm! Don't be afraid! Don't be intimidated by these two stubs of smoking logs, or by the raging anger of Rezin, Syria, and the son of Remaliah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Syria has plotted with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah to bring about your demise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They say, "Let's attack Judah, terrorize it, and conquer it. Then we'll set up the son of Tabeel as its king."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For this reason the sovereign master, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, says:"It will not take place; it will not happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For Syria's leader is Damascus, and the leader of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will no longer exist as a nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Ephraim's leader is Samaria, and Samaria's leader is the son of Remaliah. If your faith does not remain firm, then you will not remain secure."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> again spoke to Ahaz:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"Ask for a confirming sign from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God. You can even ask for something miraculous."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Ahaz responded, "I don't want to ask; I don't want to put the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> to a test."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Isaiah replied, "Pay attention, family of David. Do you consider it too insignificant to try the patience of men? Is that why you are also trying the patience of my God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For this reason the sovereign master himself will give you a confirming sign. Look, this young woman is about to conceive and will give birth to a son. You, young woman, will name him Immanuel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He will eat sour milk and honey, which will help him know how to reject evil and choose what is right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Here is why this will be so: Before the child knows how to reject evil and choose what is right, the land whose two kings you fear will be desolate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will bring on you, your people, and your father's family a time unlike any since Ephraim departed from Judah - the king of Assyria!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">At that time the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will whistle for flies from the distant streams of Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">All of them will come and make their home in the ravines between the cliffs, and in the crevices of the cliffs, in all the thorn bushes, and in all the watering holes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">At that time the sovereign master will use a razor hired from the banks of the Euphrates River, the king of Assyria, to shave the head and the pubic hair; it will also shave off the beard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">At that time a man will keep alive a young cow from the herd and a couple of goats.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">From the abundance of milk they produce, he will have sour milk for his meals. Indeed, everyone left in the heart of the land will eat sour milk and honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">At that time every place where there had been a thousand vines worth a thousand shekels will be overrun with thorns and briers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">With bow and arrow men will hunt there, for the whole land will be covered with thorns and briers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They will stay away from all the hills that were cultivated, for fear of the thorns and briers. Cattle will graze there and sheep will trample on them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> told me, "Take a large tablet and inscribe these words on it with an ordinary stylus: 'Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then I will summon as my reliable witnesses Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I then had sexual relations with the prophetess; she conceived and gave birth to a son. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> told me, "Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for before the child knows how to cry out, 'My father' or 'My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to me again:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"These people have rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and melt in fear over Rezin and the son of Remaliah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So look, the sovereign master is bringing up against them the turbulent and mighty waters of the Euphrates River - the king of Assyria and all his majestic power. It will reach flood stage and overflow its banks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It will spill into Judah, flooding and engulfing, as it reaches to the necks of its victims. He will spread his wings out over your entire land, O Immanuel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You will be broken, O nations; you will be shattered! Pay attention, all you distant lands of the earth! Get ready for battle, and you will be shattered! Get ready for battle, and you will be shattered!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted! Issue your orders, but they will not be executed! For God is with us!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Indeed this is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> told me. He took hold of me firmly and warned me not to act like these people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"Do not say, 'Conspiracy,' every time these people say the word. Don't be afraid of what scares them; don't be terrified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You must recognize the authority of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who commands armies. He is the one you must respect; he is the one you must fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He will become a sanctuary, but a stone that makes a person trip, and a rock that makes one stumble - to the two houses of Israel. He will become a trap and a snare to the residents of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Many will stumble over the stone and the rock, and will fall and be seriously injured, and will be ensnared and captured."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Tie up the scroll as legal evidence, seal the official record of God's instructions and give it to my followers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I will wait patiently for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, who has rejected the family of Jacob; I will wait for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Look, I and the sons whom the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has given me are reminders and object lessons in Israel, sent from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who commands armies, who lives on Mount Zion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They will say to you, "Seek oracles at the pits used to conjure up underworld spirits, from the magicians who chirp and mutter incantations. Should people not seek oracles from their gods, by asking the dead about the destiny of the living?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then you must recall the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s instructions and the prophetic testimony of what would happen. Certainly they say such things because their minds are spiritually darkened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They will pass through the land destitute and starving. Their hunger will make them angry, and they will curse their king and their God as they look upward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When one looks out over the land, he sees distress and darkness, gloom and anxiety, darkness and people forced from the land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The gloom will be dispelled for those who were anxious. In earlier times he humiliated the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali; but now he brings honor to the way of the sea, the region beyond the Jordan, and Galilee of the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The people walking in darkness see a bright light;  light shines on those who live in a land of deep darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You have enlarged the nation; you give them great joy. They rejoice in your presence as harvesters rejoice; as warriors celebrate when they divide up the plunder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For their oppressive yoke and the club that strikes their shoulders, the cudgel the oppressor uses on them, you have shattered, as in the day of Midian's defeat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Indeed every boot that marches and shakes the earth and every garment dragged through blood is used as fuel for the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For a child has been born to us, a son has been given to us. He shoulders responsibility and is called: Extraordinary Strategist, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">His dominion will be vast and he will bring immeasurable prosperity. He will rule on David's throne and over David's kingdom, establishing it and strengthening it by promoting justice and fairness, from this time forward and forevermore. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s intense devotion to his people will accomplish this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The sovereign master decreed judgment on Jacob, and it fell on Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All the people were aware of it, the people of Ephraim and those living in Samaria. Yet with pride and an arrogant attitude, they said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"The bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild with chiseled stone; the sycamore fig trees have been cut down, but we will replace them with cedars."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> provoked their adversaries to attack them, he stirred up their enemies -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Syria from the east, and the Philistines from the west, they gobbled up Israelite territory. Despite all this, his anger does not subside, and his hand is ready to strike again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The people did not return to the one who struck them, they did not seek reconciliation with the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who commands armies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> cut off Israel's head and tail, both the shoots and stalk in one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The leaders and the highly respected people are the head, the prophets who teach lies are the tail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The leaders of this nation were misleading people, and the people being led were destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So the sovereign master was not pleased with their young men, he took no pity on their orphans and widows; for the whole nation was godless and did wicked things, every mouth was speaking disgraceful words. Despite all this, his anger does not subside, and his hand is ready to strike again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For evil burned like a fire, it consumed thorns and briers; it burned up the thickets of the forest, and they went up in smoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Because of the anger of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who commands armies, the land was scorched, and the people became fuel for the fire. People had no compassion on one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">They devoured on the right, but were still hungry, they ate on the left, but were not satisfied. People even ate the flesh of their own arm!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Manasseh fought against Ephraim, and Ephraim against Manasseh; together they fought against Judah. Despite all this, his anger does not subside, and his hand is ready to strike again.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Those who enact unjust policies are as good as dead, those who are always instituting unfair regulations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to keep the poor from getting fair treatment, and to deprive the oppressed among my people of justice, so they can steal what widows own, and loot what belongs to orphans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">What will you do on judgment day, when destruction arrives from a distant place? To whom will you run for help? Where will you leave your wealth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You will have no place to go, except to kneel with the prisoners, or to fall among those who have been killed. Despite all this, his anger does not subside, and his hand is ready to strike again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Assyria, the club I use to vent my anger, is as good as dead, a cudgel with which I angrily punish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I sent him against a godless nation, I ordered him to attack the people with whom I was angry, to take plunder and to carry away loot, to trample them down like dirt in the streets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But he does not agree with this, his mind does not reason this way, for his goal is to destroy, and to eliminate many nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Indeed, he says: "Are not my officials all kings?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Is not Calneh like Carchemish? Hamath like Arpad? Samaria like Damascus?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I overpowered kingdoms ruled by idols, whose carved images were more impressive than Jerusalem's or Samaria's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As I have done to Samaria and its idols, so I will do to Jerusalem and its idols."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when the sovereign master finishes judging Mount Zion and Jerusalem, then I will punish the king of Assyria for what he has proudly planned and for the arrogant attitude he displays.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For he says:"By my strong hand I have accomplished this, by my strategy that I devised. I invaded the territory of nations, and looted their storehouses. Like a mighty conqueror, I brought down rulers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">My hand discovered the wealth of the nations, as if it were in a nest, as one gathers up abandoned eggs, I gathered up the whole earth. There was no wing flapping, or open mouth chirping."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Does an ax exalt itself over the one who wields it, or a saw magnify itself over the one who cuts with it? As if a scepter should brandish the one who raises it, or a staff should lift up what is not made of wood!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For this reason the sovereign master, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who commands armies, will make his healthy ones emaciated. His majestic glory will go up in smoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The light of Israel will become a fire, their Holy One will become a flame; it will burn and consume the Assyrian king's briers and his thorns in one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The splendor of his forest and his orchard will be completely destroyed, as when a sick man's life ebbs away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">There will be so few trees left in his forest, a child will be able to count them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">At that time those left in Israel, those who remain of the family of Jacob, will no longer rely on a foreign leader that abuses them. Instead they will truly rely on the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, the Holy One of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">A remnant will come back, a remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For though your people, Israel, are as numerous as the sand on the seashore, only a remnant will come back. Destruction has been decreed; just punishment is about to engulf you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The sovereign master, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who commands armies, is certainly ready to carry out the decreed destruction throughout the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So here is what the sovereign master, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who commands armies, says: "My people who live in Zion, do not be afraid of Assyria, even though they beat you with a club and lift their cudgel against you as Egypt did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For very soon my fury will subside, and my anger will be directed toward their destruction."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who commands armies is about to beat them with a whip, similar to the way he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb. He will use his staff against the sea, lifting it up as he did in Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">At that time the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will remove their burden from your shoulders, and their yoke from your neck; the yoke will be taken off because your neck will be too large.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They attacked Aiath, moved through Migron, depositing their supplies at Micmash.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They went through the pass, spent the night at Geba. Ramah trembled, Gibeah of Saul ran away.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Israel was set apart to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>; they were like the first fruits of a harvest to him. All who tried to devour them were punished; disaster came upon them," says the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now listen to what the Lord has to say, you descendants of Jacob, all you family groups from the nation of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">This is what the Lord says: "What fault could your ancestors have possibly found in me that they strayed so far from me? They paid allegiance to worthless idols, and so became worthless to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They did not ask: 'Where is the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who delivered us out of Egypt, who brought us through the wilderness, through a land of desert sands and rift valleys, through a land of drought and deep darkness, through a land in which no one travels, and where no one lives?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I brought you into a fertile land so you could enjoy its fruits and its rich bounty. But when you entered my land, you defiled it; you made the land I call my own loathsome to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Your priests did not ask, 'Where is the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>?' Those responsible for teaching my law did not really know me. Your rulers rebelled against me. Your prophets prophesied in the name of the god Baal. They all worshiped idols that could not help them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">"So, once more I will state my case against you," says the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. "I will also state it against your children and grandchildren.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">"Do so because my people have committed a double wrong: they have rejected me, the fountain of life-giving water, and they have dug cisterns for themselves, cracked cisterns which cannot even hold water."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">"Israel is not a slave, is he? He was not born into slavery, was he? If not, why then is he being carried off?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">"Indeed, long ago you threw off my authority and refused to be subject to me. You said, 'I will not serve you.' Instead, you gave yourself to other gods on every high hill and under every green tree, like a prostitute sprawls out before her lovers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">You are like a wild female donkey brought up in the wilderness. In her lust she sniffs the wind to get the scent of a male. No one can hold her back when she is in heat.

      <VERS vnumber="25">Do not chase after other gods until your shoes wear out and your throats become dry. But you say, 'It is useless for you to try and stop me because I love those foreign gods and want to pursue them!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Just as a thief has to suffer dishonor when he is caught, so the people of Israel will suffer dishonor for what they have done. So will their kings and officials, their priests and their prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They say to a wooden idol, 'You are my father.' They say to a stone image, 'You gave birth to me.' Yes, they have turned away from me instead of turning to me. Yet when they are in trouble, they say, 'Come and save us!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But where are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them save you when you are in trouble. The sad fact is that you have as many gods as you have towns, Judah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">"It did no good for me to punish your people. They did not respond to such correction. You slaughtered your prophets like a voracious lion."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">"If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him and becomes another man's wife, he may not take her back again. Doing that would utterly defile the land.

      <VERS vnumber="2">"Look up at the hilltops and consider this. You have had sex with other gods on every one of them. You waited for those gods like a thief lying in wait in the desert. You defiled the land by your wicked prostitution to other gods.</VERS>

Even after her unfaithful sister Judah had seen this, she still was not afraid, and she too went and gave herself like a prostitute to other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Because she took her prostitution so lightly, she defiled the land through her adulterous worship of gods made of wood and stone.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to Jeremiah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Hear the terms of the covenant I made with Israel and pass them on to the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Tell them that the Lord, the God of Israel, says, 'Anyone who does not keep the terms of the covenant will be under a curse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Those are the terms that I charged your ancestors to keep when I brought them out of Egypt, that place which was like an iron-smelting furnace. I said at that time, "Obey me and carry out the terms of the agreement exactly as I commanded you. If you do, you will be my people and I will be your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then I will keep the promise I swore on oath to your ancestors to give them a land flowing with milk and honey." That is the very land that you still live in today.'" And I responded, "Amen! Let it be so, <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to me, "Announce all the following words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: 'Listen to the terms of my covenant with you and carry them out!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For I solemnly warned your ancestors to obey me. I warned them again and again, ever since I delivered them out of Egypt until this very day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But they did not listen to me or pay any attention to me! Each one of them followed the stubborn inclinations of his own wicked heart. So I brought on them all the punishments threatened in the covenant because they did not carry out its terms as I commanded them to do.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to me, "The people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem have plotted rebellion against me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They have gone back to the evil ways of their ancestors of old who refused to obey what I told them. They, too, have paid allegiance to other gods and worshiped them. Both the nation of Israel and the nation of Judah have violated the covenant I made with their ancestors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, say this: 'I will soon bring disaster on them which they will not be able to escape! When they cry out to me for help, I will not listen to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then those living in the towns of Judah and in Jerusalem will go and cry out for help to the gods to whom they have been sacrificing. However, those gods will by no means be able to save them when disaster strikes them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">This is in spite of the fact that the people of Judah have as many gods as they have towns and the citizens of Jerusalem have set up as many altars to sacrifice to that disgusting god, Baal, as they have streets in the city!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So, Jeremiah, do not pray for these people. Do not cry out to me or petition me on their behalf. Do not plead with me to save them. For I will not listen to them when they call out to me for help when disaster strikes them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says to the people of Judah, "What right do you have to be in my temple, my beloved people? Many of you have done wicked things.

      <VERS vnumber="16">I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, once called you a thriving olive tree, one that produced beautiful fruit. But I will set you on fire, fire that will blaze with a mighty roar. Then all your branches will be good for nothing.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> gave me knowledge, that I might have understanding. Then he showed me what the people were doing.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Say: 'Listen, O king of Judah who follows in David's succession. You, your officials, and your subjects who pass through the gates of this palace must listen to what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, "Do what is just and right. Deliver those who have been robbed from those who oppress them. Do not exploit or mistreat foreigners who live in your land, children who have no fathers, or widows. Do not kill innocent people in this land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If you are careful to obey these commands, then the kings who follow in David's succession and ride in chariots or on horses will continue to come through the gates of this palace, as will their officials and their subjects.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But, if you do not obey these commands, I solemnly swear that this palace will become a pile of rubble. I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, affirm it!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"'For the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says concerning the palace of the king of Judah, "This place looks like a veritable forest of Gilead to me. It is like the wooded heights of Lebanon in my eyes. But I swear that I will make it like a wilderness whose towns have all been deserted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I will send men against it to destroy it with their axes and hatchets. They will hack up its fine cedar panels and columns and throw them into the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"'People from other nations will pass by this city. They will ask one another, "Why has the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> done such a thing to this great city?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The answer will come back, "It is because they broke their covenant with the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> their God and worshiped and served other gods."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"'Do not weep for the king who was killed. Do not grieve for him. But weep mournfully for the king who has gone into exile. For he will never return to see his native land again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"'For the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has spoken about Shallum son of Josiah, who succeeded his father as king of Judah but was carried off into exile. He has said, "He will never return to this land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For he will die in the country where they took him as a captive. He will never see this land again."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"'Sure to be judged is the king who builds his palace using injustice and treats people unfairly while adding its upper rooms. He makes his countrymen work for him for nothing. He does not pay them for their labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He says, "I will build myself a large palace with spacious upper rooms." He cuts windows in its walls, panels it with cedar, and paints its rooms red.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Does it make you any more of a king that you outstrip everyone else in building with cedar? Just think about your father. He was content that he had food and drink. He did what was just and right. So things went well with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He upheld the cause of the poor and needy. So things went well for Judah.' The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'That is a good example of what it means to know me.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But you are always thinking and looking for ways to increase your wealth by dishonest means. Your eyes and your heart are set on killing some innocent person and committing fraud and oppression.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has this to say about Josiah's son, King Jehoiakim of Judah: People will not mourn for him, saying, "This makes me sad, my brother! This makes me sad, my sister!" They will not mourn for him, saying, "Poor, poor lord! Poor, poor majesty!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He will be left unburied just like a dead donkey. His body will be dragged off and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">People of Jerusalem, go up to Lebanon and cry out in mourning. Go to the land of Bashan and cry out loudly. Cry out in mourning from the mountains of Moab. For your allies have all been defeated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">While you were feeling secure I gave you warning. But you said, "I refuse to listen to you." That is the way you have acted from your earliest history onward. Indeed, you have never paid attention to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">My judgment will carry off all your leaders like a storm wind! Your allies will go into captivity. Then you will certainly be disgraced and put to shame because of all the wickedness you have done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">You may feel as secure as a bird nesting in the cedars of Lebanon. But oh how you will groan when the pains of judgment come on you. They will be like those of a woman giving birth to a baby.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, "As surely as I am the living God, you, Jeconiah, king of Judah, son of Jehoiakim, will not be the earthly representative of my authority. Indeed, I will take that right away from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I will hand you over to those who want to take your life and of whom you are afraid. I will hand you over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his Babylonian soldiers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I will force you and your mother who gave you birth into exile. You will be exiled to a country where neither of you were born, and you will both die there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">You will never come back to this land to which you will long to return!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">This man, Jeconiah, will be like a broken pot someone threw away. He will be like a clay vessel that no one wants. Why will he and his children be forced into exile? Why will they be thrown out into a country they know nothing about?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">O land of Judah, land of Judah, land of Judah! Listen to what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has to say!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The LORD says,"Enroll this man in the register as though he were childless. Enroll him as a man who will not enjoy success during his lifetime. For none of his sons will succeed in occupying the throne of David or ever succeed in ruling over Judah."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, "The leaders of my people are sure to be judged. They were supposed to watch over my people like shepherds watch over their sheep. But they are causing my people to be destroyed and scattered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel has this to say about the leaders who are ruling over his people: "You have caused my people to be dispersed and driven into exile. You have not taken care of them. So I will punish you for the evil that you have done. I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, affirm it!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then I myself will regather those of my people who are still alive from all the countries where I have driven them. I will bring them back to their homeland. They will greatly increase in number.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I will install rulers over them who will care for them. Then they will no longer need to fear or be terrified. None of them will turn up missing. I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, promise it!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, promise that a new time will certainly come when I will raise up for them a righteous branch, a descendant of David. He will rule over them with wisdom and understanding and will do what is just and right in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Under his rule Judah will enjoy safety and Israel will live in security. This is the name he will go by: 'The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has provided us with justice.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"So I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, say: 'A new time will certainly come. People now affirm their oaths with "I swear as surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives who delivered the people of Israel out of Egypt."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But at that time they will affirm them with "I swear as surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives who delivered the descendants of the former nation of Israel from the land of the north and from all the other lands where he had banished them." At that time they will live in their own land.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Here is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says concerning the false prophets: My heart and my mind are deeply disturbed. I tremble all over. I am like a drunk person, like a person who has had too much wine, because of the way the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>and his holy word are being mistreated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the land is full of people unfaithful to him. They live wicked lives and they misuse their power. So the land is dried up because it is under his curse. The pastures in the wilderness are withered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moreover, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, "Both the prophets and priests are godless. I have even found them doing evil in my temple!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the paths they follow will be dark and slippery. They will stumble and fall headlong. For I will bring disaster on them. A day of reckoning is coming for them." The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> affirms it!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, "I saw the prophets of Samaria doing something that was disgusting. They prophesied in the name of the god Baal and led my people Israel astray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But I see the prophets of Jerusalem doing something just as shocking. They are unfaithful to me and continually prophesy lies. So they give encouragement to people who are doing evil, with the result that they do not stop their evildoing. I consider all of them as bad as the people of Sodom, and the citizens of Jerusalem as bad as the people of Gomorrah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So then I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who rules over all, have something to say concerning the prophets of Jerusalem: 'I will make these prophets eat the bitter food of suffering and drink the poison water of judgment. For the prophets of Jerusalem are the reason that ungodliness has spread throughout the land.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who rules over all says to the people of Jerusalem: "Do not listen to what those prophets are saying to you. They are filling you with false hopes. They are reporting visions of their own imaginations, not something the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has given them to say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They continually say to those who reject what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has said, 'Things will go well for you!' They say to all those who follow the stubborn inclinations of their own hearts, 'Nothing bad will happen to you!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yet which of them has ever stood in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s inner circle so they could see and hear what he has to say? Which of them have ever paid attention or listened to what he has said?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But just watch! The wrath of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>will come like a storm! Like a raging storm it will rage down on the heads of those who are wicked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The anger of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will not turn back until he has fully carried out his intended purposes. In days to come you people will come to understand this clearly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I did not send those prophets. Yet they were in a hurry to give their message. I did not tell them anything. Yet they prophesied anyway.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But if they had stood in my inner circle, they would have proclaimed my message to my people. They would have caused my people to turn from their wicked ways and stop doing the evil things they are doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Do you people think that I am some local deity and not the transcendent God?" the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> asks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">"Do you really think anyone can hide himself where I cannot see him?" the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> asks. "Do you not know that I am everywhere?" the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> asks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, "I have heard what those prophets who are prophesying lies in my name are saying. They are saying, 'I have had a dream! I have had a dream!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Those prophets are just prophesying lies. They are prophesying the delusions of their own minds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">How long will they go on plotting to make my people forget who I am through the dreams they tell one another? That is just as bad as what their ancestors did when they forgot who I am by worshiping the god Baal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Let the prophet who has had a dream go ahead and tell his dream. Let the person who has received my message report that message faithfully. What is like straw cannot compare to what is like grain! I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, affirm it!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">My message is like a fire that purges dross! It is like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces! I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, so affirm it!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, affirm that I am opposed to those prophets who steal messages from one another that they claim are from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I, the Lord, affirm that I am opposed to those prophets who are using their own tongues to declare, 'The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> declares....'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, affirm that I am opposed to those prophets who dream up lies and report them. They are misleading my people with their reckless lies. I did not send them. I did not commission them. They are not helping these people at all. I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, affirm it!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to me, "Jeremiah, when one of these people, or a prophet, or a priest asks you, 'What burdensome message do you have from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>?' Tell them, 'You are the burden, and I will cast you away. I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, affirm it!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">I will punish any prophet, priest, or other person who says "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s message is burdensome." I will punish both that person and his whole family.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So I, Jeremiah, tell you, "Each of you people should say to his friend or his relative, 'How did the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> answer? Or what did the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> say?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">You must no longer say that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s message is burdensome. For what is 'burdensome' really pertains to what a person himself says. You are misrepresenting the words of our God, the living God, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who rules over all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Each of you should merely ask the prophet, 'What answer did the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> give you? Or what did the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> say?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But just suppose you continue to say, 'The message of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is burdensome.' Here is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says will happen: 'I sent word to you that you must not say, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s message is burdensome." But you used the words "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s message is burdensome" anyway.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">So I will carry you far off and throw you away. I will send both you and the city I gave to you and to your ancestors out of my sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">I will bring on you lasting shame and lasting disgrace which will never be forgotten!'"</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> showed me two baskets of figs sitting before his temple. This happened after King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon deported Jehoiakim's son, King Jeconiah of Judah. He deported him and the leaders of Judah, along with the craftsmen and metal workers, and took them to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">One basket had very good-looking figs in it. They looked like those that had ripened early. The other basket had very bad-looking figs in it, so bad they could not be eaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said to me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" I answered, "I see figs. The good ones look very good. But the bad ones look very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten."</VERS>

I consider them to be just like those bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I will bring such disaster on them that all the kingdoms of the earth will be horrified. I will make them an object of reproach, a proverbial example of disaster. I will make them an object of ridicule, an example to be used in curses. That is how they will be remembered wherever I banish them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah. (That was the same as the first year that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the people who were living in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"For the last twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon was ruling in Judah until now, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has been speaking to me. I told you over and over again what he said. But you would not listen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Over and over again the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has sent his servants the prophets to you. But you have not listened or paid attention.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He said through them, 'Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and stop doing the evil things you are doing. If you do, I will allow you to continue to live here in the land that I gave to you and your ancestors as a lasting possession.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">If you do not obey me, then I will do to this temple what I did to Shiloh. And I will make this city an example to be used in curses by people from all the nations on the earth.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah say these things in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jeremiah had just barely finished saying all the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had commanded him to say to all the people. All at once some of the priests, the prophets, and the people grabbed him and shouted, "You deserve to die!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">How dare you claim the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s authority to prophesy such things! How dare you claim his authority to prophesy that this temple will become like Shiloh and that this city will become an uninhabited ruin!" Then all the people crowded around Jeremiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">However, some of the officials of Judah heard about what was happening and they rushed up to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple from the royal palace. They set up court at the entrance of the New Gate of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the priests and the prophets made their charges before the officials and all the people. They said, "This man should be condemned to die because he prophesied against this city. You have heard him do so with your own ears."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Jeremiah made his defense before all the officials and all the people. "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> sent me to prophesy everything you have heard me say against this temple and against this city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But correct the way you have been living and do what is right. Obey the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God. If you do, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> will forgo destroying you as he threatened he would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As to my case, I am in your power. Do to me what you deem fair and proper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But you should take careful note of this: If you put me to death, you will bring on yourselves and this city and those who live in it the guilt of murdering an innocent man. For the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has sent me to speak all this where you can hear it. That is the truth!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the officials and all the people rendered their verdict to the priests and the prophets. They said, "This man should not be condemned to die. For he has spoken to us under the authority of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then some of the elders of Judah stepped forward and spoke to all the people gathered there. They said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">"Micah from Moresheth prophesied during the time Hezekiah was king of Judah. He told all the people of Judah,'The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who rules over all says, "Zion will become a plowed field. Jerusalem will become a pile of rubble. The temple mount will become a mere wooded ridge."'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">King Hezekiah and all the people of Judah did not put him to death, did they? Did not Hezekiah show reverence for the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and seek the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s favor? Did not the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> forgo destroying them as he threatened he would? But we are on the verge of bringing great disaster on ourselves."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now there was another man who prophesied as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s representative against this city and this land just as Jeremiah did. His name was Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When the king and all his bodyguards and officials heard what he was prophesying, the king sought to have him executed. But Uriah found out about it and fled to Egypt out of fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">However, King Jehoiakim sent some men to Egypt, including Elnathan son of Achbor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and they brought Uriah back from there. They took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him executed and had his body thrown into the burial place of the common people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">However, Ahikam son of Shaphan used his influence to keep Jeremiah from being handed over and executed by the people.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">

      <VERS vnumber="4">Charge them to give their masters a message from me. Tell them, 'The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel who rules over all says to give your masters this message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"I made the earth and the people and animals on it by my mighty power and great strength, and I give it to whomever I see fit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">I told King Zedekiah of Judah the same thing. I said, "Submit to the yoke of servitude to the king of Babylon. Be subject to him and his people. Then you will continue to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There is no reason why you and your people should die in war or from starvation or disease! That's what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says will happen to any nation that will not be subject to the king of Babylon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Do not listen to them. Be subject to the king of Babylon. Then you will continue to live. Why should this city be made a pile of rubble?'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I also told them, "If they are really prophets and the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> is speaking to them, let them pray earnestly to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who rules over all.

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The following events occurred in that same year, early in the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah. To be more precise, it was the fifth month of the fourth year of his reign. The prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, spoke to Jeremiah in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple in the presence of the priests and all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel who rules over all says, 'I will break the yoke of servitude to the king of Babylon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the prophet Jeremiah responded to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The prophet Jeremiah said, "Amen! May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> do all this! May the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> make your prophecy come true! May he bring back to this place from Babylon all the valuable articles taken from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple and the people who were carried into exile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But listen to what I say to you and to all these people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">From earliest times, the prophets who preceded you and me invariably prophesied war, disaster, and plagues against many countries and great kingdoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So if a prophet prophesied peace and prosperity, it was only known that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> truly sent him when what he prophesied came true."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The prophet Hananiah then took the yoke off the prophet Jeremiah's neck and broke it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then he spoke up in the presence of all the people. "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'In the same way I will break the yoke of servitude of all the nations to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon  before two years are over.'" After he heard this, the prophet Jeremiah departed and went on his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But shortly after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to Jeremiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">"Go and tell Hananiah that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'You have indeed broken the wooden yoke. But you have only succeeded in replacing it with an iron one!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the prophet Jeremiah told the prophet Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah! The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> did not send you! You are making these people trust in a lie!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'I will most assuredly remove you from the face of the earth. You will die this very year because you have counseled rebellion against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.'"</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="32">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the tenth year that Zedekiah was ruling over Judah the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to Jeremiah. That was the same as the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now at that time, the armies of the king of Babylon were besieging Jerusalem. The prophet Jeremiah was confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse attached to the royal palace of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For King Zedekiah had confined Jeremiah there after he had reproved him for prophesying as he did. He had asked Jeremiah, "Why do you keep prophesying these things? Why do you keep saying that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'I will hand this city over to the king of Babylon? I will let him capture it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">King Zedekiah of Judah will not escape from the Babylonians. He will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon. He must answer personally to the king of Babylon and confront him face to face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Zedekiah will be carried off to Babylon and will remain there until I have fully dealt with him. I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, affirm it! Even if you continue to fight against the Babylonians, you cannot win.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So now, Jeremiah said, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> told me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">'Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, will come to you soon. He will say to you, "Buy my field at Anathoth because you are entitled as my closest relative to buy it."'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now it happened just as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had said! My cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guardhouse. He said to me, 'Buy my field which is at Anathoth in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. Buy it for yourself since you are entitled as my closest relative to take possession of it for yourself.' When this happened, I recognized that the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had indeed spoken to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel. I weighed out seven ounces of silver and gave it to him to pay for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I signed the deed of purchase, sealed it, and had some men serve as witnesses to the purchase. I weighed out the silver for him on a scale.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There were two copies of the deed of purchase. One was sealed and contained the order of transfer and the conditions of purchase. The other was left unsealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I took both copies of the deed of purchase and gave them to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah. I gave them to him in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, the witnesses who had signed the deed of purchase, and all the Judeans who were housed in the courtyard of the guardhouse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In the presence of all these people I instructed Baruch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">'The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel who rules over all says, "Take these documents, both the sealed copy of the deed of purchase and the unsealed copy. Put them in a clay jar so that they may be preserved for a long time to come."'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">'Oh, Lord God, you did indeed make heaven and earth by your mighty power and great strength. Nothing is too hard for you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">You show unfailing love to thousands. But you also punish children for the sins of their parents. You are the great and powerful God who is known as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who rules over all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You plan great things and you do mighty deeds. You see everything people do. You reward each of them for the way they live and for the things they do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You did miracles and amazing deeds in the land of Egypt which have had lasting effect. By this means you gained both in Israel and among humankind a renown that lasts to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You used your mighty power and your great strength to perform miracles and amazing deeds and to bring great terror on the Egyptians. By this means you brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You kept the promise that you swore on oath to their ancestors. You gave them a land flowing with milk and honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But when they came in and took possession of it, they did not obey you or live as you had instructed them. They did not do anything that you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Even now siege ramps have been built up around the city in order to capture it. War, starvation, and disease are sure to make the city fall into the hands of the Babylonians who are attacking it. <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, you threatened that this would happen. Now you can see that it is already taking place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The city is sure to fall into the hands of the Babylonians. Yet, in spite of this, you, Lord God, have said to me, "Buy that field with silver and have the transaction legally witnessed."'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> answered Jeremiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">"I am the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, the God of all humankind. There is, indeed, nothing too difficult for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, say: 'I will indeed hand this city over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and the Babylonian army. They will capture it.</VERS>

They will burn it down along with the houses where people have made me angry by offering sacrifices to the god Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods on their rooftops.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This will happen because the people of Israel and Judah have repeatedly done what displeases me from their earliest history until now and because they have repeatedly made me angry by the things they have done. I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, affirm it!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">This will happen because the people of this city have aroused my anger and my wrath since the time they built it until now. They have made me so angry that I am determined to remove it from my sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I am determined to do so because the people of Israel and Judah have made me angry with all their wickedness - they, their kings, their officials, their priests, their prophets, and especially the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem have done this wickedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They have turned away from me instead of turning to me. I tried over and over again to instruct them, but they did not listen and respond to correction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They set up their disgusting idols in the temple which I have claimed for my own and defiled it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">They built places of worship for the god Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom so that they could sacrifice their sons and daughters to the god Molech. Such a disgusting practice was not something I commanded them to do! It never even entered my mind to command them to do such a thing! So Judah is certainly liable for punishment.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">"You and your people are right in saying, 'War, starvation, and disease are sure to make this city fall into the hands of the king of Babylon.' But now I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel, have something further to say about this city:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">'I will certainly regather my people from all the countries where I will have exiled them in my anger, fury, and great wrath. I will bring them back to this place and allow them to live here in safety.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel told Jeremiah to go and give King Zedekiah of Judah a message.

      <VERS vnumber="2">"Go to the Rechabite community. Invite them to come into one of the side rooms of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple and offer them some wine to drink."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So I went and got Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah the grandson of Habazziniah, his brothers, all his sons, and all the rest of the Rechabite community.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I took them to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple. I took them into the room where the disciples of the prophet Hanan son of Igdaliah stayed. That room was next to the one where the temple officers stayed and above the room where Maaseiah son of Shallum, one of the doorkeepers of the temple, stayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then I set cups and pitchers full of wine in front of the members of the Rechabite community and said to them, "Have some wine."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But they answered, "We do not drink wine because our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us not to. He told us, 'You and your children must never drink wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Do not build houses. Do not plant crops. Do not plant a vineyard or own one. Live in tents all your lives. If you do these things you will live a long time in the land that you wander about on.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We and our wives and our sons and daughters have obeyed everything our ancestor Jonadab commanded us. We have never drunk wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">We have not built any houses to live in. We do not own any vineyards, fields, or crops.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">We have lived in tents. We have obeyed our ancestor Jonadab and done exactly as he commanded us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon invaded the land we said, 'Let's get up and go to Jerusalem to get away from the Babylonian and Aramean armies.' That is why we are staying here in Jerusalem."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to Jeremiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel who rules over all told him, "Go and speak to the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem. Tell them, 'I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, say: "You must learn a lesson from this about obeying what I say!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jonadab son of Rechab ordered his descendants not to drink wine. His orders have been carried out. To this day his descendants have drunk no wine because they have obeyed what their ancestor commanded them. But I have spoken to you over and over again, but you have not obeyed me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I sent all my servants the prophets to warn you over and over again. They said, "Every one of you, stop doing the evil things you have been doing and do what is right. Do not pay allegiance to other gods and worship them. Then you can continue to live in this land that I gave to you and your ancestors." But you did not pay any attention or listen to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yes, the descendants of Jonadab son of Rechab have carried out the orders that their ancestor gave them. But you people have not obeyed me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So I, the Lord, the God who rules over all, the God of Israel, say: "I will soon bring on Judah and all the citizens of Jerusalem all the disaster that I threatened to bring on them. I will do this because I spoke to them but they did not listen. I called out to them but they did not answer."'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Jeremiah spoke to the Rechabite community, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel who rules over all says, 'You have obeyed the orders of your ancestor Jonadab. You have followed all his instructions. You have done exactly as he commanded you.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So the LORD God of Israel who rules over all says, 'Jonadab son of Rechab will never lack a male descendant to serve me.'"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="36">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to Jeremiah in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"Get a scroll. Write on it everything I have told you to say about Israel, Judah, and all the other nations since I began to speak to you in the reign of Josiah until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about all the disaster I intend to bring on them, they will all stop doing the evil things they have been doing. If they do, I will forgive their sins and the wicked things they have done."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So Jeremiah summoned Baruch son of Neriah. Then Jeremiah dictated to Baruch everything the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had told him to say and Baruch wrote it all down in a scroll.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jeremiah told Baruch, "I am no longer allowed to go into the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So you go there the next time all the people of Judah come in from their towns to fast in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple. Read out loud where all of them can hear you what I told you the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said, which you wrote in the scroll.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Perhaps then they will ask the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> for mercy and will all stop doing the evil things they have been doing. For the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has threatened to bring great anger and wrath against these people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Baruch son of Neriah did exactly what the prophet Jeremiah had told him to do. He read what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had said from the scroll in the temple of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All the people living in Jerusalem and all the people who came into Jerusalem from the towns of Judah came to observe a fast before the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. The fast took place in the ninth month of the fifth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">At that time Baruch went into the temple of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. He stood in the entrance of the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan who had been the royal secretary. That room was in the upper court near the entrance of the New Gate. There, where all the people could hear him, he read from the scroll what Jeremiah had said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Micaiah, who was the son of Gemariah and the grandson of Shaphan, heard Baruch read from the scroll everything the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He went down to the chamber of the royal secretary in the king's palace and found all the court officials in session there. Elishama the royal secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials were seated there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">All the officials sent Jehudi, who was the son of Nethaniah and the grandson of Cushi, to Baruch. They ordered him to tell Baruch, "Come here and bring with you the scroll you read in the hearing of the people." So Baruch son of Neriah went to them, carrying the scroll in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They said to him, "Please sit down and read it to us." So Baruch sat down and read it to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When they had heard it all, they expressed their alarm to one another. Then they said to Baruch, "We must certainly give the king a report about everything you have read!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then they asked Baruch, "How did you come to write all these words? Do they actually come from Jeremiah's mouth?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Baruch answered, "Yes, they came from his own mouth. He dictated all these words to me and I wrote them down in ink on this scroll."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the officials said to Baruch, "You and Jeremiah must go and hide. You must not let anyone know where you are."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The officials put the scroll in the room of Elishama, the royal secretary, for safekeeping. Then they went to the court and reported everything to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. He went and got it from the room of Elishama, the royal secretary. Then he himself read it to the king and all the officials who were standing around him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Since it was the ninth month of the year, the king was sitting in his winter quarters. A fire was burning in the firepot in front of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As soon as Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king would cut them off with a penknife and throw them on the fire in the firepot. He kept doing so until the whole scroll was burned up in the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Neither he nor any of his attendants showed any alarm when they heard all that had been read. Nor did they tear their clothes to show any grief or sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The king did not even listen to Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah, who had urged him not to burn the scroll.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He also ordered Jerahmeel, who was one of the royal princes, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest the scribe Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah. However, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> hid them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to Jeremiah after Jehoiakim had burned the scroll containing what Jeremiah had spoken and Baruch had written down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">"Get another scroll and write on it everything that was written on the original scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Tell King Jehoiakim of Judah, 'The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, "You burned the scroll. You asked Jeremiah, 'How dare you write in this scroll that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land and wipe out all the people and animals on it?'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says concerning King Jehoiakim of Judah, "None of his line will occupy the throne of David. His dead body will be thrown out to be exposed to scorching heat by day and frost by night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I will punish him and his descendants and the officials who serve him for the wicked things they have done. I will bring on them, the citizens of Jerusalem, and the people of Judah all the disaster that I threatened to do to them. I will punish them because I threatened them but they still paid no heed."'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then Jeremiah got another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah. As Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on this scroll everything that had been on the scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah burned in the fire. They also added on this scroll several other messages of the same kind.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="37">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Zedekiah son of Josiah succeeded Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim as king. He was elevated to the throne of the land of Judah by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Neither he nor the officials who served him nor the people of Judah paid any attention to what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> said through the prophet Jeremiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to the prophet Jeremiah. He told them to say, "Please pray to the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> our God on our behalf."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">(Now Jeremiah had not yet been put in prison. So he was still free to come and go among the people as he pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">At that time the Babylonian forces had temporarily given up their siege against Jerusalem. They had had it under siege, but withdrew when they heard that the army of Pharaoh had set out from Egypt.  )</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> gave the prophet Jeremiah a message for them. He told him to tell them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel says, 'Give a message to the king of Judah who sent you to ask me to help him. Tell him, "The army of Pharaoh that was on its way to help you will go back home to Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the Babylonian forces will return. They will attack the city and will capture it and burn it down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Moreover, I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, warn you not to deceive yourselves into thinking that the Babylonian forces will go away and leave you alone. For they will not go away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For even if you were to defeat all the Babylonian forces fighting against you so badly that only wounded men were left lying in their tents, they would get up and burn this city down."'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The following events also occurred while the Babylonian forces had temporarily withdrawn from Jerusalem because the army of Pharaoh was coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jeremiah started to leave Jerusalem to go to the territory of Benjamin. He wanted to make sure he got his share of the property that was being divided up among his family there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he only got as far as the Benjamin Gate. There an officer in charge of the guards named Irijah, who was the son of Shelemiah and the grandson of Hananiah, stopped him. He seized Jeremiah and said, "You are deserting to the Babylonians!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Jeremiah answered, "That's a lie! I am not deserting to the Babylonians." But Irijah would not listen to him. Irijah put Jeremiah under arrest and took him to the officials.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The officials were very angry at Jeremiah. They had him flogged and put in prison in the house of Jonathan, the royal secretary, which they had converted into a place for confining prisoners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Jeremiah was put in prison in a cell in the dungeon in Jonathan's house. He was kept there for a long time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then King Zedekiah had him brought to the palace. There he questioned him privately and asked him, "Is there any message from the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>?" Jeremiah answered, "Yes, there is." Then he announced, "You will be handed over to the king of Babylon."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah, "What crime have I committed against you, or the officials who serve you, or the people of Judah? What have I done to make you people throw me into prison?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Where now are the prophets who prophesied to you that the king of Babylon would not attack you or this land?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But now please listen, your royal Majesty, and grant my plea for mercy. Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan, the royal secretary. If you do, I will die there."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then King Zedekiah ordered that Jeremiah be committed to the courtyard of the guardhouse. He also ordered that a loaf of bread be given to him every day from the baker's street until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah was kept in the courtyard of the guardhouse.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="38">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah had heard the things that Jeremiah had been telling the people. They had heard him say,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'Those who stay in this city will die in battle or of starvation or disease. Those who leave the city and surrender to the Babylonians will live. They will escape with their lives.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They had also heard him say, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon. They will capture it.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So these officials said to the king, "This man must be put to death. For he is demoralizing the soldiers who are left in the city as well as all the other people there by these things he is saying. This man is not seeking to help these people but is trying to harm them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">King Zedekiah said to them, "Very well, you can do what you want with him. For I cannot do anything to stop you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the officials took Jeremiah and put him in the cistern of Malkijah, one of the royal princes, that was in the courtyard of the guardhouse. There was no water in the cistern, only mud. So when they lowered Jeremiah into the cistern with ropes he sank in the mud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">An Ethiopian, Ebed Melech, a court official in the royal palace, heard that Jeremiah had been put in the cistern. While the king was holding court at the Benjamin Gate,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Ebed Melech departed the palace and went to speak to the king. He said to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">"Your royal Majesty, those men have been very wicked in all that they have done to the prophet Jeremiah. They have thrown him into a cistern and he is sure to die of starvation there because there is no food left in the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the king gave Ebed Melech the Ethiopian the following order: "Take thirty men with you from here and go pull the prophet Jeremiah out of the cistern before he dies."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So Ebed Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasure room in the palace. He got some worn-out clothes and old rags from there and let them down by ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Ebed Melech called down to Jeremiah, "Put these rags and worn-out clothes under your armpits to pad the ropes. Jeremiah did as Ebed Melech instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they pulled Jeremiah up from the cistern with ropes. Jeremiah, however, still remained confined to the courtyard of the guardhouse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Some time later Zedekiah sent and had Jeremiah brought to him at the third entrance of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple. The king said to Jeremiah, "I would like to ask you a question. Do not hide anything from me when you answer."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I answer you, you will certainly kill me. If I give you advice, you will not listen to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So King Zedekiah made a secret promise to Jeremiah and sealed it with an oath. He promised, "As surely as the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> lives who has given us life and breath, I promise you this: I will not kill you or hand you over to those men who want to kill you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, the God who rules over all, the God of Israel, says, 'You must surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon. If you do, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down. Indeed, you and your whole family will be spared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Babylonians and they will burn it down. You yourself will not escape from them.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Babylonians. The Babylonians might hand me over to them and they will torture me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Jeremiah answered, "You will not be handed over to them. Please obey the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> by doing what I have been telling you. Then all will go well with you and your life will be spared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But if you refuse to surrender, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has shown me a vision of what will happen. Here is what I saw:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All the women who are left in the royal palace of Judah will be led out to the officers of the king of Babylon. They will taunt you saying, 'Your trusted friends misled you; they have gotten the best of you. Now that your feet are stuck in the mud, they have turned their backs on you.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">"All your wives and your children will be turned over to the Babylonians. You yourself will not escape from them but will be captured by the king of Babylon. This city will be burned down."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Zedekiah told Jeremiah, "Do not let anyone know about the conversation we have had. If you do, you will die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The officials may hear that I have talked with you. They may come to you and say, 'Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you. Do not hide anything from us. If you do, we will kill you.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If they do this, tell them, 'I was pleading with the king not to send me back to die in the dungeon of Jonathan's house.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">All the officials did indeed come and question Jeremiah. He told them exactly what the king had instructed him to say. They stopped questioning him any further because no one had actually heard their conversation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Jeremiah remained confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse until the day Jerusalem was captured.The following events occurred when Jerusalem was captured.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="39">
      <VERS vnumber="1">King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it. The siege began in the tenth month of the ninth year that Zedekiah ruled over Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It lasted until the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah's eleventh year. On that day they broke through the city walls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim, who was a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer, who was a high official, and all the other officers of the king of Babylon came and set up quarters in the Middle Gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When King Zedekiah of Judah and all his soldiers saw them, they tried to escape. They departed from the city during the night. They took a path through the king's garden and passed out through the gate between the two walls. Then they headed for the Jordan Valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the Babylonian army chased after them. They caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho and captured him. They took him to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon at Riblah in the territory of Hamath and Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There at Riblah the king of Babylon had Zedekiah's sons put to death while Zedekiah was forced to watch. The king of Babylon also had all the nobles of Judah put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then he had Zedekiah's eyes put out and had him bound in chains to be led off to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Babylonians burned down the royal palace, the temple of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, and the people's homes, and they tore down the wall of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, took captive the rest of the people who were left in the city. He carried them off to Babylon along with the people who had deserted to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But he left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing. He gave them fields and vineyards at that time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had issued orders concerning Jeremiah. He had passed them on through Nebuzaradan, the captain of his royal guard,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"Find Jeremiah and look out for him. Do not do anything to harm him, but do with him whatever he tells you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, Nebushazban, who was a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer, who was a high official, and all the other officers of the king of Babylon</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">sent and had Jeremiah brought from the courtyard of the guardhouse. They turned him over to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and the grandson of Shaphan, to take him home with him. But Jeremiah stayed among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> had spoken to Jeremiah while he was still confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"Go and tell Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, 'The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel who rules over all says, "I will carry out against this city what I promised. It will mean disaster and not good fortune for it. When that disaster happens, you will be there to see it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But I will rescue you when it happens. I, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, affirm it! You will not be handed over to those whom you fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I will certainly save you. You will not fall victim to violence. You will escape with your life because you trust in me. I, the LORD, affirm it!"'"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="40">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to Jeremiah after Nebuzaradan the captain of the royal guard had set him free at Ramah. He had taken him there in chains along with all the people from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried off to exile to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The captain of the royal guard took Jeremiah aside and said to him, "The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> your God threatened this place with this disaster.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now he has brought it about. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has done just as he threatened to do. This disaster has happened because you people sinned against the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> and did not obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But now, Jeremiah, today I will set you free from the chains on your wrists. If you would like to come to Babylon with me, come along and I will take care of you. But if you prefer not to come to Babylon with me, you are not required to do so. You are free to go anywhere in the land you want to go. Go wherever you choose."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Before Jeremiah could turn to leave, the captain of the guard added, "Go back to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed to govern the towns of Judah. Go back and live with him among the people. Or go wherever else you choose." Then the captain of the guard gave Jeremiah some food and a present and let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and lived there with him. He stayed there to live among the people who had been left in the land of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now some of the officers of the Judean army and their troops had been hiding in the countryside. They heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam to govern the country. They also heard that he had been put in charge over the men, women, and children from the poorer classes of the land who had not been carried off into exile in Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So all these officers and their troops came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. The officers who came were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, took an oath so as to give them and their troops some assurance of safety. "Do not be afraid to submit to the Babylonians. Settle down in the land and submit to the king of Babylon. Then things will go well for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I for my part will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians whenever they come to us. You for your part go ahead and harvest the wine, the dates, the figs, and the olive oil, and store them in jars. Go ahead and settle down in the towns that you have taken over."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">"The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel who rules over all says, 'You have seen all the disaster I brought on Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah. Indeed, they now lie in ruins and are deserted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">This happened because of the wickedness the people living there did. They made me angry by worshiping and offering sacrifice to other gods whom neither they nor you nor your ancestors previously knew.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">So my anger and my wrath were poured out and burned like a fire through the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. That is why they have become the desolate ruins that they are today.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"So now the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, the God who rules over all, the God of Israel, asks, 'Why will you do such great harm to yourselves? Why should every man, woman, child, and baby of yours be destroyed from the midst of Judah? Why should you leave yourselves without a remnant?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That is what will result from your making me angry by what you are doing. You are making me angry by sacrificing to other gods here in the land of Egypt where you live. You will be destroyed for doing that! You will become an example used in curses and an object of ridicule among all the nations of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Have you forgotten all the wicked things that have been done in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem by your ancestors, by the kings of Judah and their wives, by you and your wives?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">To this day your people have shown no contrition! They have not revered me nor followed the laws and statutes I commanded you and your ancestors.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"Because of this, the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> God of Israel who rules over all says, 'I am determined to bring disaster on you, even to the point of destroying all the Judeans here.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Then all the men who were aware that their wives were sacrificing to other gods, as well as all their wives, answered Jeremiah. There was a great crowd of them representing all the people who lived in northern and southern Egypt. They answered,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Instead we will do everything we vowed we would do.

      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Jeremiah replied to all the people, both men and women, who responded to him in this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">"The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> did indeed remember and call to mind what you did!

      <VERS vnumber="22">Finally the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> could no longer endure your wicked deeds and the disgusting things you did.

      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people, particularly to all the women. "Listen to what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has to say all you people of Judah who are in Egypt.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">But listen to what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> has to say, all you people of Judah who are living in the land of Egypt.

      <VERS vnumber="27">I will indeed see to it that disaster, not prosperity, happens to them. All the people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will die in war or from starvation until not one of them is left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Some who survive in battle will return to the land of Judah from the land of Egypt. But they will be very few indeed! Then the Judean remnant who have come to live in the land of Egypt will know whose word proves true, mine or theirs.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Moreover the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says, 'I will make something happen to prove that I will punish you in this place. I will do it so that you will know that my threats to bring disaster on you will prove true.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">(On the fifth day of the month - it was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">the word of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> came to the priest Ezekiel the son of Buzi, at the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. The hand of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> came on him there).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As I watched, I noticed a windstorm coming from the north - an enormous cloud, with lightning flashing, such that bright light rimmed it and came from it like glowing amber from the middle of a fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In the fire were what looked like four living beings. In their appearance they had human form,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but each had four faces and four wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Their legs were straight, but the soles of their feet were like calves' feet. They gleamed like polished bronze.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They had human hands under their wings on their four sides. As for the faces and wings of the four of them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">their wings touched each other; they did not turn as they moved, but went straight ahead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Their faces had this appearance: Each of the four had the face of a man, with the face of a lion on the right, the face of an ox on the left and also the face of an eagle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Their wings were spread out above them; each had two wings touching the wings of one of the other beings on either side and two wings covering their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Each moved straight ahead - wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In the middle of the living beings was something like burning coals of fire or like torches. It moved back and forth among the living beings. It was bright, and lightning was flashing out of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The living beings moved backward and forward as quickly as flashes of lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then I looked, and I saw one wheel on the ground beside each of the four beings.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">When they moved they would go in any of the four directions they faced without turning as they moved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Their rims were high and awesome, and the rims of all four wheels were full of eyes all around.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When the living beings moved, the wheels beside them moved; when the living beings rose up from the ground, the wheels rose up too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise up beside them because the spirit of the living being was in the wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When the living beings moved, the wheels moved, and when they stopped moving, the wheels stopped. When they rose up from the ground, the wheels rose up from the ground; the wheels rose up beside them because the spirit of the living being was in the wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Over the heads of the living beings was something like a platform, glittering awesomely like ice, stretched out over their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Under the platform their wings were stretched out, each toward the other. Each of the beings also had two wings covering its body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings - it was like the sound of rushing waters, or the voice of the Almighty, or the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then there was a voice from above the platform over their heads when they stood still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Above the platform over their heads was something like a sapphire shaped like a throne. High above on the throne was a form that appeared to be a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I saw an amber glow like a fire enclosed all around from his waist up. From his waist down I saw something that looked like fire. There was a brilliant light around it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds after the rain. This was the appearance of the surrounding brilliant light; it looked like the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I threw myself face down, and I heard a voice speaking.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">He said to me, "Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your belly with this scroll I am giving to you." So I ate it, and it was sweet like honey in my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He said to me, "Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak my words to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech and difficult language, but to the house of Israel -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">not to many peoples of unintelligible speech and difficult language, whose words you cannot understand - surely if I had sent you to them, they would listen to you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the house of Israel is unwilling to listen to you, because they are not willing to listen to me, for the whole house of Israel is hard-headed and hard-hearted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"I have made your face adamant to match their faces, and your forehead hard to match their foreheads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I have made your forehead harder than flint - like diamond! Do not fear them or be terrified of the looks they give you, for they are a rebellious house."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said to me, "Son of man, take all my words that I speak to you to heart and listen carefully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Go to the exiles, to your fellow countrymen, and speak to them - say to them, 'This is what the sovereign <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> says,' whether they pay attention or not."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then a wind lifted me up and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me as the glory of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> rose from its place,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and the sound of the living beings' wings brushing against each other, and the sound of the wheels alongside them, a great rumbling sound.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">A wind lifted me up and carried me away. I went bitterly, my spirit full of fury, and the hand of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> rested powerfully on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I came to the exiles at Tel Abib, who lived by the Kebar River. I sat dumbfounded among them there, where they were living, for seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">At the end of seven days the word of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> came to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">"Son of man, I have appointed you a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you must give them a warning from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When I say to the wicked, "You will certainly die," and you do not warn him - you do not speak out to warn the wicked to turn from his wicked deed and wicked lifestyle so that he may live - that wicked person will die for his iniquity, but I will hold you accountable for his death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But as for you, if you warn the wicked and he does not turn from his wicked deed and from his wicked lifestyle, he will die for his iniquity but you will have saved your own life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">"When a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I set an obstacle before him, he will die. If you have not warned him, he will die for his sin. The righteous deeds he performed will not be considered, but I will hold you accountable for his death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">However, if you warn the righteous person not to sin, and he does not sin, he will certainly live because he was warned, and you will have saved your own life."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The hand of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> rested on me there, and he said to me, "Get up, go out to the valley, and I will speak with you there."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So I got up and went out to the valley, and the glory of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> was standing there, just like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I threw myself face down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then a wind came into me and stood me on my feet. The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke to me and said, "Go shut yourself in your house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and tie you up with them, so you cannot go out among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to reprove them, for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when I speak with you, I will loosen your tongue and you must say to them, 'This is what the sovereign LORD says.' Those who listen will listen, but the indifferent will refuse, for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Oholah was the name of the older and Oholibah the name of her younger sister. They became mine, and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria and Oholibah is Jerusalem.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="27" bname="Daniel" bsname="Dan">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem and laid it under siege.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now the Lord delivered King Jehoiakim of Judah into his power, along with some of the vessels of the temple of God. He brought them to the land of Babylonia to the temple of his god and put the vessels in the treasury of his god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The king commanded Ashpenaz, who was in charge of his court officials, to choose some of the Israelites who were of royal and noble descent -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">young men in whom there was no physical defect and who were handsome, well versed in all kinds of wisdom, well educated and having keen insight, and who were capable of entering the king's royal service - and to teach them the literature and language of the Babylonians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So the king assigned them a daily ration from his royal delicacies and from the wine he himself drank. They were to be trained for the next three years. At the end of that time they were to enter the king's service.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As it turned out, among these young men were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the overseer of the court officials renamed them. He gave Daniel the name Belteshazzar, Hananiah he named Shadrach, Mishael he named Meshach, and Azariah he named Abednego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the royal delicacies or the royal wine. He therefore asked the overseer of the court officials for permission not to defile himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then God made the overseer of the court officials sympathetic to Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But he responded to Daniel, "I fear my master the king. He is the one who has decided your food and drink. What would happen if he saw that you looked malnourished in comparison to the other young men your age? If that happened, you would endanger my life with the king!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Daniel then spoke to the warden whom the overseer of the court officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"Please test your servants for ten days by providing us with some vegetables to eat and water to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who are eating the royal delicacies; deal with us in light of what you see."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So the warden agreed to their proposal and tested them for ten days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">At the end of the ten days their appearance was better and their bodies were healthier than all the young men who had been eating the royal delicacies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So the warden removed the delicacies and the wine from their diet and gave them a diet of vegetables instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now as for these four young men, God endowed them with knowledge and skill in all sorts of literature and wisdom - and Daniel had insight into all kinds of visions and dreams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When the time appointed by the king arrived, the overseer of the court officials brought them into Nebuchadnezzar's presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When the king spoke with them, he did not find among the entire group anyone like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, or Azariah. So they entered the king's service.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">In every matter of wisdom and insight the king asked them about, he found them to be ten times better than any of the magicians and astrologers that were in his entire empire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now Daniel lived on until the first year of Cyrus the king.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the second year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar had many dreams. His mind was disturbed and he suffered from insomnia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The king issued an order to summon the magicians, astrologers, sorcerers, and wise men in order to explain his dreams to him. So they came and awaited the king's instructions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The king told them, "I have had a dream, and I am anxious to understand the dream."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The wise men replied to the king: [What follows is in Aramaic ] "O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will disclose its interpretation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king replied to the wise men, "My decision is firm. If you do not inform me of both the dream and its interpretation, you will be dismembered and your homes reduced to rubble!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if you can disclose the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts, a reward, and considerable honor. So disclose to me the dream and its interpretation!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They again replied, "Let the king inform us of the dream; then we will disclose its interpretation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The king replied, "I know for sure that you are attempting to gain time, because you see that my decision is firm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If you don't inform me of the dream, there is only one thing that is going to happen to you. For you have agreed among yourselves to report to me something false and deceitful until such time as things might change. So tell me the dream, and I will have confidence that you can disclose its interpretation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The wise men replied to the king, "There is no man on earth who is able to disclose the king's secret, for no king, regardless of his position and power, has ever requested such a thing from any magician, astrologer, or wise man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">What the king is asking is too difficult, and no one exists who can disclose it to the king, except for the gods - but they don't live among mortals!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Because of this the king got furiously angry and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So a decree went out, and the wise men were about to be executed. They also sought Daniel and his friends so that they could be executed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Daniel spoke with prudent counsel to Arioch, who was in charge of the king's executioners and who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He inquired of Arioch the king's deputy, "Why is the decree from the king so urgent?" Then Arioch informed Daniel about the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Daniel went in and requested the king to grant him time, that he might disclose the interpretation to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel went to his home and informed his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He asked them to pray for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery so that he and his friends would not be destroyed along with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then in a night vision the mystery was revealed to Daniel. So Daniel praised the God of heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, "Let the name of God be praised forever and ever, for wisdom and power belong to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He changes times and seasons, deposing some kings and establishing others. He gives wisdom to the wise; he imparts knowledge to those with understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">he reveals deep and hidden things. He knows what is in the darkness, and light resides with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">O God of my fathers, I acknowledge and glorify you, for you have bestowed wisdom and power on me. Now you have enabled me to understand what I requested from you. For you have enabled me to understand the king's dilemma."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Daniel went in to see Arioch (whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon). He came and said to him, "Don't destroy the wise men of Babylon! Escort me to the king, and I will disclose the interpretation to him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So Arioch quickly ushered Daniel into the king's presence, saying to him, "I have found a man from the captives of Judah who can make known the interpretation to the king."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king then asked Daniel (whose name was also Belteshazzar), "Are you able to make known to me the dream that I saw, as well as its interpretation?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Daniel replied to the king, "The mystery that the king is asking about is such that no wise men, astrologers, magicians, or diviners can possibly disclose it to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the times to come. The dream and the visions you had while lying on your bed are as follows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">"As for you, O king, while you were in your bed your thoughts turned to future things. The revealer of mysteries has made known to you what will take place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">As for me, this mystery was revealed to me not because I possess more wisdom than any other living person, but so that the king may understand the interpretation and comprehend the thoughts of your mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">"You, O king, were watching as a great statue - one of impressive size and extraordinary brightness - was standing before you. Its appearance caused alarm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">As for that statue, its head was of fine gold, its chest and arms were of silver, its belly and thighs were of bronze.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Its legs were of iron; its feet were partly of iron and partly of clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You were watching as a stone was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its iron and clay feet, breaking them in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were broken in pieces without distinction and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors that the wind carries away. Not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a large mountain that filled the entire earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This was the dream. Now we will set forth before the king its interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">"You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has granted you sovereignty, power, strength, and honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Wherever human beings, wild animals, and birds of the sky live - he has given them into your power. He has given you authority over them all. You are the head of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now after you another kingdom will arise, one inferior to yours. Then a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule in all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then there will be a fourth kingdom, one strong like iron. Just like iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything, and as iron breaks in pieces all of these metals, so it will break in pieces and crush the others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">In that you were seeing feet and toes partly of wet clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom. Some of the strength of iron will be in it, for you saw iron mixed with wet clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">In that the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, the latter stages of this kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And in that you saw iron mixed with wet clay, so people will be mixed with one another without adhering to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">In the days of those kings the God of heaven will raise up an everlasting kingdom that will not be destroyed and a kingdom that will not be left to another people. It will break in pieces and bring about the demise of all these kingdoms. But it will stand forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">You saw that a stone was cut from a mountain, but not by human hands; it smashed the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold into pieces. The great God has made known to the king what will occur in the future. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is reliable."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed down with his face to the ground and paid homage to Daniel. He gave orders to offer sacrifice and incense to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The king replied to Daniel, "Certainly your God is a God of gods and Lord of kings and revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then the king elevated Daniel to high position and bestowed on him many marvelous gifts. He granted him authority over the entire province of Babylon and made him the main prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And at Daniel's request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the administration of the province of Babylon. Daniel himself served in the king's court.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">King Nebuchadnezzar had a golden statue made. It was ninety feet tall and nine feet wide. He erected it on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent out a summons to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, counselors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other authorities of the province to attend the dedication of the statue that he had erected.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So the satraps, prefects, governors, counselors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other provincial authorities assembled for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had erected. They were standing in front of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had erected.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the herald made a loud proclamation: "To you, O peoples, nations, and language groups, the following command is given:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, trigon, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music, you must bow down and pay homage to the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has erected.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Whoever does not bow down and pay homage will immediately be thrown into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore when they all heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, trigon, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations, and language groups began bowing down and paying homage to the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had erected.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought malicious accusations against the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You have issued an edict, O king, that everyone must bow down and pay homage to the golden statue when they hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, trigon, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And whoever does not bow down and pay homage must be thrown into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But there are Jewish men whom you appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon - Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego - and these men have not shown proper respect to you, O king. They don't serve your gods and they don't pay homage to the golden statue that you have erected."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Nebuchadnezzar in a fit of rage demanded that they bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego before him. So they brought them before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nebuchadnezzar said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don't serve my gods and that you don't pay homage to the golden statue that I erected?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now if you are ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, trigon, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music, you must bow down and pay homage to the statue that I had made. If you don't pay homage to it, you will immediately be thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire. Now, who is that god who can rescue you from my power?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to King Nebuchadnezzar, "We do not need to give you a reply concerning this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If our God whom we are serving exists, he is able to rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire, and he will rescue us, O king, from your power as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we don't serve your gods, and we will not pay homage to the golden statue that you have erected."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage, and his disposition changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than it was normally heated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He ordered strong soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So those men were tied up while still wearing their cloaks, trousers, turbans, and other clothes, and were thrown into the furnace of blazing fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But since the king's command was so urgent, and the furnace was so excessively hot, the men who escorted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were killed by the leaping flames.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But those three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell into the furnace of blazing fire while still securely bound.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then King Nebuchadnezzar was startled and quickly got up. He said to his ministers, "Wasn't it three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?" They replied to the king, "For sure, O king."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered, "But I see four men, untied and walking around in the midst of the fire! No harm has come to them! And the appearance of the fourth is like that of a god!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire. He called out, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the most high God, come out! Come here!"Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego emerged from the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Once the satraps, prefects, governors, and ministers of the king had gathered around, they saw that those men were physically unharmed by the fire. The hair of their heads was not singed, nor were their trousers damaged. Not even the smell of fire was to be found on them!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed, "Praised be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent forth his angel and has rescued his servants who trusted in him, ignoring the edict of the king and giving up their bodies rather than serve or pay homage to any god other than their God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I hereby decree that any people, nation, or language group that blasphemes the god of Shadrach, Meshach, or Abednego will be dismembered and his home reduced to rubble! For there exists no other god who can deliver in this way."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then Nebuchadnezzar promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">"King Nebuchadnezzar, to all peoples, nations, and language groups that live in all the land: Peace and prosperity!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I am delighted to tell you about the signs and wonders that the most high God has done for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"How great are his signs! How mighty are his wonders! His kingdom will last forever, and his authority continues from one generation to the next."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I, Nebuchadnezzar, was relaxing in my home, living luxuriously in my palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I saw a dream that frightened me badly. The things I imagined while lying on my bed - these visions of my mind - were terrifying me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So I issued an order for all the wise men of Babylon to be brought before me so that they could make known to me the interpretation of the dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When the magicians, astrologers, wise men, and diviners entered, I recounted the dream for them. But they were unable to make known its interpretation to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Later Daniel entered (whose name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom there is a spirit of the holy gods). I recounted the dream for him as well,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">saying, "Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, in whom I know there to be a spirit of the holy gods and whom no mystery baffles, consider my dream that I saw and set forth its interpretation!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Here are the visions of my mind while I was on my bed.While I was watching, there was a tree in the middle of the land. It was enormously tall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The tree grew large and strong. Its top reached far into the sky; it could be seen from the borders of all the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Its foliage was attractive and its fruit plentiful; on it there was food enough for all. Under it the wild animals used to seek shade, and in its branches the birds of the sky used to nest. All creatures used to feed themselves from it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">While I was watching in my mind's visions on my bed, a holy sentinel came down from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He called out loudly as follows: 'Chop down the tree and lop off its branches! Strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit! Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But leave its taproot in the ground, with a band of iron and bronze around it surrounded by the grass of the field. Let it become damp with the dew of the sky, and let it live with the animals in the grass of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let his mind be altered from that of a human being, and let an animal's mind be given to him, and let seven periods of time go by for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This announcement is by the decree of the sentinels; this decision is by the pronouncement of the holy ones, so that those who are alive may understand that the Most High has authority over human kingdoms, and he bestows them on whomever he wishes. He establishes over them even the lowliest of human beings.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">"This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, for none of the wise men in my kingdom are able to make known to me the interpretation. But you can do so, for a spirit of the holy gods is in you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Daniel (whose name is also Belteshazzar) was upset for a brief time; his thoughts were alarming him. The king said, "Belteshazzar, don't let the dream and its interpretation alarm you." But Belteshazzar replied, "Sir, if only the dream were for your enemies and its interpretation applied to your adversaries!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The tree that you saw that grew large and strong, whose top reached to the sky, and which could be seen in all the land,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">whose foliage was attractive and its fruit plentiful, and from which there was food available for all, under whose branches wild animals used to live, and in whose branches birds of the sky used to nest -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">it is you, O king! For you have become great and strong. Your greatness is such that it reaches to heaven, and your authority to the ends of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">As for the king seeing a holy sentinel coming down from heaven and saying, 'Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave its taproot in the ground, with a band of iron and bronze around it, surrounded by the grass of the field. Let it become damp with the dew of the sky, and let it live with the wild animals, until seven periods of time go by for him' -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">this is the interpretation, O king! It is the decision of the Most High that this has happened to my lord the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">You will be driven from human society, and you will live with the wild animals. You will be fed grass like oxen, and you will become damp with the dew of the sky. Seven periods of time will pass by for you, before you understand that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms and gives them to whomever he wishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They said to leave the taproot of the tree, for your kingdom will be restored to you when you come to understand that heaven rules.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore, O king, may my advice be pleasing to you. Break away from your sins by doing what is right, and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor. Perhaps your prosperity will be prolonged."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now all of this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">After twelve months, he happened to be walking around on the battlements of the royal palace of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The king uttered these words: "Is this not the great Babylon that I have built for a royal residence by my own mighty strength and for my majestic honor?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">While these words were still on the king's lips, a voice came down from heaven: "It is hereby announced to you, King Nebuchadnezzar, that your kingdom has been removed from you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">You will be driven from human society, and you will live with the wild animals. You will be fed grass like oxen, and seven periods of time will pass by for you before you understand that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms and gives them to whomever he wishes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now in that very moment this pronouncement about Nebuchadnezzar came true. He was driven from human society, he ate grass like oxen, and his body became damp with the dew of the sky, until his hair became long like an eagle's feathers, and his nails like a bird's claws.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But at the end of the appointed time I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up toward heaven, and my sanity returned to me.I extolled the Most High, and I praised and glorified the one who lives forever. For his authority is an everlasting authority, and his kingdom extends from one generation to the next.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">All the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he wishes with the army of heaven and with those who inhabit the earth. No one slaps his hand and says to him, 'What have you done?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">At that time my sanity returned to me. I was restored to the honor of my kingdom, and my splendor returned to me. My ministers and my nobles were seeking me out, and I was reinstated over my kingdom. I became even greater than before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, for all his deeds are right and his ways are just. He is able to bring down those who live in pride.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">King Belshazzar prepared a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles, and he was drinking wine in front of them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">While under the influence of the wine, Belshazzar issued an order to bring in the gold and silver vessels - the ones that Nebuchadnezzar his father had confiscated from the temple in Jerusalem - so that the king and his nobles, together with his wives and his concubines, could drink from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So they brought the gold and silver vessels that had been confiscated from the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, together with his wives and concubines, drank from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As they drank wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">At that very moment the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the royal palace wall, opposite the lampstand. The king was watching the back of the hand that was writing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then all the color drained from the king's face and he became alarmed. The joints of his hips gave way, and his knees began knocking together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The king called out loudly to summon the astrologers, wise men, and diviners. The king proclaimed to the wise men of Babylon that anyone who could read this inscription and disclose its interpretation would be clothed in purple and have a golden collar placed on his neck and be third ruler in the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So all the king's wise men came in, but they were unable to read the writing or to make known its interpretation to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then King Belshazzar was very terrified, and he was visibly shaken. His nobles were completely dumbfounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Due to the noise caused by the king and his nobles, the queen mother then entered the banquet room. She said, "O king, live forever! Don't be alarmed! Don't be shaken!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is a man in your kingdom who has within him a spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father, he proved to have insight, discernment, and wisdom like that of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar your father appointed him chief of the magicians, astrologers, wise men, and diviners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Thus there was found in this man Daniel, whom the king renamed Belteshazzar, an extraordinary spirit, knowledge, and skill to interpret dreams, solve riddles, and decipher knotty problems. Now summon Daniel, and he will disclose the interpretation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Daniel was brought in before the king. The king said to Daniel, "Are you that Daniel who is one of the captives of Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have heard about you, how there is a spirit of the gods in you, and how you have insight, discernment, and extraordinary wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now the wise men and astrologers were brought before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation. But they were unable to disclose the interpretation of the message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">However, I have heard that you are able to provide interpretations and to decipher knotty problems. Now if you are able to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, you will wear purple and have a golden collar around your neck and be third ruler in the kingdom."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Daniel replied to the king, "Keep your gifts, and give your rewards to someone else! However, I will read the writing for the king and make known its interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As for you, O king, the most high God bestowed on your father Nebuchadnezzar a kingdom, greatness, honor, and majesty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Due to the greatness that he bestowed on him, all peoples, nations, and language groups were trembling with fear before him. He killed whom he wished, he spared whom he wished, he exalted whom he wished, and he brought low whom he wished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when his mind became arrogant and his spirit filled with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and his honor was removed from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He was driven from human society, his mind was changed to that of an animal, he lived with the wild donkeys, he was fed grass like oxen, and his body became damp with the dew of the sky, until he came to understand that the most high God rules over human kingdoms, and he appoints over them whomever he wishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">"But you, his son Belshazzar, have not humbled yourself, although you knew all this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. You brought before you the vessels from his temple, and you and your nobles, together with your wives and concubines, drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone - gods that cannot see or hear or comprehend! But you have not glorified the God who has in his control your very breath and all your ways!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore the palm of a hand was sent from him, and this writing was inscribed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">"This is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEQEL, and PHARSIN.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">This is the interpretation of the words: As for mene - God has numbered your kingdom's days and brought it to an end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As for teqel - you are weighed on the balances and found to be lacking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">As for peres - your kingdom is divided and given over to the Medes and Persians."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then, on Belshazzar's orders, Daniel was clothed in purple, a golden collar was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed third ruler in the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And in that very night Belshazzar, the Babylonian king, was killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So Darius the Mede took control of the kingdom when he was about sixty-two years old.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It seemed like a good idea to Darius to appoint over the kingdom 120 satraps who would be in charge of the entire kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Over them would be three supervisors, one of whom was Daniel. These satraps were accountable to them, so that the king's interests might not incur damage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now this Daniel was distinguishing himself above the other supervisors and the satraps, for he had an extraordinary spirit. In fact, the king intended to appoint him over the entire kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Consequently the supervisors and satraps were trying to find some pretext against Daniel in connection with administrative matters. But they were unable to find any such damaging evidence, because he was trustworthy and guilty of no negligence or corruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So these men concluded, "We won't find any pretext against this man Daniel unless it is in connection with the law of his God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So these supervisors and satraps came by collusion to the king and said to him, "O King Darius, live forever!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">To all the supervisors of the kingdom, the prefects, satraps, counselors, and governors it seemed like a good idea for a royal edict to be issued and an interdict to be enforced. For the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human other than you, O king, should be thrown into a den of lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now let the king issue a written interdict so that it cannot be altered, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So King Darius issued the written interdict.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Daniel realized that a written decree had been issued, he entered his home, where the windows in his upper room opened toward Jerusalem. Three times daily he was kneeling and offering prayers and thanks to his God just as he had been accustomed to do previously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then those officials who had gone to the king came by collusion and found Daniel praying and asking for help before his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So they approached the king and said to him, "Did you not issue an edict to the effect that for the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human other than to you, O king, would be thrown into a den of lions?" The king replied, "That is correct, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then they said to the king, "Daniel, who is one of the captives from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the edict that you issued. Three times daily he offers his prayer."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When the king heard this, he was very upset and began thinking about how he might rescue Daniel. Until late afternoon he was struggling to find a way to rescue him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then those men came by collusion to the king and said to him, "Recall, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no edict or decree that the king issues can be changed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So the king gave the order, and Daniel was brought and thrown into a den of lions. The king consoled Daniel by saying, "Your God whom you continually serve will rescue you!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then a stone was brought and placed over the opening to the den. The king sealed it with his signet ring and with those of his nobles so that nothing could be changed with regard to Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king departed to his palace. But he spent the night without eating, and no diversions were brought to him. He was unable to sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In the morning, at the earliest sign of daylight, the king got up and rushed to the lions' den.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As he approached the den, he called out to Daniel in a worried voice, "Daniel, servant of the living God, was your God whom you continually serve able to rescue you from the lions?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Daniel spoke to the king, "O king, live forever!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">My God sent his angel and closed the lions' mouths so that they have not harmed me, because I was found to be innocent before him. Nor have I done any harm to you, O king."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then the king was delighted and gave an order to haul Daniel up from the den. So Daniel was hauled up out of the den. He had no injury of any kind, because he had trusted in his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The king gave another order, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the lions' den - they, their children, and their wives. They did not even reach the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and language groups who were living in all the land: "Peace and prosperity!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I have issued an edict that throughout all the dominion of my kingdom people are to revere and fear the God of Daniel."For he is the living God; he endures forever. His kingdom will not be destroyed; his authority is forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He rescues and delivers and performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth. He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream filled with visions while he was lying on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream in summary fashion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Daniel explained: "I was watching in my vision during the night as the four winds of the sky were stirring up the great sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then four large beasts came up from the sea; they were different from one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">"The first one was like a lion with eagles' wings. As I watched, its wings were pulled off and it was lifted up from the ground. It was made to stand on two feet like a human being, and a human mind was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"Then a second beast appeared, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and there were three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and devour much flesh!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"After these things, as I was watching, another beast like a leopard appeared, with four bird-like wings on its back. This beast had four heads, and ruling authority was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"After these things, as I was watching in the night visions a fourth beast appeared - one dreadful, terrible, and very strong. It had two large rows of iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and anything that was left it trampled with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that came before it, and it had ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"As I was contemplating the horns, another horn - a small one - came up between them, and three of the former horns were torn out by the roots to make room for it. This horn had eyes resembling human eyes and a mouth speaking arrogant things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">"While I was watching,thrones were set up, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His attire was white like snow; the hair of his head was like lamb's wool. His throne was ablaze with fire and its wheels were all aflame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A river of fire was streaming forth and proceeding from his presence. Many thousands were ministering to him; Many tens of thousands stood ready to serve him. The court convened and the books were opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"Then I kept on watching because of the arrogant words of the horn that was speaking. I was watching until the beast was killed and its body destroyed and thrown into the flaming fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As for the rest of the beasts, their ruling authority had already been removed, though they were permitted to go on living for a time and a season.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I was watching in the night visions,"And with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man was approaching. He went up to the Ancient of Days and was escorted before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">To him was given ruling authority, honor, and sovereignty. All peoples, nations, and language groups were serving him. His authority is eternal and will not pass away. His kingdom will not be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed, and the visions of my mind were alarming me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I approached one of those standing nearby and asked him about the meaning of all this. So he spoke with me and revealed to me the interpretation of the vision:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">'These large beasts, which are four in number, represent four kings who will arise from the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will take possession of the kingdom forever and ever.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">"Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others. It was very dreadful, with two rows of iron teeth and bronze claws, and it devoured, crushed, and trampled anything that was left with its feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I also wanted to know the meaning of the ten horns on its head, and of that other horn which came up and before which three others fell. This was the horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking arrogant things, whose appearance was more formidable than the others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">While I was watching, that horn began to wage war against the holy ones and was defeating them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">until the Ancient of Days arrived and judgment was rendered in favor of the holy ones of the Most High. Then the time came for the holy ones to take possession of the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">"This is what he told me: 'The fourth beast means that there will be a fourth kingdom on earth that will differ from all the other kingdoms. It will devour all the earth and will trample and crush it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The ten horns mean that ten kings will arise from that kingdom. Another king will arise after them, but he will be different from the earlier ones. He will humiliate three kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He will speak words against the Most High. He will harass the holy ones of the Most High continually. His intention will be to change times established by law. They will be delivered into his hand For a time, times, and half a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the court will convene, and his ruling authority will be removed - destroyed and abolished forever!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the kingdom, authority, and greatness of the kingdoms under all of heaven will be delivered to the people of the holy ones of the Most High. His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; all authorities will serve him and obey him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">"This is the conclusion of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me greatly, and the color drained from my face. But I kept the matter to myself."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that had appeared to me previously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In this vision I saw myself in Susa the citadel, which is located in the province of Elam. In the vision I saw myself at the Ulai Canal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I looked up and saw a ram with two horns standing at the canal. Its two horns were both long, but one was longer than the other. The longer one was coming up after the shorter one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I saw that the ram was butting westward, northward, and southward. No animal was able to stand before it, and there was none who could deliver from its power. It did as it pleased and acted arrogantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">While I was contemplating all this, a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of all the land without touching the ground. This goat had a conspicuous horn between its eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It came to the two-horned ram that I had seen standing beside the canal and rushed against it with raging strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I saw it approaching the ram. It went into a fit of rage against the ram and struck it and broke off its two horns. The ram had no ability to resist it. The goat hurled the ram to the ground and trampled it. No one could deliver the ram from its power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The male goat acted even more arrogantly. But no sooner had the large horn become strong than it was broken, and there arose four conspicuous horns in its place, extending toward the four winds of the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">From one of them came a small horn. But it grew to be very big, toward the south and the east and toward the beautiful land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">It grew so big it reached the army of heaven, and it brought about the fall of some of the army and some of the stars to the ground, where it trampled them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">It also acted arrogantly against the Prince of the army, from whom the daily sacrifice was removed and whose sanctuary was thrown down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The army was given over, along with the daily sacrifice, in the course of his sinful rebellion. It hurled truth to the ground and enjoyed success.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard a holy one speaking. Another holy one said to the one who was speaking, "To what period of time does the vision pertain - this vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the destructive act of rebellion and the giving over of both the sanctuary and army to be trampled?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said to me, "To 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be put right again."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">While I, Daniel, was watching the vision, I sought to understand it. Now one who appeared to be a man was standing before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then I heard a human voice coming from between the banks of the Ulai. It called out, "Gabriel, enable this person to understand the vision."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he approached the place where I was standing. As he came, I felt terrified and fell flat on the ground. Then he said to me, "Understand, son of man, that the vision pertains to the time of the end."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As he spoke with me, I fell into a trance with my face to the ground. But he touched me and stood me upright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then he said, "I am going to inform you about what will happen in the latter time of wrath, for the vision pertains to the appointed time of the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The ram that you saw with the two horns stands for the kings of Media and Persia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The male goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The horn that was broken and in whose place there arose four others stands for four kingdoms that will arise from his nation, though they will not have his strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Toward the end of their rule, when rebellious acts are complete, a rash and deceitful king will arise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">His power will be great, but it will not be by his strength alone. He will cause terrible destruction. He will be successful in what he undertakes. He will destroy powerful people and the people of the holy ones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">By his treachery he will succeed through deceit. He will have an arrogant attitude, and he will destroy many who are unaware of his schemes. He will rise up against the Prince of princes, yet he will be broken apart - but not by human agency.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The vision of the evenings and mornings that was told to you is correct. But you should seal up the vision, for it refers to a time many days from now."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days. Then I got up and again carried out the king's business. But I was astonished at the vision, and there was no one to explain it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus, who was of Median descent and who had been appointed king over the Babylonian empire -</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, came to understand from the sacred books that, according to the word of the LORD disclosed to the prophet Jeremiah, the years for the fulfilling of the desolation of Jerusalem were seventy in number.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So I turned my attention to the Lord God to implore him by prayer and requests, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I prayed to the LORD my God, confessing in this way:"O Lord, great and awesome God who is faithful to his covenant with those who love him and keep his commandments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">we have sinned! We have done what is wrong and wicked; we have rebelled by turning away from your commandments and standards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We have not paid attention to your servants the prophets, who spoke by your authority to our kings, our leaders, and our ancestors, and to all the inhabitants of the land as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"You are righteous, O Lord, but we are humiliated this day - the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far away in all the countries in which you have scattered them, because they have behaved unfaithfully toward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">O LORD, we have been humiliated - our kings, our leaders, and our ancestors - because we have sinned against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yet the Lord our God is compassionate and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">We have not obeyed the LORD our God by living according to his laws that he set before us through his servants the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"All Israel has broken your law and turned away by not obeying you. Therefore you have poured out on us the judgment solemnly threatened in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He has carried out his threats against us and our rulers who were over us by bringing great calamity on us - what has happened to Jerusalem has never been equaled under all heaven!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Just as it is written in the law of Moses, so all this calamity has come on us. Still we have not tried to pacify the LORD our God by turning back from our sin and by seeking wisdom from your reliable moral standards.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The following is the message which God revealed to Habakkuk the prophet:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">How long, <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, must I cry for help? But you do not listen! I call out to you, "Violence!" But you do not intervene!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Why do you force me to witness injustice? Why do you put up with wrongdoing? Destruction and violence confront me; conflict is present and one must endure strife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For this reason the law lacks power, and justice is never carried out. Indeed, the wicked intimidate the innocent. For this reason justice is perverted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"Look at the nations and pay attention! You will be shocked and amazed! For I will do something in your lifetime that you will not believe even though you are forewarned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Look, I am about to empower the Babylonians, that ruthless and greedy nation. They sweep across the surface of the earth, seizing dwelling places that do not belong to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They are frightening and terrifying; they decide for themselves what is right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Their horses are faster than leopards and more alert than wolves in the desert. Their horses gallop, their horses come a great distance; like a vulture they swoop down quickly to devour their prey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All of them intend to do violence; every face is determined. They take prisoners as easily as one scoops up sand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They mock kings and laugh at rulers. They laugh at every fortified city; they build siege ramps and capture them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They sweep by like the wind and pass on. But the one who considers himself a god will be held guilty."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">
        <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, you have been active from ancient times; my sovereign God, you are immortal. <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>, you have made them your instrument of judgment. Protector, you have appointed them as your instrument of punishment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You are too just to tolerate evil; you are unable to condone wrongdoing. So why do you put up with such treacherous people? Why do you say nothing when the wicked devour those more righteous than they are?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You made people like fish in the sea, like animals in the sea that have no ruler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Babylonian tyrant pulls them all up with a fishhook; he hauls them in with his throw net. When he catches them in his dragnet, he is very happy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Because of his success he offers sacrifices to his throw net and burns incense to his dragnet; for because of them he has plenty of food, and more than enough to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Will he then continue to fill and empty his throw net? Will he always destroy nations and spare none?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For the message is a witness to what is decreed; it gives reliable testimony about how matters will turn out. Even if the message is not fulfilled right away, wait patiently; for it will certainly come to pass - it will not arrive late.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Look, the one whose desires are not upright will faint from exhaustion, but the person of integrity will live because of his faithfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Indeed, wine will betray the proud, restless man! His appetite is as big as Sheol's; like death, he is never satisfied. He gathers all the nations; he seizes all peoples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">"But all these nations will someday taunt him and ridicule him with proverbial sayings: 'The one who accumulates what does not belong to him is as good as dead (How long will this go on?) - he who gets rich by extortion!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Your creditors will suddenly attack; those who terrify you will spring into action, and they will rob you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Because you robbed many countries, all who are left among the nations will rob you. You have shed human blood and committed violent acts against lands, cities, and those who live in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The one who builds his house by unjust gain is as good as dead. He does this so he can build his nest way up high and escape the clutches of disaster.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Your schemes will bring shame to your house. Because you destroyed many nations, you will self-destruct.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the stones in the walls will cry out, and the wooden rafters will answer back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The one who builds a city by bloodshed is as good as dead - he who starts a town by unjust deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Be sure of this! The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who commands armies has decreed: The nations' efforts will go up in smoke; their exhausting work will be for nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For recognition of the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s sovereign majesty will fill the earth just as the waters fill up the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"You who force your neighbor to drink wine are as good as dead - you who make others intoxicated by forcing them to drink from the bowl of your furious anger, so you can look at their genitals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But you will become drunk with shame, not majesty. Now it is your turn to drink and expose your uncircumcised foreskin! The cup of wine in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s right hand is coming to you, and disgrace will replace your majestic glory!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For you will pay in full for your violent acts against Lebanon; terrifying judgment will come upon you because of the way you destroyed the wild animals living there. You have shed human blood and committed violent acts against lands, cities, and those who live in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">What good is an idol? Why would a craftsman make it? What good is a metal image that gives misleading oracles? Why would its creator place his trust in it and make such mute, worthless things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The one who says to wood, 'Wake up!' is as good as dead - he who says to speechless stone, 'Awake!' Can it give reliable guidance? It is overlaid with gold and silver; it has no life's breath inside it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">God comes from Teman, the sovereign one from Mount Paran. Selah. His splendor covers the skies, his glory fills the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He is as bright as lightning; a two-pronged lightning bolt flashes from his hand. This is the outward display of his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Plague goes before him; pestilence marches right behind him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He takes his battle position and shakes the earth; with a mere look he frightens the nations. The ancient mountains disintegrate; the primeval hills are flattened. He travels on the ancient roads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I see the tents of Cushan overwhelmed by trouble; the tent curtains of the land of Midian are shaking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Is the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> mad at the rivers? Are you angry with the rivers? Are you enraged at the sea? Is this why you climb into your horse-drawn chariots, your victorious chariots?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Your bow is ready for action; you commission your arrows. Selah. You cause flash floods on the earth's surface.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When the mountains see you, they shake. The torrential downpour sweeps through. The great deep shouts out; it lifts its hands high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The sun and moon stand still in their courses; the flash of your arrows drives them away, the bright light of your lightning-quick spear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You furiously stomp on the earth, you angrily trample down the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You march out to deliver your people, to deliver your special servant. You strike the leader of the wicked nation, laying him open from the lower body to the neck. Selah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">But you trample on the sea with your horses, on the surging, raging waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I listened and my stomach churned; the sound made my lips quiver. My frame went limp, as if my bones were decaying, and I shook as I tried to walk. I long for the day of distress to come upon the people who attack us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When the fig tree does not bud, and there are no grapes on the vines; when the olive trees do not produce, and the fields yield no crops; when the sheep disappear from the pen, and there are no cattle in the stalls,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who rules over all says this: "These people have said, 'The time for rebuilding the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple has not yet come.'"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke through the prophet Haggai as follows:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Here then is what the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who rules over all says: 'Think carefully about what you are doing.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Haggai asked, "If a person who is ritually unclean because of touching a dead body comes in contact with one of these items, will it become unclean?" The priests answered, "It will be unclean."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Haggai responded, "'The people of this nation are unclean in my sight,' says the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>. 'And so is all their effort; everything they offer is also unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore reflect carefully on the recent past, before one stone was laid on another in the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE>'s temple.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Then the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> spoke again to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">The <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> then addressed good, comforting words to the angelic messenger who was speaking to me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Next the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> showed me four blacksmiths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I asked, "What are these going to do?" He answered, "These horns are the ones that have scattered Judah so that there is no one to be seen.

      <VERS vnumber="3">There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right of the receptacle and the other on the left."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then I asked the messenger who spoke with me, "What are these, sir?"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">"What are you, you great mountain? Because of Zerubbabel you will become a level plain! And he will bring forth the temple capstone with shoutings of 'Grace! Grace!' because of this."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Next I asked the messenger, "What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the menorah?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Before he could reply I asked again, "What are these two extensions of the olive trees, which are emptying out the golden oil through the two golden pipes?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He replied, "Don't you know what these are?" And I said, "No, sir."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">The speaker went on to say, "This is a curse traveling across the whole earth. For example, according to the curse whoever steals will be removed from the community; or on the other hand (according to the curse) whoever swears falsely will suffer the same fate."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">"I will send it out," says the <STYLE id="cl:divineName">LORD</STYLE> who rules over all, "and it will enter the house of the thief and of the person who swears falsely in my name. It will land in the middle of his house and destroy both timber and stones."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">After this the angelic messenger who had been speaking to me went out and said, "Look, see what is leaving."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I asked, "What is it?" And he replied, "It is a basket for measuring grain that is moving away from here." Moreover, he said, "This is their 'eye' throughout all the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then a round lead cover was raised up, revealing a woman sitting inside the basket.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He then said, "This woman represents wickedness," and he pushed her down into the basket and placed the lead cover on top.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then I looked again and saw two women going forth with the wind in their wings (they had wings like those of a stork) and they lifted up the basket between the earth and the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I asked the messenger who was speaking to me, "Where are they taking the basket?"</VERS>
