      <VERS vnumber="1">Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and Yahweh his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers` [houses].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to [the place] that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tent of Yahweh: and Solomon and the assembly sought to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Solomon went up there to the brazen altar before Yahweh, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In that night did God appear to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Solomon said to God, You have showed great lovingkindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this your people, that is so great?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of those who hate you, neither yet have asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">wisdom and knowledge is granted to you; and I will give you riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you; neither shall there any after you have the like.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had one thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king`s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">He made also ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yahweh was finished. Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers` [houses] of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, which is Zion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">nd all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was [in] the seventh month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">All the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests the Levites bring up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the poles of it above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there it is to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put [there] at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">It happened, when the priests were come out of the holy place, (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">it happened, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Yahweh; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh, [saying], For he is good; for his lovingkindness endures forever; that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Yahweh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then spoke Solomon, Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But I have built you a house of habitation, and a place for you to dwell in forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Yahweh said to David my father, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house for my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yahweh has performed his word that he spoke; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There have I set the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">(for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and on it he stood, and kneeled down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and he said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven, or on earth; who keep covenant and lovingkindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">who have kept with your servant David my father that which you did promise him: yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can`t contain you; how much less this house which I have built!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet have you respect to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof you have said that you would put your name there; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Listen you to the petitions of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yes, hear from your dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before your altar in this house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">then hear from heaven, and do, and judge your servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way on his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">then hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you do afflict them:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for your great name`s sake, and your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, and fear you, as does your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, and the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling-place, their prayer and their petitions, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Now, my God, let, I beg you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now therefore arise, Yahweh God, into your resting-place, you, and the ark of your strength: let your priests, Yahweh God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints rejoice in goodness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Yahweh God, don`t turn away the face of your anointed: remember [your] lovingkindnesses to David your servant.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Yahweh filled the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The priests could not enter into the house of Yahweh, because the glory of Yahweh filled Yahweh`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of Yahweh was on the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshipped, and gave thanks to Yahweh, [saying], For he is good; for his lovingkindness endures for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of Yahweh, which David the king had made to give thanks to Yahweh, (for his lovingkindness endures for ever,) when David praised by their ministry: and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Moreover Solomon made the middle of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered the burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Yahweh had showed to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus Solomon finished the house of Yahweh, and the king`s house: and all that came into Solomon`s heart to make in the house of Yahweh, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">If I shut up the sky so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For now have I chosen and made this house holy, that my name may be there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">As for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I covenanted with David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">This house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They shall answer, Because they forsook Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore has he brought all this evil on them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of Yahweh, and his own house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As for all the people who were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">of their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel didn`t consume, of them did Solomon raise a levy [of bondservants] to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">These were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two hundred fifty, who ruled over the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house that he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of Yahweh has come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Solomon offered burnt-offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh, which he had built before the porch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, [even] in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They didn`t depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of Yahweh, and until it was finished. [So] the house of Yahweh was completed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants who had knowledge of the sea; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from there four hundred fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she talked with him of all that was in her heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hid from Solomon which he didn`t tell her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their clothing, his cup bearers also, and their clothing, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">She said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">However I didn`t believe their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me: you exceed the fame that I heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, and hear your wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on his throne, to be king for Yahweh your God: because your God loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore made he you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum-trees and precious stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The king made of the algum-trees terraces for the house of Yahweh, and for the king`s house, and harps and psalteries for the singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">besides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred [shekels] of beaten gold went to one buckler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">[he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred [shekels] of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">nd there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">All king Solomon`s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, aren`t they written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon,) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He said to them, Come again to me after three days. The people departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give you me to return answer to this people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They spoke to him, saying, If you be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said to them, What counsel give you, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that your father did put on us lighter?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you tell the people who spoke to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us; thus shall you say to them, My little finger is thicker than my father`s loins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the king didn`t listen to the people; for it was brought about of God, that Yahweh might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When all Israel saw that the king didn`t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, Israel: now see to your own house, David. So all Israel departed to their tents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Thus says Yahweh, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they listened to the words of Yahweh, and returned from going against Jeroboam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He built Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In every city [he put] shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest`s office to Yahweh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the male goats, and for the calves which he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, [and of] Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and she bore him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, [even] the prince among his brothers; for [he was minded] to make him king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city: and he gave them victuals in abundance. He sought [for them] many wives.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Yahweh, and all Israel with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Yahweh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus says Yahweh, You have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Yahweh is righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king`s house: he took all away: he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">It was so, that as often as the king entered into the house of Yahweh, the guard came and bore them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When he humbled himself, the wrath of Yahweh turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and moreover in Judah there were good things [found].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother`s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He did that which was evil, because he didn`t set his heart to seek Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, aren`t they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? There were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his place.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Ought you not to know that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There were gathered to him worthless men, base fellows, who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now you think to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David; and you are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Haven`t you driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of [other] lands? so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, the same may be a priest of [those who are] no gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and [we have] priests ministering to Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and they burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense: the show bread also [set they] in order on the pure table; and the lampstand of gold with the lamps of it, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Yahweh our God; but you have forsaken him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. Children of Israel, don`t you fight against Yahweh, the God of your fathers; for you shall not prosper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it happened, that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns of it, and Jeshanah with the towns of it, and Ephron with the towns of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Yahweh struck him, and he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Abijah grew mighty, and took to himself fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given him rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God; we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred eighty thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops, and three hundred chariots; and he came to Mareshah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Asa cried to Yahweh his God, and said, Yahweh, there is none besides you to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength: help us, Yahweh our God; for we rely on you, and in your name are we come against this multitude. Yahweh, you are our God; don`t let man prevail against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Yahweh, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They struck all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Yahweh came on them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They struck also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear you me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Yahweh is with you, while you are with him; and if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now for a long season Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when in their distress they turned to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but great vexations were on all the inhabitants of the lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God did vex them with all adversity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But be you strong, and don`t let your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of Yahweh, that was before the porch of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They entered into the covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and that whoever would not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They swore to Yahweh with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">All Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and Yahweh gave them rest round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">There was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the king`s house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">[There is] a league between me and you, as [there was] between my father and your father: behold, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Ben-hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha had built; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on Yahweh your God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Weren`t the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because you did rely on Yahweh, he delivered them into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For the eyes of Yahweh run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein you have done foolishly; for from henceforth you shall have wars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison-house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he didn`t seek Yahweh, but to the physicians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They buried him in his own tombs, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds [of spices] prepared by the perfumers` are: and they made a very great burning for him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn`t seek the Baals,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches and honor in abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">His heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh: and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? The man of God answered, Yahweh is able to give you much more than this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Amaziah separated them, [to wit], the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: why their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck of the children of Seir ten thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">[other] ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it happened, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of your hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It happened, as he talked with him, that [the king] said to him, Have we made you of the king`s counsel? Stop! Why should you be struck down? Then the prophet stopped, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not listened to my counsel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife: and there passed by a wild animal that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You say, Behold, you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast: abide now at home; why should you meddle to [your] hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand [of their enemies], because they had sought after the gods of Edom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">The consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: why their brothers the Levites did help them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">The thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, You children of Israel, turn again to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that have escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Don`t be you like your fathers, and like your brothers, who trespassed against Yahweh, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as you see.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the Passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Yahweh pardon everyone</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who sets his heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his fathers, though not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day, [singing] with loud instruments to Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who had good understanding [in the service] of Yahweh. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept [other] seven days with gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the sojourners who came out of the land of Israel, and who lived in Judah, rejoiced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">[He appointed] also the king`s portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings, [to wit], for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The children of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Yahweh their God, and laid them by heaps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Yahweh, and his people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since [the people] began to bring the offerings into the house of Yahweh, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty: for Yahweh has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Yahweh; and they prepared them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east [gate], was over the freewill-offerings of God, to distribute the offerings of Yahweh, and the most holy things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brothers by courses, as well to the great as to the small:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">besides those who were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone who entered into the house of Yahweh, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their courses;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and those who were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers` houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their courses;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and those who were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all who were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and he worked that which was good and right and faithful before Yahweh his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="32">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city; and they helped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the springs, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised [it] up to the towers, and the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo [in] the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spoke comfortably to them, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Be strong and of good courage, don`t be afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude who is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Yahweh our God to help us, and to fight our battles. The people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him,) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do you trust, that you abide the siege in Jerusalem?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Does not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Has not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, You shall worship before one altar, and on it shall you burn incense?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Don`t you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore don`t let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe you him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">His servants spoke yet more against Yahweh God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He wrote also letters, to rail on Yahweh, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of my hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They cried with a loud voice in the Jews` language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men`s hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yahweh sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. When he was come into the house of his god, those who came forth from his own bowels killed him there with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all [others], and guided them on every side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">In those days Hezekiah was sick even to death: and he prayed to Yahweh; and he spoke to him, and gave him a sign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Hezekiah didn`t render again according to the benefit done to him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath on him, and on Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Yahweh didn`t come on them in the days of Hezekiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">store-houses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of animals, and flocks in folds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">However in [the business of] the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. Manasseh his son reigned in his place.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="33">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baals, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of the sky, and served them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He built altars in the house of Yahweh, whereof Yahweh said, In Jerusalem shall my name be forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He built altars for all the host of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practiced sorcery, and used enchantments, and practiced sorcery, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He set the engraved image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances [given] by Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yahweh spoke to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When he was in distress, he begged Yahweh his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He prayed to him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Yahweh he was God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he compassed Ophel about [with it], and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Yahweh, and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of Yahweh, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He built up the altar of Yahweh, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only to Yahweh their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">His prayer also, and how [God] was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the engraved images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He didn`t humble himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">His servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="34">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in the ways of David his father, and didn`t turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the engraved images, and the molten images.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; and the sun-images that were on high above them he hewed down; and the Asherim, and the engraved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it on the graves [of those] who had sacrificed to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He burnt the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">[So did he] in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, in their ruins round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He broke down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the engraved images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Yahweh his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and the workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and [others of] the Levites, all who were skillful with instruments of music.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all who did the work in every manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Yahweh [given] by Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh. Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to your servants, they are doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Yahweh, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. Shaphan read therein before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It happened, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he tore his clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king`s servant, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Go you, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Yahweh, to do according to all that is written in this book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Hilkiah, and they whom the king [had commanded], went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spoke to her to that effect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">She said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Tell you the man who sent you to me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on the inhabitants of it, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out on this place, and it shall not be quenched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus shall you tell him, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: As touching the words which you have heard,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">because your heart was tender, and you did humble yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, and have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil that I will bring on this place, and on the inhabitants of it. They brought back word to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand [to it]. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Yahweh their God. All his days they didn`t depart from following Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="35">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Josiah kept a Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem: and they killed the Passover on the fourteenth [day] of the first month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to Yahweh, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden on your shoulders: now serve Yahweh your God, and his people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Prepare yourselves after your fathers` houses by your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers` houses of your brothers the children of the people, and [let there be for each] a portion of a fathers` house of the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Kill the Passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the word of Yahweh by Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the Passover-offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls: these were of the king`s substance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">His princes gave for a freewill- offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred [small cattle], and three hundred oxen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover-offerings five thousand [small cattle], and five hundred oxen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the king`s commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled [the blood which they received] of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers` houses of the children of the people, to offer to Yahweh, as it is written in the book of Moses. So did they with the oxen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron [were busied] in offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king`s seer; and the porters were at every gate: they didn`t need to depart from their service; for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt-offerings on the altar of Yahweh, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? [I come] not against you this day, but against the house with which I have war; and God has commanded me to make haste: forbear you from [meddling with] God, who is with me, that he not destroy you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and didn`t listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Yahweh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father`s place in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jehoiakim was Twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Yahweh to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">He also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of Yahweh which he had made holy in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yahweh, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Yahweh arose against his people, until there was no remedy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore he brought on them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or gray-headed: he gave them all into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">All the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Those who had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">to fulfill the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths: [for] as long as it lay desolate it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and [put it] also in writing, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth has Yahweh, the God of heaven, given me; and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, Yahweh his God be with him, and let him go up.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not appropriate for us to see the king`s dishonor, therefore have we sent and informed the king;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers: so shall you find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">We inform the king that, if this city be built, and the walls finished, by this means you shall have no portion beyond the River.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I sent them forth to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should tell Iddo, [and] his brothers the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">According to the good hand of our God on us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brothers, eighteen;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is on all those who seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all those who forsake him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So we fasted and begged our God for this: and he was entreated of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth [day] of the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the bandit by the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">We came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">The children of the captivity, who had come out of exile, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats for a sin-offering: all this was a burnt offering to Yahweh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when these things were done, the princes drew near to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, [doing] according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of them of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening offering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">At the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn; and I fell on my knees, and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and I said, my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you, my God; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up to the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty to this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now for a little moment grace has been showed from Yahweh our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we are bondservants; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the ruins of it, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now, our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken your commandments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which you go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">After all that is come on us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that you our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such a remnant,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">shall we again break your commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? would not you be angry with us until you had consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yahweh, the God of Israel, you are righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before you in our guiltiness; for none can stand before you because of this.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and [when] he came there, he ate no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, You have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand outside: neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all those who are in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges of it, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be dispatched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this [matter]: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The children of the captivity did so. Ezra the priest, [with] certain heads of fathers` [houses], after their fathers` houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been [before] sad in his presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The king said to me, Why is your face sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I said to the king, Let the king live forever: why should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers` tombs, lies waste, and the gates of it are consumed with fire?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the king said to me, For what do you make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I said to the king, If it please the king, and if your servant have found favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers` tombs, that I may build it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The king said to me (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall your journey be? and when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Moreover I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king`s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertains to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into.

      <VERS vnumber="12">I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any animal with me, except the animal that I rode on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal`s well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates of it were consumed with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then I went on to the spring gate and to the king`s pool: but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Then said I to them, You see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and the gates of it are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me, as also of the king`s words that he had spoken to me. They said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good [work].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you do? will you rebel against the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then answered I them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Hear, our God; for we are despised: and turn back their reproach on their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half [the height] of it: for the people had a mind to work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But it happened that when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very angry;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, until we come into the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It happened that when the Jews who lived by them came, they said to us ten times from all places, You must return to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set [there] the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Don`t be you afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, that we returned all of us to the wall, everyone to his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It happened from that time forth, that half of my servants worked in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They all built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work, and with the other held his weapon;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and the builders, everyone had his sword girded by his side, and so built. He who sounded the trumpet was by me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">in whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, resort you there to us; our God will fight for us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king`s tribute [on] our fields and our vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and, behold, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage [already]: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, You exact usury, everyone of his brother. I held a great assembly against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brothers the Jews, that were sold to the nations; and would you even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also I said, The thing that you do is not good: ought you not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I likewise, my brothers and my servants, do lend them money and grain. Please let us leave off this usury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Please restore to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you exact of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as you say. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that doesn`t perform this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. All the assembly said, Amen, and praised Yahweh. The people did according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the former governors who were before me were chargeable to the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants bore rule over the people: but I didn`t do so, because of the fear of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered there to the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, one hundred fifty men, besides those who came to us from among the nations that were round about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I didn`t demand the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy on this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Remember to me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it happened, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [one of] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I can`t come down: why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then sent Sanballat his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">in which was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause you are building the wall: and you would be their king, according to these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as you say, but you feign them out of your own heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it not be done. But now, [God], strengthen you my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to kill you; yes, in the night will they come to kill you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I discerned, and, behold, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty-two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It happened, when all our enemies heard [of it], that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it happened, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">I said to them, Don`t let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand [on guard], let them shut the doors, and bar you them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, and everyone [to be] over against his house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">yet you in your manifold mercies didn`t forsake them in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud didn`t depart from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn`t withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you did allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Their children also multiplied you as the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land concerning which you did say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their back, and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore left you them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times did you deliver them according to your mercies,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">Yet many years did you bear with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gave you them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keep covenant and lovingkindness, don`t let all the travail seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">However you are just in all that is come on us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">It came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">had prepared for him a great chamber, where before they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave-offerings for the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But in all this [time] I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">It grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute to their brothers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading donkeys [therewith]; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: and I testified [against them] in the day in which they sold victuals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There lived men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the Sabbath day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Didn`t your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this evil on us, and on this city? yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the Sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why lodge you about the wall? if you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember to me, my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your lovingkindness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In those days also saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews` language, but according to the language of each people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, my God, for good.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred twenty-seven provinces),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">in the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even one hundred eighty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast to all the people who were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king`s palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">[There were hangings of] white [cloth], [of] green, and [of] blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, and white, and yellow, and black marble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The drinking was according to the law; none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man`s pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven chamberlains who ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was beautiful to look on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king`s commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very angry, and his anger burned in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king`s manner toward all who knew law and judgment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king`s face, and sat first in the kingdom),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen has not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples who are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this deed of the queen will come abroad to all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn`t come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen say [the like] to all the king`s princes. So [will there arise] much contempt and wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it not be altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When the king`s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">for he sent letters into all the king`s provinces, into every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then said the king`s servants who ministered to him, Let there be beautiful young virgins sought for the king:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, to the custody of Hegai the king`s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. The thing pleased the king; and he did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He brought up Hadassah, who is, Esther, his uncle`s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So it happened, when the king`s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king`s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her things for her purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the king`s house: and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women`s house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, [to wit], six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">then in this wise came the maiden to the king: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king`s chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in to the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king`s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants, even Esther`s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king`s gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king`s gate, two of the king`s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those who kept the threshold, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it to Esther the queen; and Esther told the king [of it] in Mordecai`s name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">All the king`s servants, who were in the king`s gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn`t bow down, nor did him reverence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the king`s servants, who were in the king`s gate, said to Mordecai, Why disobey you the king`s commandment?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn`t listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai`s matters would stand: for he had told those who he was a Jew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Haman saw that Mordecai didn`t bow down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: why Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, [to] the twelfth [month], which is the month Adar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are diverse from [those of] every people; neither keep they the king`s laws: therefore it is not for the king`s profit to allow them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have the charge of the [king`s] business, to bring it into the king`s treasuries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews` enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The king said to Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then were the king`s scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day of it; and there was written according to all that Haman commanded to the king`s satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king`s ring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Letters were sent by posts into all the king`s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The posts went forth in haste by the king`s commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Esther`s maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent clothing to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he didn`t receive it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king`s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend on her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Hathach went forth to Mordecai to the broad place of the city, which was before the king`s gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king`s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai [saying]:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All the king`s servants, and the people of the king`s provinces, do know, that whoever, whether man or woman, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They told to Mordecai Esther`s words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Mordecai bade them return answer to Esther, Don`t think to yourself that you shall escape in the king`s house, more than all the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if you altogether hold your peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but you and your father`s house will perish: and who knows whether you haven`t come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Esther bade them return answer to Mordecai,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast you for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in to the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it happened on the third day, that Esther put on her royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king`s house, over against the king`s house: and the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the scepter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said the king to her, What will you, queen Esther? and what is your request? it shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Esther said, If it seem good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is your petition? and it shall be granted you: and what is your request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king`s gate, that he didn`t stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Haman said moreover, Yes, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow also am I invited by her together with the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king`s gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak you to the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go you in merrily with the king to the banquet. The thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On that night the king couldn`t sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king`s chamberlains, of those who kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">So Haman came in. The king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Haman said to the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head of which a crown royal is set:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the clothing and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king`s gate: let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then took Haman the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife to him, If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, you shall not prevail against him, but shall surely fall before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">While they were yet talking with him, came the king`s chamberlains, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Esther the queen answered, If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondservants and bondmaids, I had held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king`s damage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then spoke the king Ahasuerus and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that dared presume in his heart to do so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine [and went] into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen on the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king`s mouth, they covered Haman`s face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains who were before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, stands in the house of Haman. The king said, Hang him thereon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king`s wrath pacified.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews` enemy to Esther the queen. Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="18" bname="Job" bsname="Job">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she-donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts." Thus did Job continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now it happened on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan also came among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yahweh said to Satan, "Where have you come from?"     Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "Does Job fear God for nothing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Haven`t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Yahweh said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don`t put forth your hand."     So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother`s house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">that there came a messenger to Job, and said, "The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">While he was still speaking, there also came another, and said, "The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, "The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother`s house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He said, "Naked I came out of my mother`s womb, and naked shall I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be the name of Yahweh."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">In all this, Job did not sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again it happened on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has will he give for his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yahweh said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then his wife said to him, "Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?"     In all this Job didn`t sin with his lips.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when Job`s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn`t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">You asked, `Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?`    Therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand,    Things too wonderful for me, which I didn`t know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You said, `Listen, now, and I will speak;    I will question you, and you will answer me.`</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,    But now my eye sees you.</VERS>

They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money, and everyone a ring of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Turn at my reproof.    Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.    I will make known my words to you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">"Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher; "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Is there a thing of which it may be said, "Behold, this is new?" It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That which is crooked can`t be made straight; and that which is lacking can`t be counted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I said to myself, "Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with mirth: therefore enjoy pleasure;" and, behold, this also was vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I said of laughter, "It is foolishness;" and of mirth, "What does it accomplish?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold of folly, until I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I made myself great works. I built myself houses. I planted myself vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I made myself pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house. I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got myself men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men -- musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also remained with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Whatever my eyes desired, I didn`t keep from them. I didn`t withhold my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked, and at the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly: for what can the king`s successor do? Just that which has been done long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The wise man`s eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness -- and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then said I in my heart, "As it happens to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?" Then said I in my heart that this also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no memory for ever, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. Indeed, the wise man must die just like the fool!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who comes after me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge, and with skillfulness; yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not labored therein. This also is vanity and a great evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For what has a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, in which he labors under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For all his days are sorrows, and his travail is grief; yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For to the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh`s       house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall       be raised above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Many peoples shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up       to the mountain of Yahweh, to the house of the God of Jacob; and       he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for       out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Yahweh from       Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He will judge between the nations, and will       decide concerning many peoples; and they shall beat their swords       into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation       shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn       war any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">House of Jacob, come, and let us walk in the       light of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For you have forsaken your people the       house of Jacob, because they are filled [with customs] from the       east, and [are] soothsayers like the Philistines, and they clasp       hands with the children of foreigners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Their land is full       of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures;       their land also is full of horses, neither is there any end of       their chariots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Their land also is full of idols; they       worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers       have made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Man is bowed down, and mankind is humbled;       therefore don`t forgive them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">For there shall       be a day of Yahweh of Hosts on all that is proud and haughty, and       on all that is lifted up; and it shall be brought low;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and       on all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and on       all the oaks of Bashan,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Men shall go       into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth,       from before the terror of Yahweh, and from the glory of his       majesty, when he arises to shake mightily the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">In       that day men shall cast away their idols of silver, and their       idols of gold, which have been made for them to worship, to the       moles and to the bats;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">For, behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, does take away from       Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread,       and the whole stay of water;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">the mighty man, and the man of       war; the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">When a man shall take hold of his brother in the       house of his father, [saying], You have clothing, be you our       ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">in that day       shall he lift up [his voice], saying, I will not be a healer; for       in my house is neither bread nor clothing: you shall not make me       ruler of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is       fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh,       to provoke the eyes of his glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The show of their face       testifies against them. They declare their sin as Sodom. They       don`t hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have done evil to       themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Say you of the righteous, that [it shall be]       well [with him]; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">As for my       people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them.       My people, those who lead you cause you to err, and destroy the       way of your paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yahweh stands up to contend, and stands       to judge the peoples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Yahweh will enter into judgment with       the elders of his people, and the princes of it: It is you who       have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your       houses:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">what do you mean that you crush my people, and       grind the face of the poor? says the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and he dug it, and gathered out the stones of it, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, please judge between me and my vineyard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? why, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge of it, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the wall of it, and it shall be trodden down:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the vineyard of Yahweh of Hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness, but, behold, a cry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Woe to those who join house to house, who lay field to field, until there be no room, and you be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In my ears [says] Yahweh of Hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and beautiful, without inhabitant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield [but] an ephah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; who stay late into the night, until wine inflame them!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The harp and the lute, the tambourine and the pipe, and wine, are [in] their feasts; but they don`t regard the work of Yahweh, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend [into it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The mean man is bowed down, and the great man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">but Yahweh of Hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">who justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of Hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore is the anger of Yahweh kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has struck them; and the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the belt of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses` hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">their roaring shall be like a lioness, they shall roar like young lions; yes, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea: and if one look to the land, behold, darkness [and] distress; and the light is darkened in the clouds of it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">One cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but don`t understand; and see you indeed, but don`t perceive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said I, Lord, how long? He answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and Yahweh have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">If there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock of it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. His heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said Yahweh to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller`s field;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; don`t be afraid, neither let your heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have purposed evil against you, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">thus says the Lord Yahweh, It shall not stand, neither shall it happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty-five years shall Ephraim be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah`s son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Ask you a sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He said, "Listen now, house of David: Is it a small thing for you to weary men, that you will weary my God also?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Butter and honey shall he eat, when he knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">They shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all thorn-hedges, and on all pastures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">In that day will the Lord shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, [even] with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">It shall happen in that day, that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and it shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall everyone eat that is left in the midst of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It shall happen in that day, that every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver shekels, shall be for briers and thorns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">With arrows and with bow shall one come there, because all the land shall be briers and thorns.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">I went to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said Yahweh to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="36">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a great army. He stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller`s field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then came forth to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Rabshakeh said to them, Say you now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which you trust?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I say, [your] counsel and strength for the war are but vain words: now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Behold, you trust on the staff of this bruised reed, even on Egypt, whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if you tell me, We trust in Yahweh our God: isn`t that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now therefore, please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you be able on your part to set riders on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master`s servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Am I now come up without Yahweh against this land to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah to Rabshakeh, Please speak, to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and don`t speak to us in the Jews` language, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? [has he] not [sent me] to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews` language, and said, Hear you the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Thus says the king, Don`t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, Yahweh will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Don`t listen to Hezekiah: for thus says the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat you everyone of his vine, and everyone of his fig-tree, and drink you everyone the waters of his own cistern;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Yahweh will deliver us. Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king`s commandment was, saying, Don`t answer him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="37">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It happened, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard: why lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Isaiah said to them, Thus shall you tell your master, Thus says Yahweh, Don`t be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear news, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come out to fight against you. When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Don`t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shall you be delivered?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh, and spread it before Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, who sits [above] the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Turn your ear, Yahweh, and hear; open your eyes, Yahweh, and behold; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Of a truth, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men`s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh, even you only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Whom have you defied and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? [even] against the Holy One of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">By your servants have you defied the Lord, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars of it, and the choice fir-trees of it; and I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be your to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field [of grain] before it is grown up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance is come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This shall be the sign to you: you shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion those who shall escape. The zeal of Yahweh of Hosts will perform this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come to this city, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David`s sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The angel of Yahweh went forth, and struck in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">It happened, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar-haddon his son reigned in his place.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="38">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Set your house in order; for you shall die, and not live.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Hear you the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and say you to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man who doesn`t hear the words of this covenant,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall you be my people, and I will be your God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then answered I, and said, Amen, Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yahweh said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear you the words of this covenant, and do them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yet they didn`t obey, nor turn their ear, but walked everyone in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they didn`t do them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yahweh said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry to me, but I will not listen to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore don`t you pray for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What has my beloved to do in my house, seeing she has worked lewdness [with] many, and the holy flesh is passed from you? when you do evil, then you rejoice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yahweh called your name, A green olive-tree, beautiful with goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Yahweh of Hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have worked for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yahweh gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then you showed me their doings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I didn`t know that they had devised devices against me, [saying], Let us destroy the tree with the fruit of it, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But, Yahweh of Hosts, who judge righteously, who try the heart and the mind, I shall see your vengeance on them; for to you have I revealed my cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, You shall not prophesy in the name of Yahweh, that you not die by our hand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and there shall be no remnant to them: for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Righteous are you, Yahweh, when I contend with you; yet would I reason the cause with you: why does the way of the wicked prosper? why are all they at ease who deal very treacherously?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You have planted them, yes, they have taken root; they grow, yes, they bring forth fruit: you are near in their mouth, and far from their heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But you, Yahweh, know me; you see me, and try my heart toward you: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of those who dwell therein, the animals are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? and though in a land of peace you are secure, yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; even they have cried aloud after you: don`t believe them, though they speak beautiful words to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">My heritage is become to me as a lion in the forest: she has uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her round about? go you, assemble all the animals of the field, bring them to devour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They have made it a desolation; it mourns to me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man lays it to heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Destroyers are come on all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh has peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Thus says Yahweh against all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It shall happen, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It shall happen, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Yahweh lives; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, says Yahweh.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Thus says Yahweh to me, Go, and buy you a linen belt, and put it on your loins, and don`t put it in water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So I bought a belt according to the word of Yahweh, and put it on my loins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The word of Yahweh came to me the second time, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Take the belt that you have bought, which is on your loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Yahweh commanded me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It happened after many days, that Yahweh said to me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the belt from there, which I commanded you to hide there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the belt from the place where I had hid it; and, behold, the belt was marred, it was profitable for nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Thus says Yahweh, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this belt, which is profitable for nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For as the belt cleaves to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, says Yahweh; that they may be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore you shall speak to them this word: Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall tell you, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then shall you tell them, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit on David`s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says Yahweh: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Hear you, and give ear; don`t be proud; for Yahweh has spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Give glory to Yahweh your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and, while you look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for [your] pride; and my eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because Yahweh`s flock is taken captive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Say you to the king and to the queen-mother, Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headdresses are come down, even the crown of your glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive, all of it; it is wholly carried away captive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Lift up your eyes, and see those who come from the north: where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">What will you say, when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you? shall not sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">If you say in your heart, Why are these things come on me? for the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered, and your heels suffer violence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may you also do good, who are accustomed to do evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passes away, by the wind of the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This is your lot, the portion measured to you from me, says Yahweh; because you have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore will I also uncover your skirts on your face, and your shame shall appear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries, and your neighing, the lewdness of your prostitution, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, Jerusalem! you will not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Judah mourns, and the gates of it languish, they sit in black on the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are put to shame and confounded, and cover their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Because of the ground which is cracked, because no rain has been in the land, the plowmen are put to shame, they cover their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Yes, the hind also in the field calves, and forsakes [her young], because there is no grass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Though our iniquities testify against us, work you for your name`s sake, Yahweh; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You hope of Israel, the Savior of it in the time of trouble, why should you be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Why should you be like a scared man, as a mighty man who can`t save? yet you, Yahweh, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; don`t leave us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus says Yahweh to this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore Yahweh does not accept them; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yahweh said to me, Don`t pray for this people for [their] good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh! behold, the prophets tell them, You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Yahweh said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I didn`t send them, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke I to them: they prophesy to you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their own heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, and I didn`t send them, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them-them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You shall say this word to them, Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, those who are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Have you utterly rejected Judah? has your soul loathed Zion? why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We acknowledge, Yahweh, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Do not abhor [us], for your name`s sake; do not disgrace the throne of your glory: remember, don`t break your covenant with us.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then said Yahweh to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind would not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It shall happen, when they tell you, Where shall we go forth? then you shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I will appoint over them four kinds, says Yahweh: the sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of the sky, and the animals of the earth, to devour and to destroy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I will cause them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? or who will bemoan you? or who will turn aside to ask of your welfare?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You have rejected me, says Yahweh, you are gone backward: therefore have I stretched out my hand against you, and destroyed you; I am weary with repenting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land; I have bereaved [them] of children, I have destroyed my people; they didn`t return from their ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday: I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on her suddenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">She who has borne seven languishes; she has given up the spirit; her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she has been put to shame and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, neither have men lent to me; [yet] everyone of them does curse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yahweh said, Most assuredly I will strengthen you for good; most assuredly I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Your substance and your treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I will make [them] to pass with your enemies into a land which you don`t know; for a fire is kindled in my anger, which shall burn on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yahweh, you know; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; don`t take me away in your longsuffering: know that for your sake I have suffered reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Your words were found, and I ate them; and your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, Yahweh, God of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I didn`t sit in the assembly of those who make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of your hand; for you have filled me with indignation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? will you indeed be to me as a deceitful [brook], as waters that fail?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore thus says Yahweh, If you return, then will I bring you again, that you may stand before me; and if you take forth the precious from the vile, you shall be as my mouth: they shall return to you, but you shall not return to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I will make you to this people a fortified brazen wall; and they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, says Yahweh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Yahweh came also to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You shall not take a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters, in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For thus says Yahweh concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bore them, and concerning their fathers who became the father of them in this land:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They shall die grievous deaths: they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung on the surface of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For thus says Yahweh, Don`t enter into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for I have taken away my peace from this people, says Yahweh, even lovingkindness and tender mercies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">neither shall men break [bread] for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">It shall happen, when you shall show this people all these words, and they shall tell you, Why has Yahweh pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then shall you tell them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, says Yahweh, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and you have done evil more than your fathers; for, behold, you walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that you don`t listen to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that you have not known, neither you nor your fathers; and there shall you serve other gods day and night; for I will show you no favor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that it shall no more be said, As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">First I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yahweh, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, [even] vanity and things in which there is no profit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Shall a man make to himself gods, which yet are no gods?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus speaks Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Write you all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, says Yahweh; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For thus says Yahweh: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Ask you now, and see whether a man does travail with child: why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob`s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It shall come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondservant;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">but they shall serve Yahweh their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore don`t you be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh; neither be dismayed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not make a full end of you; but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For thus says Yahweh, Your hurt is incurable, and your wound grievous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">All your lovers have forgotten you; they don`t seek you: for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Why cry you for your hurt? your pain is incurable: for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, everyone of them, shall go into captivity; and those who despoil you shall be a spoil, and all who prey on you will I give for a prey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says Yahweh; because they have called you an outcast, [saying], It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thus says Yahweh: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob`s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be built on its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Their children also shall be as before, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all who oppress them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who is he who has had boldness to approach to me? says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You shall be my people, and I will be your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Behold, the tempest of Yahweh, [even his] wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst on the head of the wicked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The fierce anger of Yahweh shall not return, until he has executed, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you shall understand it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="31">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time, says Yahweh, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus says Yahweh, The people who were left of the sword found favor in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yahweh appeared of old to me, [saying], Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Again will I build you, and you shall be built, O virgin of Israel: again shall you be adorned with your tambourines, and shall go forth in the dances of those who make merry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Again shall you plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy [the fruit of it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For there shall be a day, that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise you, and let us go up to Zion to Yahweh our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For thus says Yahweh, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout for the chief of the nations: publish you, praise you, and say, Yahweh, save your people, the remnant of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, [and] with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her who travails with child together: a great company shall they return here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They shall come with weeping; and with petitions will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way in which they shall not stumble; for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Hear the word of Yahweh, you nations, and declare it in the isles afar off; and say, He who scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as shepherd does his flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow to the goodness of Yahweh, to the grain, and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Thus says Yahweh: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Thus says Yahweh: Refrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears; for your work shall be rewarded, says Yahweh; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">There is hope for your latter end, says Yahweh; and [your] children shall come again to their own border.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself [thus], You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a calf unaccustomed [to the yoke]: turn you me, and I shall be turned; for you are Yahweh my God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I struck on my thigh: I was ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Set up road signs, make guideposts; set your heart toward the highway, even the way by which you went: turn again, virgin of Israel, turn again to these your cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">How long will you go here and there, you backsliding daughter? for Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall encompass a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Thus says Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities of it, when I shall bring again their captivity: Yahweh bless you, habitation of righteousness, mountain of holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Judah and all the cities of it shall dwell therein together, the farmers, and those who go about with flocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">On this I awakened, and saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of animal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">It shall happen that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children`s teeth are set on edge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But everyone shall die for his own iniquity: every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke, although I was a husband to them, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says Yahweh: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Yahweh; for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Yahweh: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Thus says Yahweh, who gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea, so that the waves of it roar; Yahweh of hosts is his name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">If these ordinances depart from before me, says Yahweh, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Thus says Yahweh: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that the city shall be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The measuring line shall go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and shall turn about to Goah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy to Yahweh; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more forever.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="32">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now at that time the king of Babylon`s army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah`s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy, and say, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, says Yahweh: though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jeremiah said, The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, Buy you my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is your to buy it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Hanamel my uncle`s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Yahweh, and said to me, Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is your, and the redemption is your; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle`s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, [according to] the law and custom, and that which was open:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle`s [son], and in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I charged Baruch before them, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Thus says Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For thus says Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Ah Lord Yahweh! behold, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">who show lovingkindness to thousands, and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, Yahweh of Hosts is his name;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">who did set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and among [other] men; and mad you a name, as at this day;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and did bring forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and gave them this land, which you did swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and they came in, and possessed it, but they didn`t obey your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do: therefore you have caused all this evil to come on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Behold, the mounds, they are come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what you have spoken is happen; and, behold, you see it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">You have said to me, Lord Yahweh, Buy you the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Behold, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore thus says Yahweh: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and the Chaldeans, who fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink-offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">They have turned to me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [the fire] to Molech; which I didn`t command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Now therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof you say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For thus says Yahweh: Like as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so will I bring on them all the good that I have promised them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Fields shall be bought in this land, whereof you say, It is desolate, without man or animal; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, says Yahweh.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="33">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus says Yahweh who does it, Yahweh who forms it to establish it; Yahweh is his name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great things, and difficult, which you don`t know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down [to make a defense] against the mounds and against the sword;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">while [men] come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and whereby they have transgressed against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">[This city] shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus says Yahweh: Yet again there shall be heard in this place, whereof you say, It is waste, without man and without animal, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without animal,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, Give thanks to Yahweh of Hosts, for Yahweh is good, for his lovingkindness endures forever; [and of them] who bring [sacrifices of] thanksgiving into the house of Yahweh. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without animal, and in all the cities of it, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is [the name] whereby she shall be called: Yahweh our righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For thus says Yahweh: David shall never want a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to burn meal-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thus says Yahweh: If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there shall not be day and night in their season;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">As the host of the sky can`t be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites who minister to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Don`t you consider what this people has spoken, saying, The two families which Yahweh did choose, he has cast them off? thus do they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thus says Yahweh: If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="34">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of it, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and your eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yet hear the word of Yahweh, O Zedekiah king of Judah: thus says Yahweh concerning you, You shall not die by the sword;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">you shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so shall they make a burning for you; and they shall lament you, [saying], Ah Lord! for I have spoken the word, says Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">when the king of Babylon`s army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these [alone] remained of the cities of Judah [as] fortified cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">that every man should let his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that none should make bondservants of them, [to wit], of a Jew his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">All the princes and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his man-servant, and everyone his maid-servant, go free, that none should make bondservants of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says Yahweh, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord Yahweh lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because       of great servitude; She dwells among the nations, she finds no rest: All her persecutors overtook her within the straits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn       assembly; All her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh: Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper; For Yahweh has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">From the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed: Her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, They are gone without strength before the pursuer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her       miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old: When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help       her, The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an       unclean thing; All who honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: Yes, she sighs, and turns backward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Her filthiness was in her skirts; she didn`t remember her latter       end; Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she has no comforter: See, Yahweh, my affliction; for the enemy has magnified himself.</VERS>
