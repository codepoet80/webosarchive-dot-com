    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the thirde yeere of the reigne of Iehoiakim king of Iudah, came Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel vnto Ierusalem and besieged it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And ye Lord gaue Iehoiakim king of Iudah into his hand; with parte of the vessels of the house of God, which he caryed into the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into his gods treasurie.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the King spake vnto Ashpenaz the master of his Eunuches, that he shoulde bring certeine of the children of Israel, of the Kings seede, and of the princes:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Children in whome was no blemish, but well fauoured, and instruct in all wisedome, and well seene in knowledge, and able to vtter knowledge, and such as were able to stande in the kings palace, and whome they might teach the learning, and the tongue of the Caldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the King appointed them prouision euery day of a portion of the Kings meate, and and of the wine, which he dranke, so nourishing them three yeere, that at the ende thereof, they might stande before the King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Nowe among these were certeine of the children of Iudah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Vnto whome the chiefe of the Eunuches gaue other names: for hee called Daniel, Belteshazzar, and Hananiah, Shadrach, and Mishael, Meshach, and Azariah, Abednego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Daniel had determined in his heart, that hee woulde not defile him selfe with the portion of the Kings meate, nor with the wine which he dranke: therefore he required the chiefe of the Eunuches that he might not defile himselfe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">(Nowe God had brought Daniel into fauour, and tender loue with the chiefe of the Eunuches)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the chiefe of the Eunuches sayd vnto Daniel, I feare my lord the King, who hath appointed your meate and your drinke: therefore if he see your faces worse liking then the other children, which are of your sort, then shall you make me lose mine head vnto the King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then sayd Daniel to Melzar, whome the chiefe of the Eunuches had set ouer Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Proue thy seruants, I beseeche thee, ten dayes, and let them giue vs pulse to eate, and water to drinke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then let our countenances bee looked vpon before thee, and the countenances of the children that eate of the portion of the Kings meate: and as thou seest, deale with thy seruantes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So hee consented to them in this matter, an proued them ten dayes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And at the end of ten dayes, their countenances appeared fayrer, and in better liking then all the childrens, which did eate the portion of the Kings meate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Thus Melzar tooke away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drinke, and gaue them pulse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">As for these foure children, God gaue them knowledge, and vnderstanding in al learning and wisedome: also he gaue Daniel vnderstanding of all visions and dreames.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Nowe when the time was expired, that the King had appoynted to bring them in, the chiefe of the Eunuches brought them before Nebuchad-nezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the King communed with them: and among them al was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stoode they before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And in all matters of wisedome, and vnderstanding that the King enquired of them, hee founde them tenne times better then all the inchanters and astrologians, that were in all his realme.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Daniel was vnto the first yeere of king Cyrus.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And in the seconde yeere of the raygne of Nebuchad-nezzar, Nebuchad-nezzar dreamed dreames wherewith his spirite was troubled, and his sleepe was vpon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the King commanded to call the inchanters, and the astrologians and the sorcerers, and the Caldeans for to shewe the King his dreames: so they came and stoode before the King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the King sayde vnto them, I haue dreamed a dreame, and my spirite was troubled to knowe the dreame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then spake the Caldeans to the King in the Aramites language, O King, liue for euer: shewe thy seruants thy dreame, and wee shall shewe the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the King answered and sayd to the Caldeans, The thing is gone from me. If ye will not make me vnderstande the dreame with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be drawen in pieces, and your houses shall be made a iakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if yee declare the dreame and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receyue of me gifts and rewardes, and great honour: therefore shewe me the dreame and the interpretation of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They answered againe, and sayde, Let the King shewe his seruantes the dreame, and wee will declare the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the King answered, and sayd, I knowe certeinly that ye would gaine the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if ye will not declare mee the dreame, there is but one iudgement for you: for ye haue prepared lying and corrupt wordes, to speake before me till the time bee changed: therefore tell me the dreame, that I may knowe, if yee can declare me the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the Caldeans answered before the King, and sayde, There is no man vpon earth that can declare the Kings matter: yea, there is neither king nor prince nor lorde that asked such things at an inchanter or astrologian or Caldean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For it is a rare thing that the King requireth, and there is none other that can declare it before the King, except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For this cause the king was angrie and in great furie, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when sentence was giuen, the wise men were slayne: and they sought Daniel and his fellowes to be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisedome to Arioch the Kings chiefe stewarde, which was gone foorth to put to death the wise men of Babel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yea, he answered and sayde vnto Arioch the kings captaine, Why is the sentence so hastie from the king? Then Arioch declared the thing to Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Daniel went and desired the king that he woulde giue him leasure and that he woulde shewe the king the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The Daniel went to his house and shewed the matter to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah his companions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">That they should beseech the God of heauen for grace in this secrete, that Daniel and his fellowes should not perish with the rest of ye wise men of Babel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was the secret reueiled vnto Daniel in a vision by night: therefore Daniel praysed the God of heauen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Daniel answered and sayde, The Name of God be praysed for euer and euer: for wisedome and strength are his,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And hee changeth the times and seasons: he taketh away kings: he setteth vp kings: he giueth wisedome vnto the wise, and vnderstanding to those that vnderstand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Hee discouereth the deepe and secrete things: he knoweth what is in darkenes, and the light dwelleth with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I thanke thee and prayse thee, O thou God of my fathers, that thou hast giuen mee wisedome and strength, and hast shewed me nowe the thing that wee desired of thee: for thou hast declared vnto vs the kings matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore Daniel went vnto Arioch, whome the King had ordeyned to destroy the wise men of Babel: he went and sayde thus vnto him, Destroy not the wise men of Babel, but bring me before the King, and I will declare vnto the King the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Arioch brought Daniel before the King in all haste, and sayd thus vnto him, I haue found a man of the children of Iudah that were brought captiues, that will declare vnto the King the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then answered the King, and sayde vnto Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to shew me the dreame, which I haue seene, and the interpretation thereof?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Daniel answered in the presence of the King, and sayd, The secret which the King hath demanded, can neither the wise, the astrologians, the inchanters, nor the southsayers declare vnto the King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But there is a God in heauen that reueileth secrets, and sheweth the King Nebuchad-nezzar what shall bee in the latter dayes. Thy dreame, and the things which thou hast seene in thine heade vpon thy bed, is this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">O King, when thou wast in thy bedde, thoughts came into thy mind, what should come to passe hereafter, and he that reueyleth secretes, telleth thee, what shall come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">As for me, this secret is not shewed mee for any wisedome that I haue, more then any other liuing, but onely to shewe the King the interpretation, and that thou mightest knowe the thoughts of thine heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">O King, thou sawest, and beholde, there was a great image: this great image whose glory was so excellent, stood before thee, and the forme thereof was terrible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This images head was of fine golde, his breast and his armes of siluer, his bellie and his thighs of brasse,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">His legges of yron, and his feete were part of yron, and part of clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Thou beheldest it til a stone was cut without hands, which smote the image vpon his feete, that were of yron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then was the yron, the clay, the brasse, the siluer and the golde broken all together, and became like the chaffe of the sommer floures, and the winde caryed them away, that no place was founde for them: and the stone that smote the image, became a great mountaine, and filled the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This is the dreame, and we will declare before the King the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">O King, thou art a king of Kings: for the God of heauen hath giuen thee a kingdome, power, and strength, and glorie.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And in all places where the children of men dwell, the beasts of the fielde, and the foules of the heauen hath he giuen into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler ouer them al: thou art this heade of golde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And after thee shall rise another kingdome, inferiour to thee, of siluer, and another third kingdome shalbe of brasse, which shall beare rule ouer all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And the fourth kingdome shall be strong as yron: for as yron breaketh in pieces, and subdueth all things, and as yron bruiseth all these things, so shall it breake in pieces, and bruise all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Where as thou sawest the feete and toes, parte of potters clay, and part of yron: the kingdome shalbe deuided, but there shalbe in it of the strength of the yron, as thou sawest the yron mixt with the clay, and earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And as the toes of the feete were parte of yron, and parte of clay, so shall the kingdome be partly strong, and partly broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And where as thou sawest yron mixt with clay and earth, they shall mingle themselues with the seede of men: but they shall not ioyne one with another, as yron can not bee mixed with clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And in the dayes of these Kings, shall the God of heauen set vp a kingdome, which shall neuer be destroyed: and this kingdome shall not be giuen to another people, but it shall breake, and destroy al these kingdomes, and it shall stand for euer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Where as thou sawest, that the stone was cut of the mountaine without handes, and that it brake in pieces the yron, the brasse, the clay, the siluer, and the golde: so the great God hath shewed the King, what shall come to passe hereafter, and the dreame is true, and the interpretation thereof is sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then the King Nebuchad-nezzar fell vpon his face, and bowed himselfe vnto Daniel, and commanded that they should offer meate offrings, and sweete odours vnto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Also the King answered vnto Daniel, and said, I know of a trueth that your God is a God of gods, and the Lord of Kings, and the reueiler of secrets, seeing thou couldest open this secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">So the King made Daniel a great man, and gaue him many and great giftes. Hee made him gouernour ouer the whole prouince of Babel, and chiefe of the rulers, and aboue all the wise men of Babel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Then Daniel made request to the King, and hee set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego ouer the charge of the prouince of Babel: but Daniel sate in the gate of the King.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Nebuchad-nezzar the King made an image of gold, whose height was three score cubits, and the breadth thereof sixe cubites: hee set it vp in the plaine of Dura, in the prouince of Babel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Nebuchad-nezzar ye King sent foorth to gather together the nobles, the princes and the dukes, the iudges, the receiuers, the counsellers, the officers, and all the gouernours of the prouinces, that they should come to the dedication of the image, which Nebuchad-nezzar the King had set vp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So the nobles, princes and dukes, the iudges, the receiuers, the counsellers, the officers, and all the gouernours of the prouinces were assembled vnto the dedicating of the image, that Nebuchad-nezzar the King had set vp: and they stood before the image, which Nebuchad-nezzar had set vp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then an herald cried aloude, Be it knowen to you, O people, nations, and languages,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That when ye heare the sound of the cornet, trumpet, harpe, sackebut, psalterie, dulcimer, and all instruments of musike, ye fall downe and worship the golden image, that Nebuchad-nezzar the King hath set vp,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And whosoeuer falleth not downe and worshippeth, shall the same houre bee cast into the middes of an hote fierie fornace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore assoone as all the people heard the sound of the cornet, trumpet, harpe, sackebut, psalterie, and all instruments of musike, all the people, nations, and languages fell downe, and worshipped the golden image, that Nebuchad-nezzar the King had set vp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">By reason whereof at that same time came men of the Caldeans, and grieuously accused the Iewes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they spake and said to the King Nebuchad-nezzar, O King, liue for euer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thou, O King, hast made a decree, that euery man that shall heare the sounde of the cornet, trumpet, harpe, sackebut, psalterie, and dulcimer, and all instruments of musike, shall fall downe and worship the golden image,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And whosoeuer falleth not downe, and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the mids of an hote fierie fornace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There are certeine Iewes whome thou hast set ouer the charge of ye prouince of Babel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: these men, O King, haue not regarded thy commandement, neither wil they serue thy gods, nor worship the golden image, that thou hast set vp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Nebuchad-nezzar in his anger and wrath commanded that they should bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: so these men were brought before the King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Nebuchad-nezzar spake, and said vnto them, What disorder? will not you, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego serue my god, nor worship the golden image, that I haue set vp?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore are ye ready when ye heare the sound of the cornet, trumpet, harpe, sackebut, psalterie, and dulcimer, and all instruments of musike, to fall downe, and worship the image, which I haue made? for if ye worship it not, ye shall be cast immediatly into the middes of an hote fierie fornace: for who is that God, that can deliuer you out of mine handes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the King, O Nebuchad-nezzar, we are not carefull to answere thee in this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Beholde, our God whom we serue, is able to deliuer vs from the hote fierie fornace, and hee will deliuer vs out of thine hand, O King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if not, bee it knowen to thee, O King, that wee will not serue thy gods, nor worship the golden image, which thou hast set vp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was Nebuchad-nezzar full of rage, and the forme of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore hee charged and commanded that they should heate the fornace at once seuen times more then it was wont to be heat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And hee charged the most valiant men of warre that were in his armie, to binde Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the hote fierie fornace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So these men were bounde in their coates, their hosen, and their clokes, with their other garments, and cast into the middes of the hote fierie fornace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore, because the Kings commandement was straite, that the fornace should be exceeding hote, the flame of the fire slew those men that brought foorth Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And these three men Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego fell downe bound into the middes of the hote fierie fornace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Nebuchad-nezzar the King was astonied and rose vp in haste, and spake, and saide vnto his counsellers, Did not wee cast three men bound into the middes of the fire? Who answered and said vnto the King, It is true, O King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he answered, and said, Loe, I see foure men loose, walking in the middes of the fire, and they haue no hurt, and the forme of the fourth is like the sonne of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then the King Nebuchad-nezzar came neere to the mouth of the hote fierie fornace, and spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, the seruants of the hie God goe foorth and come hither: so Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came foorth of the middes of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the nobles, princes and dukes, and the Kings counsellers came together to see these men, because the fire had no power ouer their bodies: for not an heare of their head was burnt, neither was their coates changed, nor any smelll of fire came vpon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Wherefore Nebuchad-nezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who hath sent his Angel, and deliuered his seruants, that put their trust in him, and haue changed the Kings commandement, and yeelded their bodies rather then they would serue or worship any god, saue their owne God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore I make a decree, that euery people, nation, and language, which speake any blasphemie against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, shalbe drawen in pieces, and their houses shall be made a iakes, because there is no god that can deliuer after this sort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the King promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the prouince of Babel. [ (Daniel 3:31) Nebuchad-nezzar King vnto all people, nations and languages, that dwell in all the world, Peace be multiplied vnto you: ] [ (Daniel 3:32) I thought it good to declare the signes and wonders, that the hie God hath wrought toward me. ] [ (Daniel 3:33) How great are his signes, and how mightie are his wonders! his kingdome is an euerlasting kingdome, and his dominion is from generation to generation. ]</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I Nebuchad-nezzar being at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Saw a dreame, which made me afraide, and the thoughtes vpon my bed, and the visions of mine head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore made I a decree, that they should bring all the wise men of Babel before mee, that they might declare vnto me the interpretation of the dreame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So came the inchanters, the astrologians, the Caldeans and the sothsayers, to whom I tolde the dreame, but they could not shew me the interpretation thereof,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Till at the last Daniel came before mee, (whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, which hath the spirite of the holy gods in him) and before him I tolde the dreame, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">O Belteshazzar, chiefe of the enchanters, because I know, that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell mee the visions of my dreame, that I haue seene and the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed. And beholde, I sawe a tree in the middes of the earth and the height thereof was great:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">A great tree and strong, and the height thereof reached vnto heauen, and the sight thereof to the endes of all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The boughes thereof were faire and the fruite thereof much, and in it was meate for all: it made a shadow vnder it for the beastes of the fielde, and the foules of the heauen dwelt in the boughes thereof, and all flesh fedde of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I sawe in the visions of mine head vpon my bed, and beholde, a watchman and an holy one came downe from heauen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And cried aloude, and said thus, Hew downe the tree, and breake off his branches: shake off his leaues, and scatter his fruite, that the beastes may flee from vnder it, and the foules from his branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Neuerthelesse leaue the stumpe of his rootes in the earth, and with a band of yron and brasse binde it among the grasse of the fielde, and let it be wet with the dewe of heauen, and let his portion be with the beastes among the grasse of the fielde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Let his heart be changed from mans nature, and let a beasts heart be giuen vnto him, and let seuen times be passed ouer him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The sentence is according to the decree of the watchmen, and according to the word of the holy ones: the demaunde was answered, to the intent that liuing men may knowe, that the most High hath power ouer the kingdome of men, and giueth it to whomsoeuer he will, and appointeth ouer it the most abiect among men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">This is the dreame, that I King Nebuchad-nezzar haue seene: therefore thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof: for all the wisemen of my kingdome are not able to shewe mee the interpretation: but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Daniel (whose name was Belteshazzar) held his peace by the space of one houre, and his thoughts troubled him, and the King spake and said, Belteshazzar, let neither the dreame, nor the interpretation thereof trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and saide, My lord, the dreame be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The tree that thou sawest, which was great and mightie, whose height reached vnto the heauen, and the sight thereof through all the world,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whose leaues were faire and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meate for all, vnder the which the beastes of the fielde dwelt, and vpon whose branches the foules of the heauen did sit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It is thou, O King, that art great and mightie: for thy greatnesse is growen, and reacheth vnto heauen, and thy dominion to the endes of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Where as the King sawe a watchman, and an holy one, that came downe from heauen, and said, Hew downe the tree and destroy it, yet leaue the stumpe of the rootes thereof in the earth, and with a bande of yron and brasse binde it among the grasse of the fielde, and let it be wette with the dewe of heauen, and let his portion be with the beastes of the fielde, till seuen times passe ouer him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">This is the interpretation, O King, and it is the decree of the most High, which is come vpon my lord the King,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">That they shall driue thee from men, and thy dwelling shalbe with the beasts of the fielde: they shall make thee to eate grasse as the oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dewe of heauen: and seuen times shall passe ouer thee, till thou knowe, that the most High beareth rule ouer the kingdome of men, and giueth it to whom so euer he will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Where as they sayd, that one should leaue the stumpe of the tree rootes, thy kingdome shall remaine vnto thee: after that, thou shalt knowe, that the heauens haue the rule.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Wherefore, O King, let my counsell be acceptable vnto thee, and breake off thy sinnes by righteousnes, and thine iniquities by mercy toward the poore: lo, let there be an healing of thine errour.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Why do thy disciples transgresse the tradition of the Elders? for they wash not their hands when they eate bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But he answered and said vnto them, Why doe yee also transgresse the commandement of God by your tradition?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For God hath commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and he that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But ye say, Whosoeuer shall say to father or mother, By the gift that is offered by me, thou maiest haue profite,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Though hee honour not his father, or his mother, shalbe free: thus haue ye made the commandement of God of no aucthoritie by your tradition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">O hypocrites, Esaias prophecied well of you, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This people draweth neere vnto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with the lips, but their heart is farre off from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But in vaine they worship me, teaching for doctrines, mens precepts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then hee called the multitude vnto him, and said to them, Heare and vnderstand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">That which goeth into the mouth, defileth not the man, but that which commeth out of the mouth, that defileth the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then came his disciples, and saide vnto him, Perceiuest thou not, that the Pharises are offended in hearing this saying?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But hee answered and saide, Euery plant which mine heauenly Father hath not planted, shalbe rooted vp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let them alone, they be the blinde leaders of the blinde: and if the blinde leade ye blinde, both shall fall into the ditche.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then answered Peter, and said to him, Declare vnto vs this parable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then said Iesus, Are ye yet without vnderstanding?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Perceiue ye not yet, that whatsoeuer entreth into the mouth, goeth into the bellie, and is cast out into the draught?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But those thinges which proceede out of the mouth, come from the heart, and they defile the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For out of the heart come euil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, slaunders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">These are the things, which defile the man: but to eat with vnwashen hands, defileth not ye man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Iesus went thence, and departed into the coastes of Tyrus and Sidon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And beholde, a woman a Cananite came out of the same coasts, and cried, saying vnto him, Haue mercie on me, O Lord, the sonne of Dauid: my daughter is miserably vexed with a deuil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But hee answered her not a worde. Then came to him his disciples, and besought him, saying, Sende her away, for she crieth after vs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But he answered, and said, I am not sent, but vnto the lost sheepe of the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Yet she came, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, helpe me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he answered, and said, It is not good to take the childrens bread, and to cast it to whelps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But she said, Trueth, Lord: yet in deede the whelpes eate of the crommes, which fall from their masters table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Iesus answered, and saide vnto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it to thee, as thou desirest. And her daughter was made whole at that houre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So Iesus went away from thence, and came neere vnto the sea of Galile, and went vp into a mountaine and sate downe there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And great multitudes came vnto him, hauing with them, halt, blinde, dumme, maymed, and many other, and cast them downe at Iesus feete, and he healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">In so much that the multitude wondered, to see the dumme speake, the maimed whole, the halt to goe, and the blinde to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then Iesus called his disciples vnto him, and said, I haue compassion on this multitude, because they haue continued with mee already three dayes, and haue nothing to eate: and I wil not let them depart fasting, least they faint in the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And his disciples saide vnto him, Whence should we get so much bread in the wildernes, as should suffice so great a multitude!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Iesus said vnto them, How many loaues haue ye? And they said, Seuen, and a few litle fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then he commanded the multitude to sit downe on the ground,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And tooke the seuen loaues, and the fishes, and gaue thankes, and brake them, and gaue to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And they did all eate, and were sufficed: and they tooke vp of the fragments that remained, seuen baskets full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And they that had eaten, were foure thousand men, beside women, and litle children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then Iesus sent away the multitude, and tooke ship, and came into the partes of Magdala.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came the Pharises and Sadduces, and did tempt him, desiring him to shew them a signe from heauen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But he answered, and said vnto them, When it is euening, ye say, Faire wether: for ye skie is red.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in the morning ye say, To day shall be a tempest: for the skie is red and lowring. O hypocrites, ye can discerne the face of the skie, and can ye not discerne the signes of the times?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The wicked generation, and adulterous seeketh a signe, but there shall no signe be giuen it, but that signe of the Prophet Ionas: so hee left them, and departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Iesus said vnto them, Take heede and beware of the leauen of the Pharises and Sadduces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they reasoned among themselues, saying, It is because we haue brought no bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Iesus knowing it, saide vnto them, O ye of litle faith, why reason you thus among your selues, because ye haue brought no bread?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Doe ye not yet perceiue, neither remember the fiue loaues, when there were fiue thousand men, and how many baskets tooke ye vp?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Neither the seuen loaues when there were foure thousande men, and howe many baskets tooke ye vp?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Why perceiue ye not that I said not vnto you concerning bread, that ye shoulde beware of the leauen of the Pharises and Sadduces?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then vnderstood they that he had not said that they should beware of the leauen of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharises, and Sadduces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Nowe when Iesus came into the coastes of Cesarea Philippi, hee asked his disciples, saying, Whome doe men say that I, the sonne of man am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they said, Some say, Iohn Baptist: and some, Elias: and others, Ieremias, or one of the Prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said vnto them, But whome say ye that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Simon Peter answered, and said, Thou art that Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Iesus answered, and saide to him, Blessed art thou, Simon, the sonne of Ionas: for flesh and blood hath not reueiled it vnto thee, but my Father which is in heauen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I say also vnto thee, that thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke I will builde my Church: and ye gates of hell shall not ouercome it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt binde vpon earth, shalbe bound in heauen: and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heauen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then hee charged his disciples, that they should tell no man that he was Iesus that Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">From that time foorth Iesus beganne to shewe vnto his disciples, that he must goe vnto Hierusalem, and suffer many thinges of the Elders, and of the hie Priestes, and Scribes, and be slaine, and be raised againe the thirde day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Peter tooke him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, Master, pitie thy selfe: this shall not be vnto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then he turned backe, and said vnto Peter, Get thee behinde me, Satan: thou art an offence vnto me, because thou vnderstandest not the thinges that are of God, but the thinges that are of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Iesus then saide to his disciples, If any man will follow me, let him forsake himselfe: and take vp his crosse, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For whosoeuer will saue his life, shall lose it: and whosoeuer shall lose his life for my sake, shall finde it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For what shall it profite a man though he should winne the whole worlde, if hee lose his owne soule? or what shall a man giue for recompence of his soule?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the Sonne of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his Angels, and then shall he giue to euery man according to his deedes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Verely I say vnto you, there bee some of them that stande here, which shall not taste of death, till they haue seene the Sonne of man come in his kingdome.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after sixe dayes, Iesus tooke Peter, and Iames and Iohn his brother, and brought them vp into an hie mountaine apart,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the Sunne, and his clothes were as white as the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And beholde, there appeared vnto them Moses, and Elias, talking with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then answered Peter, and saide to Iesus, Master, it is good for vs to be here: if thou wilt, let vs make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloude shadowed them: and beholde, there came a voyce out of the cloude, saying, This is that my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased: heare him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the disciples heard that, they fell on their faces, and were sore afraide.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Iesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraide.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when they lifted vp their eyes, they sawe no man, saue Iesus onely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And as they came downe from the moutaine, Iesus charged them, saying, Shewe the vision to no man, vntil the Sonne of man rise againe from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the Scribes that Elias must first come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, Certeinely Elias must first come, and restore all thinges.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But I say vnto you that Elias is come alreadie, and they knewe him not, but haue done vnto him whatsoeuer they would: likewise shall also the Sonne of man suffer of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the disciples perceiued that he spake vnto them of Iohn Baptist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certaine man, and fell downe at his feete,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And saide, Master, haue pitie on my sonne: for he is lunatike, and is sore vexed: for oft times he falleth into the fire, and oft times into the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not heale him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Iesus answered, and said, O generation faithlesse, and crooked, how long now shall I be with you! howe long nowe shall I suffer you! bring him hither to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Iesus rebuked the deuill, and he went out of him: and the childe was healed at that houre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then came the disciples to Iesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Iesus said vnto them, Because of your vnbeliefe: for verely I say vnto you, if ye haue faith as much as is a graine of mustarde seede, ye shall say vnto this mountaine, Remooue hence to yonder place, and it shall remoue: and nothing shalbe vnpossible vnto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Howbeit this kinde goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they being in Galile, Iesus said vnto them, The Sonne of man shall be deliuered into the handes of men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they shall kill him, but the thirde day shall he rise againe: and they were very sorie.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they were come to Capernaum, they that receiued polle money, came to Peter, and sayd, Doeth not your Master pay polle money?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He sayd, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Iesus preuented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whome doe the Kings of the earth take tribute, or polle money? of their children, or of strangers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Peter sayd vnto him, Of strangers. Then said Iesus vnto him, Then are the children free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Neuerthelesse, lest we should offend them: goe to the sea, and cast in an angle, and take the first fish that commeth vp, and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt finde a piece of twentie pence: that take, and giue it vnto them for me and thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The same time the disciples came vnto Iesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdome of heauen?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Wo be vnto the world because of offences: for it must needes be that offences shall come, but wo be to that man by whome the offence commeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore, if thy hand or thy foote cause thee to offend, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life, halt, or maimed, then hauing two hands, or two feete, to be cast into euerlasting fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And if thine eye cause thee to offende, plucke it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, then hauing two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">For the Sonne of man is come to saue that which was lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">How thinke ye? If a man haue an hundreth sheepe, and one of them be gone astray, doeth he not leaue ninetie and nine, and go into the mountaines, and seeke that which is gone astray?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">So is it not ye wil of your Father which is in heauen, that one of these litle ones should perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Moreouer, if thy brother trespasse against thee, goe and tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone: if he heare thee, thou hast wonne thy brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if he heare thee not, take yet with thee one or two, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses euery worde may be confirmed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if he refuse to heare them, tell it vnto the Church: and if he refuse to heare the Church also, let him be vnto thee as an heathen man, and a Publicane.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore is the kingdome of heauen likened vnto a certaine King, which would take an account of his seruants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought vnto him, which ought him ten thousand talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And because he had nothing to pay, his Lord commanded him to be solde, and his wife, and his children, and all that he had, and the dette to be payed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The seruant therefore fell downe, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, refraine thine anger toward me, and I will pay thee all.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherefore they are no more twaine, but one flesh. Let not man therefore put asunder that, which God hath coupled together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They said to him, Why did then Moses commaund to giue a bill of diuorcement, and to put her away?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He sayd vnto them, Moses, because of the hardnesse of your heart, suffered you to put away your wiues: but from the beginning it was not so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I say therefore vnto you, that whosoeuer shall put away his wife, except it be for whoredome, and marry another, committeth adulterie: and whosoeuer marieth her which is diuorced, doeth commit adulterie.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And assoone as he was come out of the water, Iohn saw the heauens clouen in twaine, and the holy Ghost descending vpon him like a doue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then there was a voyce from heauen, saying, Thou art my beloued Sonne, in whome I am well pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And immediatly the Spirite driueth him into the wildernesse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he was there in the wildernesse fourtie daies, and was tempted of Satan: hee was also with the wilde beastes, and the Angels ministred vnto him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdome of God is at hand: repent and beleeue the Gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And as he walked by the sea of Galile, he saw Simon, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, (for they were fishers.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Iesus said vnto them, Folow me, and I will make you to be fishers of men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">So they entred into Capernaum, and straightway on the Sabbath day hee entred into the Synagogue, and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they were astonied at his doctrine, for he taught them as one that had authoritie, and not as the Scribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there was in their Synagogue a man in whome was an vncleane spirite, and hee cried out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Saying, Ah, what haue we to do with thee, O Iesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy vs? I knowe thee what thou art, euen that holy one of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeled downe vnto him, and said to him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Iesus had compassion, and put foorth his hand, and touched him, and said to him, I wil: be thou cleane.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And assone as he had spoken, immediatly ye leprosie departed from him, and he was made cleane.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And after he had giue him a streight commandement, he sent him away forthwith,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Nowe when Iesus sawe their faith, he saide to the sicke of the palsie, Sonne, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there were certaine of the Scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Why doeth this man speake such blasphemies? who can forgiue sinnes, but God onely?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Whether is it easier to say to the sicke of the palsie, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee? or to say, Arise, and take vp thy bed, and walke?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But that ye may knowe, that the Sonne of man hath authoritie in earth to forgiue sinnes, (he sayde vnto the sicke of the palsie.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I say vnto thee, Arise and take vp thy bed, and get thee hence into thine owne house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And by and by he arose, and tooke vp his bed, and went foorth before them all, in so much that they were all amased, and glorified God, saying, We neuer sawe such a thing.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And they came to Hierusalem, and Iesus went into the Temple, and began to cast out them that solde and bought in the Temple, and ouerthrewe the tables of the money changers, and the seates of them that solde doues.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">For verely I say vnto you, that whosoeuer shall say vnto this mountaine, Be thou taken away, and cast into the sea, and shall not wauer in his heart, but shall beleeue that those things which he saieth, shall come to passe, whatsoeuer he saieth, shall be done to him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they came, they saide vnto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou considerest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God truely, Is it lawfull to giue tribute to Cesar, or not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Should we giue it, or should we not giue it? but he knew their hypocrisie, and said vnto them, Why tempt ye me? Bring me a peny, that I may see it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">Then opened he their vnderstanding, that they might vnderstand the Scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And said vnto them, Thus is it written, and thus it behoued Christ to suffer, and to rise againe from the dead the third day,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And that repentance, and remission of sinnes should be preached in his Name among all nations, beginning at Hierusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nowe ye are witnesses of these things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Euery branch that beareth not fruite in me, he taketh away: and euery one that beareth fruite, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Nowe are ye cleane through the worde, which I haue spoken vnto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Abide in me, and I in you: as the branche cannot beare fruite of it selfe, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I am that vine: ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruite: for without me can ye doe nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branche, and withereth: and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they burne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If ye abide in me, and my wordes abide in you, aske what ye wil, and it shalbe done to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Herein is my Father glorified, that ye beare much fruite, and be made my disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As the father hath loued me, so haue I loued you: continue in that my loue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">If ye shall keepe my commandements, ye shall abide in my loue, as I haue kept my Fathers commandements, and abide in his loue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">These things haue I spoken vnto you, that my ioy might remaine in you, and that your ioy might be full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">This is my commandement, that ye loue one another, as I haue loued you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Greater loue then this hath no man, when any man bestoweth his life for his friendes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Ye are my friendes, if ye doe whatsoeuer I commaund you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Henceforth call I you not seruants: for the seruant knoweth not what his master doeth: but I haue called you friends: for all things that I haue heard of my Father, haue I made knowen to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Ye haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you, and ordeined you, that ye goe and bring foorth fruite, and that your fruite remaine, that whatsoeuer ye shall aske of the Father in my Name, he may giue it you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These things commaund I you, that ye loue one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If the worlde hate you, ye knowe that it hated me before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If ye were of the worlde, the world woulde loue his owne: but because ye are not of ye world, but I haue chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Remember the word that I said vnto you, The seruant is not greater then his master. If they haue persecuted me, they will persecute you also: if they haue kept my worde, they will also keepe yours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But all these things will they doe vnto you for my Names sake, because they haue not knowen him that sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">If I had not come and spoken vnto them, they shoulde not haue had sinne: but nowe haue they no cloke for their sinne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If I had not done workes among them which none other man did, they had not had sinne: but nowe haue they both seene, and haue hated both me, and my Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But it is that the worde might be fulfilled, that is written in their Lawe, They hated me without a cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But when that Comforter shall come, whom I will send vnto you from the Father, euen the Spirit of trueth, which proceedeth of the Father, he shall testifie of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And ye shall witnesse also, because ye haue bene with me from the beginning.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">These thinges haue I saide vnto you, that ye should not be offended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They shall excommunicate you: yea, the time shall come, that whosoeuer killeth you, will thinke that he doeth God seruice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And these things will they doe vnto you, because they haue not knowen ye Father, nor me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But these things haue I tolde you, that when the houre shall come, ye might remember, that I tolde you them. And these things said I not vnto you from ye beginning, because I was with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But now I go my way to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But because I haue saide these thinges vnto you, your hearts are full of sorowe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yet I tell you the trueth, It is expedient for you that I goe away: for if I goe not away, that Comforter will not come vnto you: but if I depart, I will send him vnto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when he is come, he will reproue the worlde of sinne, and of righteousnesse, and of iudgement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Of sinne, because they beleeued not in me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Of righteousnesse, because I goe to my Father, and ye shall see me no more:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Of iudgement, because the prince of this world is iudged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I haue yet many things to say vnto you, but ye cannot beare them nowe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Howbeit, when he is come which is the Spirit of trueth, he will leade you into all trueth: for he shall not speake of himselfe, but whatsoeuer he shall heare, shall he speake, and he will shew you the things to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He shall glorifie me: for he shall receiue of mine, and shall shewe it vnto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">All thinges that the Father hath, are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shewe it vnto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">A litle while, and ye shall not see me: and againe a litle while, and ye shall see me: for I goe to the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then said some of his disciples among them selues, What is this that he saieth vnto vs, A litle while, and ye shall not see me, and againe, a litle while, and ye shall see me, and, For I goe to the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A litle while? we know not what he sayeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now Iesus knew that they would aske him, and said vnto them, Doe ye enquire among your selues, of that I said, A litle while, and ye shall not see me: and againe, a litle while, and yee shall see me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Verely, verely I say vnto you, that ye shall weepe and lament, and the worlde shall reioyce: and ye shall sorowe, but your sorowe shalbe turned to ioye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">A woman when she traueileth, hath sorowe, because her houre is come: but assoone as she is deliuered of the childe, she remembreth no more the anguish, for ioy that a man is borne into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And ye nowe therefore are in sorowe: but I will see you againe, and your hearts shall reioyce, and your ioy shall no man take from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And in that day shall ye aske me nothing. Verely, verely I say vnto you, whatsoeuer ye shall aske the Father in my Name, he will giue it you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Hitherto haue ye asked nothing in my Name: aske, and ye shall receiue, that your ioye may be full.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">These things haue I spoken vnto you in parables: but the time will come, when I shall no more speake to you in parables: but I shall shew you plainely of the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">At that day shall ye aske in my Name, and I say not vnto you, that I will pray vnto the Father for you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the Father himselfe loueth you, because ye haue loued me, and haue beleeued that I came out from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I am come out from the Father, and came into the worlde: againe I leaue the worlde, and goe to the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">His disciples saide vnto him, Loe, nowe speakest thou plainely, and thou speakest no parable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Nowe knowe wee that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should aske thee. By this we beleeue, that thou art come out from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Iesus answered them, Doe you beleeue nowe?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Beholde, the houre commeth, and is already come, that ye shalbe scattered euery man into his owne, and shall leaue me alone: but I am not alone: for the Father is with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">These thinges haue I spoken vnto you, that in me ye might haue peace: in the world ye shall haue affliction, but be of good comfort: I haue ouercome the world.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">These things spake Iesus, and lift vp his eyes to heauen, and saide, Father, that houre is come: glorifie thy Sonne, that thy Sonne also may glorifie thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">As thou hast giuen him power ouer all flesh, that he shoulde giue eternall life to all them that thou hast giuen him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And this is life eternall, that they knowe thee to be the onely very God, and whom thou hast sent, Iesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I haue glorified thee on the earth: I haue finished the worke which thou gauest me to doe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And nowe glorifie me, thou Father, with thine owne selfe, with the glorie which I had with thee before the world was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I haue declared thy Name vnto the men which thou gauest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gauest them me, and they haue kept thy worde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Nowe they knowe that all things whatsoeuer thou hast giuen me, are of thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For I haue giuen vnto them the wordes which thou gauest me, and they haue receiued them, and haue knowen surely that I came out from thee, and haue beleeued that thou hast sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I pray for them: I pray not for the worlde, but for them which thou hast giuen me: for they are thine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And al mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And nowe am I no more in the world, but these are in the worlde, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keepe them in thy Name, euen them whome thou hast giuen mee, that they may bee one, as we are.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">While I was with them in the worlde, I kept them in thy Name: those that thou gauest me, haue I kept, and none of them is lost, but the childe of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And now come I to thee, and these things speake I in the worlde, that they might haue my ioy fulfilled in themselues.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I haue giuen them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou keepe them from euill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They are not of the worlde, as I am not of the world.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When Iesus had spoken these things, hee went foorth with his disciples ouer the brooke Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entred, and his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Iudas which betraied him, knewe also the place: for Iesus oft times resorted thither with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Iudas then, after hee had receiued a band of men and officers of the high Priests, and of the Pharises, came thither with lanternes and torches, and weapons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Iesus, knowing all things that shoulde come vnto him, went foorth and said vnto them, Whom seeke yee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They answered him, Iesus of Nazareth. Iesus sayde vnto them, I am hee. Nowe Iudas also which betraied him, stoode with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Assoone then as hee had saide vnto them, I am hee, they went away backewardes, and fell to the grounde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then he asked them againe, Whome seeke yee? And they sayd, Iesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Iesus answered, I said vnto you, that I am he: therefore if ye seeke me, let these go their way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This was that the worde might be fulfilled which hee spake, Of them which thou gauest me, haue I lost none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Simon Peter hauing a sword, drewe it, and smote the hie Priests seruant, and cut off his right eare. Nowe the seruants name was Malchus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then sayde Iesus vnto Peter, Put vp thy sworde into the sheath: shall I not drinke of the cuppe which my Father hath giuen me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the bande and the captaine, and the officers of the Iewes tooke Iesus, and bound him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And led him away to Annas first (for he was father in lawe to Caiaphas, which was the hie Priest that same yeere)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Caiaphas was he, that gaue counsel to the Iewes, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Nowe Simon Peter folowed Iesus, and another disciple, and that disciple was knowen of the hie Priest: therefore he went in with Iesus into the hall of the hie Priest:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Peter stood at the doore without. Then went out the other disciple which was knowen vnto the hie Priest, and spake to her that kept the doore, and brought in Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then saide the maide that kept the doore, vnto Peter, Art not thou also one of this mans disciples? He sayd, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the seruants and officers stoode there, which had made a fire of coles: for it was colde, and they warmed themselues. And Peter also stood among them, and warmed himselfe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(The hie Priest then asked Iesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Iesus answered him, I spake openly to the world: I euer taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whither the Iewes resort continually, and in secret haue I sayde nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Why askest thou mee? aske them which heard mee what I sayde vnto them: beholde, they knowe what I sayd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When he had spoken these thinges, one of the officers which stoode by, smote Iesus with his rod, saying, Answerest thou the hie Priest so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Iesus answered him, If I haue euill spoken, beare witnes of the euil: but if I haue well spoken, why smitest thou me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Nowe Annas had sent him bound vnto Caiaphas the hie Priest)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Simon Peter stoode and warmed himselfe, and they said vnto him, Art not thou also of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">One of the seruaunts of the hie Priest, his cousin whose eare Peter smote off, saide, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Peter then denied againe, and immediatly the cocke crewe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then led they Iesus from Caiaphas into the common hall. Nowe it was morning, and they themselues went not into the common hall, least they should be defiled, but that they might eate the Passeouer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Pilate then went out vnto them, and said, What accusation bring yee against this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They answered, and saide vnto him, If hee were not an euill doer, we woulde not haue deliuered him vnto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then sayde Pilate vnto them, Take yee him, and iudge him after your owne Lawe. Then the Iewes sayde vnto him, It is not lawfull for vs to put any man to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">It was that the worde of Iesus might be fulfilled which he spake, signifying what death he should die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Pilate entred into the common hall againe, and called Iesus, and sayde vnto him, Art thou the king of the Iewes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Iesus answered him, Saiest thou that of thy selfe, or did other tell it thee of me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate answered, Am I a Iewe? Thine owne nation, and the hie Priestes haue deliuered thee vnto me. What hast thou done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Iesus answered, My kingdome is not of this worlde: if my kingdome were of this worlde, my seruants would surely fight, that I should not be deliuered to the Iewes: but nowe is my kingdome not from hence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Pilate then said vnto him, Art thou a King then? Iesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a King: for this cause am I borne, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should beare witnes vnto the trueth: euery one that is of the trueth, heareth my voyce.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pilate said vnto him, What is trueth? And when he had saide that, hee went out againe vnto the Iewes, and said vnto them, I finde in him no cause at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But you haue a custome, that I shoulde deliuer you one loose at the Passeouer: will yee then that I loose vnto you the King of ye Iewes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then cried they all againe, saying, Not him, but Barabbas: nowe this Barabbas was a murtherer.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Pilate tooke Iesus and scourged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the souldiers platted a crowne of thornes, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple garment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And saide, Haile, King of the Iewes. And they smote him with their roddes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Pilate went foorth againe, and said vnto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may knowe, that I finde no fault in him at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then came Iesus foorth wearing a crowne of thornes, and a purple garment. And Pilate said vnto them, Beholde the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then when the hie Priests and officers sawe him, they cried, saying, Crucifie, crucifie him. Pilate said vnto them, Take yee him and crucifie him: for I finde no fault in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Iewes answered him, We haue a lawe, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himselfe the Sonne of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Pilate then heard that woorde, he was the more afraide,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And went againe into the common hall, and saide vnto Iesus, Whence art thou? But Iesus gaue him none answere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then saide Pilate vnto him, Speakest thou not vnto me? Knowest thou not that I haue power to crucifie thee, and haue power to loose thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Iesus answered, Thou couldest haue no power at all against me, except it were giuen thee from aboue: therefore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath the greater sinne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">From thence foorth Pilate sought to loose him, but the Iewes cried, saying, If thou deliuer him, thou art not Cesars friende: for whosoeuer maketh himselfe a King, speaketh against Cesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Pilate heard this woorde, hee brought Iesus foorth, and sate downe in the iudgement seate in a place called the Pauement, and in Hebrewe, Gabbatha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And it was the Preparation of the Passeouer, and about the sixt houre: and hee sayde vnto the Iewes, Beholde your King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But they cried, Away with him, away with him, crucifie him. Pilate sayde vnto them, Shall I crucifie your King? The high Priestes answered, We haue no King but Cesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then deliuered he him vnto them, to be crucified. And they tooke Iesus, and led him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he bare his owne crosse, and came into a place named of dead mens Skulles, which is called in Hebrewe, Golgotha:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Iesus in the middes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Pilate wrote also a title, and put it on the crosse, and it was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWES.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">This title then read many of the Iewes: for the place where Iesus was crucified, was neere to the citie: and it was written in Hebrewe, Greeke and Latine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then saide the hie Priests of the Iewes to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Iewes, but that he sayd, I am King of the Iewes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, What I haue written, I haue written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then the souldiers, when they had crucified Iesus, tooke his garments (and made foure partes, to euery souldier a part) and his coat: and the coat was without seame wouen from the toppe throughout.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore they sayde one to another, Let vs not deuide it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be. This was that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which sayth, They parted my garments among them, and on my coate did cast lots. So the souldiers did these things in deede.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then stoode by the crosse of Iesus his mother, and his mothers sister, Marie the wife of Cleopas, and Marie Magdalene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when Iesus sawe his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loued, he said vnto his mother, Woman, beholde thy sonne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then saide he to the disciple, Beholde thy mother: and from that houre, the disciple tooke her home vnto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After, when Iesus knew that all things were performed, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, he said, I thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And there was set a vessell full of vineger: and they filled a spondge with vineger: and put it about an Hyssope stalke, and put it to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Nowe when Iesus had receiued of the vineger, he saide, It is finished, and bowed his head, and gaue vp the ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Iewes then (because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remaine vpon the crosse on the Sabbath day: for that Sabbath was an hie day) besought Pilate that their legges might be broken, and that they might be taken downe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then came the souldiers and brake the legges of the first, and of the other, which was crucified with Iesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But when they came to Iesus, and saw that he was dead alreadie, they brake not his legges.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But one of the souldiers with a speare pearced his side, and foorthwith came there out blood and water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he that sawe it, bare recorde, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might beleeue it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For these things were done, that the Scripture shoulde be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shalbe broken.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And as they spake vnto the people, the Priestes and the Captaine of the Temple, and the Sadduces came vpon them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Taking it grieuously that they taught the people, and preached in Iesus Name the resurrection from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they layde handes on them, and put them in holde, vntill the next day: for it was now euentide.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Howbeit, many of them which heard the word, beleeued, and the number of the men was about fiue thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it came to passe on the morow, that their rulers, and Elders, and Scribes, were gathered together at Hierusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Annas the chiefe Priest, and Caiaphas, and Iohn, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the hie Priestes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And whe they had set them before them, they asked, By what power, or in what Name haue ye done this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Peter ful of the holy Ghost, said vnto them, Ye rulers of the people, and Elders of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For as much as we this day are examined of the good deede done to the impotent man, to wit, by what meanes he is made whole,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Be it knowen vnto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye haue crucified, whome God raised againe from the dead, euen by him doth this man stand here before you, whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This is the stone cast aside of you builders which is become the head of the corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Neither is there saluation in any other: for among men there is giuen none other Name vnder heauen, whereby we must be saued.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when they sawe the boldnes of Peter and Iohn, and vnderstoode that they were vnlearned men and without knowledge, they marueiled, and knew them, that they had bin with Iesus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And beholding also the man which was healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then they commanded them to goe aside out of the Council, and conferred among themselues,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Saying, What shall we doe to these men? for surely a manifest signe is done by them, and it is openly knowen to all them that dwell in Hierusalem: and we cannot denie it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But that it be noysed no farther among the people, let vs threaten and charge them, that they speake hencefoorth to no man in this Name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So they called them, and commanded them, that in no wise they should speake or teach in the Name of Iesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Peter and Iohn answered vnto them, and said, Whether it be right in the sight of God, to obey you rather then God, iudge ye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For we cannot but speake the things which we haue seene and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So they threatened them, and let them goe, and found nothing how to punish them, because of the people: for all men praised God for that which was done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the man was aboue fourtie yeeres olde, on whome this miracle of healing was shewed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then assoone as they were let goe, they came to their fellowes, and shewed all that the hie Priestes and Elders had said vnto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they heard it, they lift vp their voyces to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou art the God which hast made the heaue, and the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Which by the mouth of thy seruant Dauid hast saide, Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people imagine vaine things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The Kings of the earth assembled, and the rulers came together against the Lord, and against his Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For doutlesse, against thine holy Sonne Iesus, whome thou haddest anoynted, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel gathered themselues together,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">To doe whatsoeuer thine hand, and thy counsell had determined before to be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And nowe, O Lord, beholde their threatnings, and graunt vnto thy seruants with all boldnesse to speake thy word,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So that thou stretch forth thine hand, that healing, and signes, and wonders may be done by the Name of thine holy Sonne Iesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when as they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God boldely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the multitude of them that beleeued, were of one heart, and of one soule: neither any of them said, that any thing of that which he possessed, was his owne, but they had all thinges common.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And with great power gaue the Apostles witnes of the resurrection of the Lord Iesus: and great grace was vpon them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Neither was there any among them, that lacked: for as many as were possessours of landes or houses, solde them, and brought the price of the things that were solde,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And layde it downe at the Apostles feete, and it was distributed vnto euery man, according as he had neede.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Also Ioses which was called of the Apostles, Barnabas (that is by interpretation the sonne of consolation) being a Leuite, and of the countrey of Cyprus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Where as he had land, solde it, and brought the money, and laid it downe at the Apostles feete.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But a certaine man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, solde a possession,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And kept away part of the price, his wife also being of counsell, and brought a certaine part, and layde it downe at the Apostles feete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then saide Peter, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart, that thou shouldest lye vnto the holy Ghost, and keepe away part of the price of this possession?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Whiles it remained, appertained it not vnto thee? and after it was solde, was it not in thine owne power? howe is it that thou hast conceiued this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lyed vnto men, but vnto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now when Ananias heard these wordes, he fell downe, and gaue vp the ghost. Then great feare came on all them that heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the yong men rose vp, and tooke him vp, and caried him out, and buried him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to passe about the space of three houres after, that his wife came in, ignorant of that which was done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Peter sayd vnto her, Tell me, solde ye the land for so much? And she sayd, Yea, for so much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Peter sayde vnto her, Why haue ye agreed together, to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? beholde, the feete of them which haue buried thine husband, are at the doore, and shall carie thee out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then she fell downe straightway at his feete, and yeelded vp the ghost: and the yong men came in, and found her dead, and caried her out, and buried her by her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And great feare came on all the Church, and on as many as heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Thus by the hands of the Apostles were many signes and wonders shewed among the people (and they were all with one accorde in Salomons porche.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And of the other durst no man ioyne him selfe to them: neuerthelesse the people magnified them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Also the number of them that beleeued in the Lord, both of men and women, grewe more and more)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In so much that they brought the sicke into the streetes, and layd them on beds and couches, that at the least way the shadowe of Peter, when he came by, might shadow some of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There came also a multitude out of the cities round about vnto Hierusalem, bringing sicke folkes, and them which were vexed with vncleane spirits, who were all healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then the chiefe Priest rose vp, and all they that were with him (which was the sect of the Sadduces) and were full of indignation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And laide hands on the Apostles, and put them in the common prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But the Angel of the Lord, by night opened the prison doores, and brought them forth, and sayd,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Go your way, and stand in the Temple, and speake to the people, all the wordes of this life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So when they heard it, they entred into the Temple early in the morning, and taught. And the chiefe Priest came, and they that were with him, and called the Councill together, and all the Elders of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison, to cause them to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and tolde it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Saying, Certainely we founde the prison shut as sure as was possible, and the keepers standing without, before the doores: but when we had opened, we found no man within.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then when the chiefe Priest, and the captaine of the Temple, and the hie Priestes heard these things, they doubted of them, whereunto this would growe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then came one and shewed them, saying, Beholde, the men that ye put in prison, are standing in the Temple, and teach the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then went the captaine with the officers, and brought them without violence (for they feared the people, lest they should haue bene stoned)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when they had brought them, they set them before the Councill, and the chiefe Priest asked them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Saying, Did not we straightly commaund you, that ye should not teach in this Name? and behold, ye haue filled Hierusale with your doctrine, and ye would bring this mans blood vpon vs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Peter and the Apostles answered, and sayd, We ought rather to obey God then men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The God of our fathers hath raised vp Iesus, whom ye slewe, and hanged on a tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Him hath God lift vp with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Sauiour, to giue repentance to Israel, and forgiuenes of sinnes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And we are his witnesses concerning these things which we say: yea, and the holy Ghost, whome God hath giuen to them that obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now when they heard it, they brast for anger, and consulted to slay them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then stoode there vp in the Councill a certaine Pharise named Gamaliel, a doctour of the Lawe, honoured of all the people, and commanded to put the Apostles forth a litle space,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And sayd vnto them, Men of Israel, take heede to your selues, what ye intende to doe touching these men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For before these times, rose vp Theudas boasting himselfe, to whom resorted a number of men, about a foure hundreth, who was slaine: and they all which obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">After this man, arose vp Iudas of Galile, in the dayes of the tribute, and drewe away much people after him: hee also perished, and all that obeyed him, were scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And nowe I say vnto you, Refraine your selues from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsell, or this worke be of men, it will come to nought:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if it be of God, ye can not destroy it, lest ye be found euen fighters against God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And to him they agreed, and called the Apostles: and when they had beaten them, they commanded that they should not speake in the Name of Iesus, and let them goe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">So they departed from the Councill, reioycing, that they were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for his Name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And dayly in the Temple, and from house to house they ceased not to teach, and preach Iesus Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And in those dayes, as the nomber of ye disciples grewe, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians towards ye Hebrewes, because their widowes were neglected in the dayly ministring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the twelue called the multitude of the disciples together, and sayd, It is not meete that we should leaue the worde of God to serue the tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Wherefore brethren, looke ye out among you seuen men of honest report, and full of the holy Ghost, and of wisedome, which we may appoint to this busines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And we will giue our selues continually to prayer, and to the ministration of the worde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Steuen a man full of fayth and of the holy Ghost, and Philippe, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a Proselyte of Antiochia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Which they set before the Apostles: and they prayed, and layed their hands on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the worde of God increased, and the nomber of the disciples was multipled in Hierusalem greatly, and a great company of the Priests were obedient to the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now Steuen full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then there arose certaine of the Synagogue, which are called Libertines, and Cyrenians, and of Alexandria, and of them of Cilicia, and of Asia, and disputed with Steuen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But they were not able to resist the wisdome, and the Spirit by the which he spake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then they suborned men, which saide, We haue heard him speake blasphemous wordes against Moses, and God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Thus they mooued the people and the Elders, and the Scribes: and running vpon him, caught him, and brought him to the Councill,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And set forth false witnesses, which sayd, This man ceasseth not to speake blasphemous wordes against this holy place, and the Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we haue heard him say, that this Iesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the ordinances, which Moses gaue vs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And as all that sate in the Councill, looked stedfastly on him, they saw his face as it had bene the face of an Angel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then sayd the chiefe Priest, Are these things so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he sayd, Ye men, brethren and Fathers, hearken. That God of glory appeared vnto our father Abraham, while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And said vnto him, Come out of thy countrey, and from thy kindred, and come into the land, which I shall shewe thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran. And after that his father was dead, God brought him from thence into this land, wherein ye now dwell,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And hee gaue him none inheritance in it, no, not the bredth of a foote: yet he promised that he would giue it to him for a possession, and to his seede after him, when as yet hee had no childe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But God spake thus, that his seede should be a soiourner in a strange land: and that they should keepe it in bondage, and entreate it euill foure hundreth yeeres.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the nation to whome they shall be in bondage, will I iudge, sayth God: and after that, they shall come forth and serue me in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Hee gaue him also the couenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begate Isaac, and circumcised him the eight day: and Isaac begate Iacob, and Iacob the twelue Patriarkes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Patriarkes moued with enuie, solde Ioseph into Egypt: but God was with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And deliuered him out of all his afflictions, and gaue him fauour and wisdome in the sight of Pharao King of Egypt, who made him gouernour ouer Egypt, and ouer his whole house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then came there a famine ouer all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction, that our fathers found no sustenance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when Iacob heard that there was corne in Egypt, he sent our fathers first:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And at the second time, Ioseph was knowen of his brethren, and Iosephs kindred was made knowen vnto Pharao.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then sent Ioseph and caused his father to be brought, and all his kindred, euen threescore and fifteene soules.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So Iacob went downe into Egypt, and he dyed, and our fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And were remoued into Sychem, and were put in the sepulchre, that Abraham had bought for money of the sonnes of Emor, sonne of Sychem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But when the time of the promise drewe neere, which God had sworne to Abraham, the people grewe and multiplied in Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Till another King arose, which knewe not Ioseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and euill entreated our fathers, and made them to cast out their yong children, that they should not remaine aliue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The same time was Moses borne, and was acceptable vnto God, which was nourished vp in his fathers house three moneths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when he was cast out, Pharaohs daughter tooke him vp, and nourished him for her owne sonne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Moses was learned in all the wisdome of the Egyptians, and was mightie in wordes and in deedes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Nowe when he was full fourtie yeere olde, it came into his heart to visite his brethren, the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And whe he saw one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and auenged his quarell that had the harme done to him, and smote the Egyptian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For hee supposed his brethren would haue vnderstand, that God by his hande should giue them deliuerance: but they vnderstoode it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the next day, he shewed himselfe vnto them as they stroue, and woulde haue set them at one againe, saying, Syrs, ye are brethren: why doe ye wrong one to another?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But he that did his neighbour wrong, thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a prince, and a iudge ouer vs?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Wilt thou kill mee, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then fled Moses at that saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begate two sonnes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when fourtie yeres were expired, there appeared to him in the wildernes of mout Sina, an Angel of the Lord in a flame of fire, in a bush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when Moses sawe it, hee wondred at the sight: and as he drew neere to consider it, the voyce of the Lord came vnto him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the Lord said to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feete: for the place where thou standest, is holy ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">I haue seene, I haue seene the affliction of my people, which is in Egypt, and I haue heard their groning, and am come downe to deliuer them: and nowe come, and I will sende thee into Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">This Moses whome they forsooke, saying, Who made thee a prince and a iudge? the same God sent for a prince, and a deliuerer by the hand of the Angel, which appeared to him in the bush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Hee brought them out, doing wonders, and miracles in the land of Egypt, and in the red sea, and in the wildernes fourtie yeeres.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">This is that Moses, which saide vnto the children of Israel, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise vp vnto you, euen of your brethren, like vnto me: him shall ye heare.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">This is he that was in the Congregation, in the wildernes with the Angell, which spake to him in mount Sina, and with our fathers, who receiued the liuely oracles to giue vnto vs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">To whom our fathers would not obey, but refused, and in their hearts turned backe againe into Egypt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Saying vnto Aaron, Make vs gods that may goe before vs: for we knowe not what is become of this Moses that brought vs out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And they made a calfe in those dayes, and offered sacrifice vnto the idole, and reioyced in the workes of their owne handes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Then God turned himselfe away, and gaue them vp to serue the host of heauen, as it is written in the booke of the Prophets, O house of Israel, haue ye offred to me slaine beasts and sacrifices by the space of fourtie yeres in the wildernes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And ye tooke vp the tabernacle of Moloch, and the starre of your god Remphan, figures, which ye made to worship them: therefore I will carie you away beyond Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Our fathers had the tabernacle of witnes, in the wildernes, as hee had appointed, speaking vnto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Which tabernacle also our fathers receiued, and brought in with Iesus into the possession of the Gentiles, which God draue out before our fathers, vnto the dayes of Dauid:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Who found fauour before God, and desired that hee might finde a tabernacle for the God of Iacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">But Salomon built him an house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with handes, as saith the Prophet,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Heauen is my throne, and earth is my footestoole: what house wil ye build for me, saith the Lord? or what place is it that I should rest in?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Hath not mine hand made all these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Ye stiffenecked and of vncircumcised heartes and eares, ye haue alwayes resisted the holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Which of the Prophets haue not your fathers persecuted? and they haue slaine them, which shewed before of the comming of that Iust, of whome ye are now the betrayers and murtherers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Which haue receiued the Lawe by the ordinance of Angels, and haue not kept it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But when they heard these thinges, their heartes brast for anger, and they gnashed at him with their teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But he being full of the holy Ghost, looked stedfastly into heauen, and sawe the glory of God, and Iesus standing at the right hand of God,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Now I certifie you, brethren, that ye Gospel which was preached of me, was not after man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For neither receiued I it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the reuelation of Iesus Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But neither yet Titus which was with me, though he were a Grecian, was compelled to be circumcised,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">But by them which seemed to be great, I was not taught (whatsoeuer they were in time passed, I am nothing the better: God accepteth no mans person) for they that are the chiefe, did adde nothing to me aboue that I had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But contrariwise, when they saw that ye Gospel ouer ye vncircumcision was comitted vnto me, as the Gospel ouer ye circumcision was vnto Peter:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And when Iames, and Cephas, and Iohn, knew of the grace that was giuen vnto me, which are counted to be pillars, they gaue to me and to Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should preach vnto the Gentiles, and they vnto the Circumcision,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Warning onely that we should remember the poore: which thing also I was diligent to doe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when Peter was come to Antiochia, I withstood him to his face: for he was to be condemned.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">But when I saw, that they went not ye right way to the trueth of ye Gospel, I sayd vnto Peter before all men, If thou being a Iewe, liuest as the Gentiles, and not like the Iewes, why constrainest thou the Gentiles to doe like the Iewes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We which are Iewes by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Knowe that a man is not iustified by the works of the Law, but by ye faith of Iesus Christ, euen we, I say, haue beleeued in Iesus Christ, that we might be iustified by the faith of Christ, and not by the workes of the Lawe, because that by the workes of the Lawe, no flesh shalbe iustified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If then while we seeke to be made righteous by Christ, we our selues are found sinners, is Christ therefore the minister of sinne? God forbid.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Yea rather as Abraham beleeued God, and it was imputed to him for righteousnes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Knowe ye therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the Scripture foreseeing, that God would iustifie the Gentiles through faith, preached before the Gospel vnto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all the Gentiles be blessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So then they which be of faith, are blessed with faithfull Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For as many as are of the workes of the Lawe, are vnder the curse: for it is written, Cursed is euery man that continueth not in all things, which are written in the booke of the Law, to doe them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And that no man is iustified by the Law in the sight of God, it is euident: for the iust shall liue by faith.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the Lawe, made a curse for vs, (for it is written, Cursed is euery one that hangeth on tree)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Iesus, that wee might receiue the promise of the Spirite through faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Brethren, I speake as men do: though it be but a mans couenant, when it is confirmed, yet no man doeth abrogate it, or addeth any thing thereto.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Nowe to Abraham and his seede were the promises made. Hee saith not, And to the seedes, as speaking of many: but, And to thy seede, as of one, which is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this I say, that the couenant that was confirmed afore of God in respect of Christ, the Lawe which was foure hundreth and thirtie yeeres after, can not disanull, that it shoulde make the promise of none effect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if the inheritance be of the Lawe, it is no more by the promise, but God gaue it freely vnto Abraham by promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Wherefore then serueth the Law? It was added because of the transgressions, til the seed came, vnto the which the promise was made: and it was ordeined by Angels in the hande of a Mediatour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Nowe a Mediatour is not a Mediatour of one: but God is one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Is the Lawe then against the promises of God? God forbid: For if there had bene a Lawe giuen which coulde haue giuen life, surely righteousnes should haue bene by the Lawe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the Scripture hath concluded all vnder sinne, that the promise by the faith of Iesus Christ should be giuen to them that beleeue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But before faith came, we were kept vnder the Law, as vnder a garison, and shut vp vnto that faith, which should afterward be reueiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Wherefore the Lawe was our scholemaster to bring vs to Christ, that we might be made righteous by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But after that faith is come, we are no longer vnder a scholemaster.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For ye are al the sonnes of God by faith, in Christ Iesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace be with you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I thanke my God, hauing you in perfect memorie,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">(Alwayes in all my praiers for all you, praying with gladnesse)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Because of the fellowship which ye haue in the Gospel, from the first day vnto nowe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I am persuaded of this same thing, that he that hath begunne this good worke in you, wil perfourme it vntill the day of Iesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As it becommeth me so to iudge of you all, because I haue you in remembrance that both in my bands, and in my defence, and confirmation of the Gospell you all were partakers of my grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For God is my recorde, howe I long after you all from the very heart roote in Iesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And this I pray, that your loue may abound, yet more and more in knowledge, and in all iudgement,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">That ye may alowe those things which are best, that ye may be pure, and without offence vntill the day of Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Filled with the fruites of righteousnesse, which are by Iesus Christ vnto the glorie and praise of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I would ye vnderstood, brethren, that the things which haue come vnto me, are turned rather to the furthering of the Gospell,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So that my bandes in Christ are famous throughout all the iudgement hall, and in all other places,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In so much that many of the brethren in the Lord are boldened through my bandes, and dare more frankely speake the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Some preache. Christ euen through enuie and strife, and some also of good will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The one part preacheth Christ of contention and not purely, supposing to adde more affliction to my bandes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But the others of loue, knowing that I am set for the defence of the Gospell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">What then? yet Christ is preached all maner wayes, whether it be vnder a pretence, or syncerely: and I therein ioye: yea and will ioye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I knowe that this shall turne to my saluation through your prayer, and by the helpe of the Spirit of Iesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As I feruently looke for, and hope, that in nothing I shalbe ashamed, but that with all confidence, as alwayes, so nowe Christ shalbe magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For Christ is to me both in life, and in death aduantage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And whether to liue in the flesh were profitable for me, and what to chuse I knowe not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For I am distressed betweene both, desiring to be loosed and to be with Christ, which is best of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Neuerthelesse, to abide in the flesh, is more needefull for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And this am I sure of, that I shall abide, and with you all continue, for your furtherance and ioy of your faith,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">That ye may more aboundantly reioyce in IESVS CHRIST for me, by my comming to you againe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Onely let your conuersation be, as it becommeth the Gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you, or els be absent, I may heare of your matters that ye continue in one Spirit, and in one mind, fighting together through the faith of the Gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And in nothing feare your aduersaries, which is to them a token of perdition, and to you of saluation, and that of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For vnto you it is giuen for Christ, that not onely ye should beleeue in him, but also suffer for his sake,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Hauing the same fight, which ye sawe in me, and nowe heare to be in me.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">If there be therfore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of loue, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any compassion and mercie,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Fulfill my ioye, that ye be like minded, hauing the same loue, being of one accorde, and of one iudgement,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">That nothing be done through contention or vaine glory, but that in meekenesse of minde euery man esteeme other better then himselfe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Looke not euery man on his owne things, but euery man also on the things of other men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let the same minde be in you that was euen in Christ Iesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Who being in ye forme of God, thought it no robberie to be equall with God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But he made himself of no reputation, and tooke on him ye forme of a seruant, and was made like vnto men, and was founde in shape as a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He humbled himselfe, and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the Crosse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore God hath also highly exalted him, and giuen him a Name aboue euery name,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">That at the Name of Iesus shoulde euery knee bowe, both of things in heauen, and things in earth, and things vnder the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And that euery tongue shoulde confesse that Iesus Christ is the Lord, vnto the glory of God the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Wherefore my beloued, as ye haue alwayes obeyed me, not as in my presence only, but now much more in mine absence, so make an end of your owne saluation with feare and trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For it is God which worketh in you, both the will and the deede, euen of his good pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Do all things without murmuring and reasonings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That ye may be blamelesse, and pure, and the sonnes of God without rebuke in the middes of a naughtie and crooked nation, among whom yee shine as lights in the world,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Holding forth the worde of life, that I may reioyce in the day of Christ, that I haue not runne in vaine, neither haue laboured in vaine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Yea, and though I bee offered vp vpon the sacrifice, and seruice of your faith, I am glad, and reioyce with you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the same cause also be ye glad, and reioyce with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I trust in the Lord Iesus, to sende Timotheus shortly vnto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I knowe your state.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For I haue no man like minded, who will faithfully care for your matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For all seeke their owne, and not that which is Iesus Christes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But yee knowe the proofe of him, that as a sonne with the father, hee hath serued with me in the Gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Him therefore I hope to send assoone as I knowe howe it will goe with me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And trust in the Lord, that I also my selfe shall come shortly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I supposed it necessarie to sende my brother Epaphroditus vnto you, my companion in labour, and fellowe souldier, euen your messenger, and he that ministred vnto me such things as I wanted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For he longed after all you, and was full of heauinesse, because yee had heard that hee had beene sicke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And no doubt he was sicke, very neere vnto death: but God had mercie on him, and not on him onely, but on me also, least I should haue sorowe vpon sorowe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I sent him therefore the more diligently, that when yee shoulde see him againe, yee might reioyce, and I might be the lesse sorowfull.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Receiue him therefore in the Lord with all gladnesse, and make much of such:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Because that for the woorke of Christ he was neere vnto death, and regarded not his life, to fulfill that seruice which was lacking on your part towarde me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Beware of dogges: beware of euil workers: beware of the concision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirite, and reioyce in Christ Iesus, and haue no confidence in the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Though I might also haue confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, much more I,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Concerning zeale, I persecuted ye Church: touching the righteousnesse which is in the Law, I was vnrebukeable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the thinges that were vantage vnto me, the same I counted losse for Christes sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yea, doubtlesse I thinke all thinges but losse for the excellent knowledge sake of Christ Iesus my Lord, for whome I haue counted all things losse, and doe iudge them to bee dongue, that I might winne Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And might bee founde in him, that is, not hauing mine owne righteousnesse, which is of the Lawe, but that which is through the faith of Christ, euen the righteousnesse which is of God through faith,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">That I may know him, and the vertue of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his afflictions, and be made conformable vnto his death,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If by any meanes I might attaine vnto the resurrection of the dead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Not as though I had alreadie attained to it, either were alreadie perfect: but I follow, if that I may comprehend that for whose sake also I am comprehended of Christ Iesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Who being the brightnes of the glory, and the ingraued forme of his person, and bearing vp all things by his mightie worde, hath by himselfe purged our sinnes, and sitteth at the right hand of the Maiestie in the highest places,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And is made so much more excellent then the Angels, in as much as hee hath obteined a more excellent Name then they.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Wherefore wee ought diligently to giue heede to the thinges which wee haue heard, lest at any time we runne out.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">For he in no sort tooke on him the Angels nature, but hee tooke on him the seede of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Wherefore in all things it behoued him to be made like vnto his brethren, that hee might be mercifull, and a faithfull hie Priest in things concerning God, that he might make reconciliation for the sinnes of the people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">For euery house is builded of some man, and he that hath built all things, is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Moses verely was faithfull in all his house, as a seruant, for a witnesse of the thinges which should be spoken after.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Harden not your hearts, as in the prouocation, according to the day of the tentation in the wildernes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Where your fathers tempted me, prooued me, and sawe my workes fourtie yeeres long.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Wherefore I was grieued with that generation, and sayde, They erre euer in their heart, neither haue they knowen my wayes.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">But exhort one another dayly, while it is called to day, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulnes of sinne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we are made partakers of Christ, if we keepe sure vnto the ende that beginning, wherewith we are vpholden,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So long as it is sayd, To day if ye heare his voyce, harden not your hearts, as in the prouocation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he that is entred into his rest, hath also ceased from his owne works, as God did from his.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">For God is not vnrighteous, that hee should forget your worke, and labour of loue, which ye shewed toward his Name, in that ye haue ministred vnto the Saints, and yet minister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And we desire that euery one of you shew the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope vnto the ende,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">That ye be not slouthfull, but followers of them, which through faith and patience, inherite the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For when God made the promise to Abraham, because he had no greater to sweare by, he sware by himselfe,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Saying, Surely I wil aboundantly blesse thee and multiplie thee marueilously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And so after that he had taried patiently, he enioyed the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For men verely sweare by him that is greater then themselues, and an othe for confirmation is among them an ende of all strife.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Which hope we haue, as an ancre of the soule, both sure and stedfast, and it entreth into that which is within the vaile,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Whither the forerunner is for vs entred in, euen Iesus that is made an hie Priest for euer after the order of Melchi-sedec.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchi-sedec was King of Salem, the Priest of the most high God, who met Abraham, as he returned from the slaughter of the Kings, and blessed him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To whom also Abraham gaue the tithe of all things: who first is by interpretation King of righteousnes: after that, he is also King of Salem, that is, King of peace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Without father, without mother, without kinred, and hath neither beginning of his dayes, neither ende of life: but is likened vnto the Sonne of God, and continueth a Priest for euer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nowe consider how great this man was, vnto whome euen the Patriarke Abraham gaue the tithe of the spoyles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For verely they which are the childre of Leui, which receiue the office of the Priesthode, haue a commandement to take, according to the Law, tithes of the people (that is, of their bethren) though they came out of ye loynes of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he whose kindred is not couted among them, receiued tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And without all contradiction the lesse is blessed of the greater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And here men that die, receiue tithes: but there he receiueth them, of whome it is witnessed, that he liueth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And to say as the thing is, Leui also which receiueth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For hee was yet in the loynes of his father Abraham, when Melchi-sedec met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If therefore perfection had bene by the Priesthoode of the Leuites (for vnder it the Lawe was established to the people) what needed it furthermore, that another Priest should rise after the order of Melchi-sedec, and not to be called after the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For if the Priesthood be changed, then of necessitie must there be a change of the Lawe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For hee of whome these things are spoken, perteineth vnto another tribe, whereof no man serued at the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is euident, that our Lord sprung out of Iuda, concerning the which tribe Moses spake nothing, touching the Priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it is yet a more euident thing, because that after the similitude of Melchi-sedec, there is risen vp another Priest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Which is not made Priest after the Law of the carnal commandement, but after the power of the endlesse life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For hee testifieth thus, Thou art a Priest for euer, after the order of Melchi-sedec.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the commandement that went afore, is disanulled, because of the weakenes thereof, and vnprofitablenes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the Law made nothing perfite, but the bringing in of a better hope made perfite, whereby we drawe neere vnto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And for as much as it is not without an othe (for these are made Priestes without an othe:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But this is made with an othe by him that said vnto him, The Lord hath sworne, and will not repent, Thou art a Priest for euer, after the order of Melchi-sedec)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">By so much is Iesus made a suretie of a better Testament.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And among them many were made Priests, because they were not suffered to endure, by the reason of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But this man, because hee endureth euer, hath a Priesthood, which cannot passe from one to another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Wherefore, hee is able also perfectly to saue them that come vnto God by him, seeing he euer liueth, to make intercession for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For such an hie Priest it became vs to haue, which is holy, harmelesse, vndefiled, separate from sinners, and made hier then the heauens:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Which needeth not daily as those hie Priests to offer vp sacrifice, first for his owne sinnes, and then for the peoples: for that did he once, when he offered vp himselfe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the Law maketh men hie Priestes, which haue infirmitie: but the word of the othe that was since the Lawe, maketh the Sonne, who is consecrated for euermore.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Nowe of the things which we haue spoken, this is the summe, that wee haue such an hie Priest, that sitteth at the right hand of the throne of the Maiestie in heauens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And is a minister of the Sanctuarie, and of that true Tabernacle which the Lord pight, and not man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For euery high Priest is ordeined to offer both giftes and sacrifices: wherefore it was of necessitie, that this man shoulde haue somewhat also to offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For he were not a Priest, if he were on the earth, seeing there are Priestes that according to the Lawe offer giftes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Who serue vnto the paterne and shadowe of heauenly things, as Moses was warned by God, whe he was about to finish the Tabernacle. See, saide hee, that thou make all thinges according to the paterne, shewed to thee in the mount.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But nowe our hie Priest hath obteined a more excellent office, in as much as he is the Mediatour of a better Testament, which is established vpon better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if that first Testament had bene vnblameable, no place should haue bene sought for the second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For in rebuking them he saith, Beholde, the dayes will come, saith the Lord, when I shall make with the house of Israel, and with the house of Iuda a newe Testament:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Not like the Testament that I made with their fathers, in the day that I tooke them by the hand, to leade them out of the land of Egypt: for they continued not in my Testament, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For this is the Testament that I will make with the house of Israel, After those dayes, saith the Lord, I will put my Lawes in their minde, and in their heart I will write them, and I wil be their God, and they shalbe my people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they shall not teache euery man his neighbour and euery man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall knowe me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I will bee mercifull to their vnrighteousnes, and I wil remember their sinnes and their iniquities no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In that he saith a new Testament, he hath abrogate the olde: nowe that which is disanulled and waxed olde, is ready to vanish away.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the first Testament had also ordinances of religion, and a worldly Sanctuarie.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the first Tabernacle was made, wherein was the candlesticke, and the table, and the shewebread, which Tabernacle is called the Holy places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And after the seconde vaile was the Tabernacle, which is called the Holiest of all,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Which had the golden censer, and the Arke of the Testament ouerlayde rounde about with golde, wherein the golden pot, which had Manna, was, and Aarons rod that had budded, and the tables of the Testament.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And ouer the Arke were the glorious Cherubims, shadowing the mercie seat: of which things we will not nowe speake particularly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Nowe when these things were thus ordeined, the Priestes went alwayes into the first Tabernacle, and accomplished the seruice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But into the second went the hie Priest alone, once euery yere, not without blood which hee offered for himselfe, and for the ignorances of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Whereby the holy Ghost this signified, that the way into ye Holiest of all was not yet opened, while as yet the first tabernacle was standing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which was a figure for that present time, wherein were offred gifts and sacrifices that could not make holy, concerning the conscience, him that did the seruice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Which only stood in meates and drinkes, and diuers washings, and carnal rites, which were inioyned, vntill the time of reformation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Christ being come an high Priest of good things to come, by a greater and a more perfect Tabernacle, not made with handes, that is, not of this building,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Neither by the blood of goates and calues: but by his owne blood entred he in once vnto the holy place, and obteined eternall redemption for vs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of bulles and of goates, and the ashes of an heifer, sprinkling them that are vncleane, sanctifieth as touching the purifying of the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">How much more shall the blood of Christ which through the eternall Spirit offered himselfe without fault to God, purge your conscience from dead workes, to serue the liuing God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And for this cause is he the Mediatour of the newe Testament, that through death which was for the redemption of the transgressions that were in the former Testament, they which were called, might receiue the promise of eternall inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For where a Testament is, there must be the death of him that made the Testament.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the Testament is confirmed when men are dead: for it is yet of no force as long as he that made it, is aliue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Wherefore neither was the first ordeined without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For when Moses had spoken euery precept to the people, according to the Law, he tooke the blood of calues and of goates, with water and purple wooll and hyssope, and sprinckled both the booke, and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Saying, This is the blood of the Testament, which God hath appointed vnto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Moreouer, he sprinkled likewise the Tabernacle with blood also, and all the ministring vessels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And almost all things are by the Law purged with blood, and without sheading of blood is no remission.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It was then necessary, that the similitudes of heauenly things should be purified with such things: but the heauenly things them selues are purified with better sacrifices then are these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Christ is not entred into ye holy places that are made with hands, which are similitudes of ye true Sanctuarie: but is entred into very heauen, to appeare now in ye sight of God for vs,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Not that he should offer himselfe often, as the hie Priest entred into the Holy place euery yeere with other blood,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">(For then must he haue often suffred since the foundation of the world) but now in the end of the world hath he bene made manifest, once to put away sinne by the sacrifice of him selfe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as it is appointed vnto men that they shall once die, and after that commeth the iudgement:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Christ was once offered to take away the sinnes of many, and vnto them that looke for him, shall he appeare the second time without sinne vnto saluation.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For the Law hauing the shadowe of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can neuer with those sacrifices, which they offer yeere by yeere continually, sanctifie the commers thereunto.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For would they not then haue ceased to haue bene offered, because that the offerers once purged, should haue had no more conscience of sinnes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance againe of sinnes euery yeere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is vnpossible that the blood of bulles and goates should take away sinnes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Wherefore when he commeth into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offring thou wouldest not: but a body hast thou ordeined me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In burnt offerings, and sinne offrings thou hast had no pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I sayd, Lo, I come (In the beginning of the booke it is written of me) that I should doe thy will, O God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Aboue, when he sayd, Sacrifice and offring, and burnt offrings, and sinne offrings thou wouldest not haue, neither hadst pleasure therein (which are offered by the Lawe)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">By the which wil we are sanctified, euen by the offring of the body of Iesus Christ once made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And euery Priest standeth dayly ministring, and oft times offreth one maner of offring, which can neuer take away sinnes:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And from hencefoorth tarieth, till his enemies be made his footestoole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For with one offering hath he consecrated for euer them that are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For the holy Ghost also beareth vs record: for after that he had sayd before,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This is the Testament that I will make vnto them after those dayes, sayth the Lord, I wil put my Lawes in their heart, and in their mindes I will write them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And their sinnes and iniquities will I remember no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Nowe where remission of these things is, there is no more offering for sinne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Seeing therefore, brethren, that by the blood of Iesus we may be bolde to enter into the Holy place,</VERS>
