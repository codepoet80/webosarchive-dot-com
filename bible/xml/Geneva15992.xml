    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Salomon the sonne of Dauid was confirmed in his kingdome: and the Lord his God was with him, and magnified him highly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Salomon spake vnto all Israel, to the captaines of thousandes, and of hundreths, and to the iudges, and to all the gouernours in all Israel, euen the chiefe fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Salomon and all the Congregation with him went to the hie place that was at Gibeon: for there was the Tabernacle of the Congregation of God which Moses the seruant of the Lord had made in the wildernesse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the Arke of God had Dauid brought vp from Kiriath-iearim, when Dauid had made preparation for it: for he had pitched a tent for it in Ierusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreouer the brasen altar that Bezaleel the sonne of Vri, the sonne of Hur had made, did hee set before the Tabernacle of the Lord: and Salomon and the Congregation sought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Salomon offred there before the Lord vpon the brasen altar that was in the Tabernacle of the Congregation: euen a thousand burnt offrings offred he vpon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The same night did God appeare vnto Salomon, and sayde vnto him, Aske what I shall giue thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Salomon sayde vnto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy vnto Dauid my father and hast made me to reigne in his stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nowe therefore, O Lord God, let thy promise vnto Dauid my father be true: for thou hast made mee King ouer a great people, like to the dust of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Giue me now wisdome and knowledge, that I may go out and go in before this people: for who can iudge this thy great people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God sayde to Salomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, treasures nor honour, nor the liues of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life, but hast asked for thee wisdome and knowledge that thou mightest iudge my people, ouer whome I haue made thee King,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Wisdome and knowledge is granted vnto thee, and I will giue thee riches and treasures and honour, so that there hath not bene the like among the Kings which were before thee, neither after thee shall there be the like.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Salomon came from the hie place, that was at Gibeon, to Ierusalem from before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and reigned ouer Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Salomon gathered the charets and horesemen: and he had a thousand and foure hundreth charets, and twelue thousande horsemen, whome he placed in the charet cities, and with the King at Ierusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the King gaue siluer and gold at Ierusalem as stones, and gaue cedar trees as the wilde figge trees, that are abundantly in the playne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Also Salomon had horses brought out of Egypt and fine linen: the Kings marchants receiued the fine linen for a price.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They came vp also and brought out of Egypt some charet, worth sixe hundreth shekels of siluer, that is an horse for an hundreth and fiftie: and thus they brought horses to all the Kings of the Hittites, and to the Kings of Aram by their meanes.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Salomon determined to builde an house for the Name of the Lord, and an house for his kingdome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Salomon tolde out seuentie thousand that bare burdens, and fourescore thousande men to hewe stones in the mountaine, and three thousand and sixe hundreth to ouersee them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Salomon sent to Huram the king of Tyrus, saying, As thou hast done to Dauid my father, and didst sende him cedar trees to buylde him an house to dwell in, so do to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold, I buylde an house vnto the Name of the Lord my God, to sanctifie it vnto him, and to burne sweete incense before him, and for the continuall shewbread, and for the burnt offrings of the morning and euening, on the Sabbath dayes, and in the new moneths, and in the solemne feastes of the Lord our God: this is a perpetuall thing for Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the house which I buylde, is great: for great is our God aboue all gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Who is he then that can be able to buylde him an house, when the heauen, and the heauen of heauens can not conteine him? who am I then that I should buylde him an house? but I do it to burne incense before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Sende me nowe therefore a cunning man that can worke in golde, in siluer, and in brasse, and in yron, and in purple, and crimosin and blue silke, and that can graue in grauen worke with the cunning men that are with me in Iudah and in Ierusalem, whom Dauid my father hath prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Sende mee also cedar trees, firre trees and Algummim trees from Lebanon: for I knowe that thy seruants can skill to hewe timber in Lebanon: and beholde, my seruantes shalbe with thine,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That they may prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I doe buylde, is great and wonderfull.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And behold, I will giue to thy seruants the cutters and the hewers of timber twentie thousand measures of beaten wheate, and twentie thousand measures of barley, and twentie thousand baths of wine, and twentie thousand baths of oyle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Huram King of Tyrus answered in writing which he sent to Salomon, Because the Lord hath loued his people, he hath made thee King ouer them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Huram sayd moreouer, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which made the heauen and the earth, and that hath giuen vnto Dauid the King a wise sonne, that hath discretion, prudence and vnderstanding to buylde an house for the Lord, and a palace for his kingdome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now therefore I haue sent a wise man, and of vnderstanding of my father Hurams,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The sonne of a woman of the daughters of Dan: and his father was a man of Tyrus, and he can skill to worke in golde, in siluer, in brasse, in yron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue silke, and in fine linen, and in crimosin, and can graue in all grauen workes, and broyder in all broydered worke that shalbe giuen him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord Dauid thy father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore the wheate and the barley, the oyle and the wine, which my lorde hath spoken of, let him send vnto his seruants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And we wil cut wood in Lebanon as much as thou shalt neede, and will bring it to thee in raftes by the sea to Iapho, so thou mayest cary them to Ierusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Salomon nombred al the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the nombring that his father Dauid had nombred them: and they were found an hundreth and three and fiftie thousand, and sixe hundreth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he set seuentie thousande of them to the burden, and fourescore thousande to hewe stones in the mountaine, and three thousande and sixe hundreth ouerseers to cause the people to worke.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So Salomon began to buyld the house of the Lord in Ierusalem, in mount Moriah which had bene declared vnto Dauid his father, in the place that Dauid prepared in the thresshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he beganne to buylde in the seconde moneth and the second day, in the fourth yeere of his reigne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And these are the measures, whereon Salomon grounded to buylde the house of God: the length of cubites after the first measure was threescore cubites, and the breadth twenty cubites:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the porch, that was before the length in the front of the breadth was twentie cubits, and the height was an hundreth and twentie, and he ouerlayd it within with pure golde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the greater house he sieled with firre tree which he ouerlayd with good golde, and graued thereon palme trees and chaines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And hee ouerlayde the house with precious stone for beautie: and the golde was gold of Paruaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The house, I say, the beames, postes, and walles thereof and the doores thereof ouerlayde he with gold, and graued Cherubims vpon the walles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He made also the house of the most holy place: the length thereof was in the front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twentie cubites: and he ouerlayde it with the best golde, of sixe hundreth talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the weight of the nayles was fiftie shekels of golde, and hee ouerlayde the chambers with golde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And in the house of the most holy place he made two Cherubims wrought like children, and ouerlayd them with golde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the winges of the Cherubims were twentie cubites long: the one wing was fiue cubites, reaching to the wall of the house, and the other wing fiue cubites, reaching to the wing of the other Cherub.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Likewise the wing of ye other Cherub was fiue cubites, reaching to the wall of the house, and the other wing fiue cubites ioyning to the wing of the other Cherub.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The wings of these Cherubims were spread abroade twentie cubites: they stoode on their feete, and their faces were toward the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He made also the vaile of blew silke and purple, and crimosin, and fine linen, and wrought Cherubims thereon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he made before the house two pillars of fiue and thirtie cubites hie: and the chapiter that was vpon the top of eche of them, was fiue cubites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He made also chaines for the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars, and made an hundreth pomegranates, and put them among the chaines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he set vp the pillars before the Temple, one on the right hande and the other on the left, and called that on the right hand Iachin, and that on the left hand Boaz.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And hee made an altar of brasse twentie cubites long, and twentie cubites broade, and ten cubites hie.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he made a molten Sea of ten cubites from brim to brim, rounde in compasse, and fiue cubites hie: and a line of thirtie cubites did compasse it about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And vnder it was ye facion of oxen, which did compasse it rounde about, tenne in a cubite compassing the Sea about: two rowes of oxen were cast when it was molten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It stoode vpon twelue oxen: three looked toward the North, and three looked towarde the West, and three looked towarde the South, and three looked towarde the East, and the Sea stoode about vpon them, and all their hinder parts were inwarde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the thickenesse thereof was an hande breadth, and the brim thereof was like the worke of the brim of a cuppe with floures of lilies: it conteined three thousand baths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He made also ten caldrons, and put fiue on the right hand, and fiue on the left, to wash in them, and to clense in them that which apperteined to the burnt offrings: but the Sea was for the Priests to wash in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he made ten candlestickes of golde (according to their forme) and put them in the Temple, fiue on the right hand, and fiue on the left.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And Huram made pottes and besoms and basens, and Huram finished the worke that hee shoulde make for King Salomon for the house of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">To wit, two pillars, and the bowles and the chapiters on the top of ye two pillars, and two grates to couer the two bowles of the chapiters which were vpon the toppe of the pillars:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And foure hundreth pomegranates for the two grates, two rowes of pomegranates for euery grate to couer the two bowles of the chapiters, that were vpon the pillars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He made also bases, and made caldrons vpon the bases:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And a Sea, and twelue bulles vnder it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Pottes also and besomes, and fleshhookes, and all these vessels made Huram his father, to King Salomon for the house of the Lord, of shining brasse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In the playne of Iorden did the King cast them in clay betweene Succoth and Zeredathah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Salomon made al these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of brasse could not be rekoned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Salomon made al the vessels that were for the house of God: the golden altar also and the tables, whereon the shewbread stoode.</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So was all the worke finished that Salomon made for the house of the Lord, and Salomon brought in the things that Dauid his father had dedicated, with the siluer and the golde, and all the vessels, and put them among the treasures of the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Salomon assembled the Elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chiefe fathers of the children of Israel vnto Ierusalem to bring vp the Arke of the couenant of the Lord from the citie of Dauid, which is Zion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And all ye men of Israel assembled vnto the King at the feast: it was in ye seuenth moneth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And all the Elders of Israel came, and the Leuites tooke vp the Arke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they caried vp the Arke and the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and all the holy vessels that were in the Tabernacle, those did the Priests and Leuites bring vp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And King Salomon and all the Congregation of Israel that were assembled vnto him, were before ye Arke, offring sheepe and bullocks, which could not be told nor nobred for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So the Priests brought the Arke of the couenant of the Lord vnto his place, into the Oracle of the house, into the most Holy place, euen vnder the wings of the Cherubims.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For ye Cherubims stretched out their wings ouer the place of the Arke, and the Cherubims couered the Arke and the barres thereof aboue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they drewe out the barres, that the endes of the barres might bee seene out of the Arke before the Oracle, but they were not seene without: and there they are vnto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Nothing was in the Arke, saue the two Tables, which Moses gaue at Horeb, where the Lord made a couenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when the Priestes were come out of the Sanctuarie (for all the Priests that were present, were sanctified and did not waite by course.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And the King turned his face, and blessed all the Congregation of Israel (for all the Congregation of Israel stoode there)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spake with his mouth vnto Dauid my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no citie of al the tribes of Israel to buylde an house, that my Name might be there, neyther chose I any man to be a ruler ouer my people Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I haue chosen Ierusalem, that my Name might be there, and haue chosen Dauid to be ouer my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it was in the heart of Dauid my father to builde an house vnto the Name of the Lord God of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But the Lord sayde to Dauid my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to buylde an house vnto my Name, thou diddest well, that thou wast so minded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house, but thy sonne which shall come out of thy loynes, he shall buylde an house vnto my Name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the Lord hath performed his worde that he spake: and I am risen vp in the roume of Dauid my father, and am set on the throne of Israel as the Lord promised, and haue built an house to the Name of the Lord God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I haue set the Arke there, wherein is the couenant of the Lord, that he made with the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the King stoode before the altar of the Lord, in the presence of all the Congregation of Israel, and stretched out his hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">(For Salomon had made a brasen skaffold and set it in the middes of the court, of fiue cubites long, and fiue cubites broade, and three cubites of height, and vpon it he stoode, and kneeled downe vpon his knees before all the Congregation of Israel, and stretched out his hands toward heauen)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And sayd, O Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heauen nor in earth, which keepest couenant, and mercie vnto thy seruants, that walke before thee with all their heart.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Came Hanam, one of my brethren, he and the men of Iudah, and I asked them concerning the Iewes that were deliuered, which were of the residue of the captiuitie, and concerning Ierusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they sayde vnto me, The residue that are left of the captiuitie there in the prouince, are in great affliction and in reproche, and the wall of Ierusalem is broken downe, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when I heard these wordes, I sate downe and wept, and mourned certeine dayes, and I fasted and prayed before the God of heauen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And sayde, O Lord God of heauen, the great and terrible God, that keepeth couenant and mercy for them that loue him, and obserue his commandements,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I pray thee, let thine eares be attet, and thine eies open, to heare the praier of thy seruat, which I pray before thee dayly, day and night for ye childre of Israel thy seruats, and confesse the sinnes of the children of Israel, which we haue sinned against thee, both I and my fathers house haue sinned:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">I beseeche thee, remember the worde that thou commandedst thy seruant Moses, saying, Ye wil transgresse, and I will scatter you abroade among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if ye turne vnto me, and keepe my commandements, and doe them, though your scattering were to the vttermost part of the heauen, yet will I gather you from thence, and will bring you vnto the place that I haue chosen to place my Name there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now these are thy seruants and thy people, whome thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy mightie hand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Woe vnto them that goe downe into Egypt for helpe, and stay vpon horses, and trust in charets, because they are many, and in horsemen, because they be very strong: but they looke not vnto the holy one of Israel, nor seeke vnto the Lord.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="36">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Nowe in the fourteenth yeere of King Hezekiah, Saneherib King of Asshur came vp against al the strong cities of Iudah, and tooke them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the King of Asshur sent Rabshakeh from Lachish toward Ierusalem vnto King Hezekiah, with a great hoste, and he stood by ye conduite of the vpper poole in the path of the fullers fielde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then came foorth vnto him Eliakim the sonne of Hilkiah the steward of the house, and Shebna the chanceler, and Ioah the sonne of Asaph the recorder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Rabshakeh sayde vnto them, Tell you Hezekiah, I pray you, Thus sayth the great King, the King of Asshur, What confidence is this, wherein thou trustest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I say, Surely I haue eloquence, but counsell and strength are for the warre: on whom then doest thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Loe, thou trustest in this broken staffe of reede on Egypt, whereupon if a man leane, it will goe into his hand, and pearce it: so is Pharaoh King of Egypt, vnto all that trust in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if thou say to me, We trust in the Lord our God. Is not that he, whose hie places and whose altars Hezekiah tooke downe, and said to Iudah and to Ierusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nowe therefore giue hostages to my lorde the King of Asshur, and I wil giue thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders vpon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For howe canst thou despise any captaine of the least of my lordes seruants? and put thy trust on Egypt for charets and for horsemen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And am I now come vp without the Lord to this land to destroy it? The Lord sayd vnto me, Goe vp against this land and destroy it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then sayd Eliakim and Shebna and Ioah vnto Rabshakeh, Speake, I pray thee, to thy seruants in the Aramites language, (for we vnderstand it) and talke not with vs in the Iewes tongue, in the audience of the people that are on the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said Rabshakeh, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee to speake these wordes, and not to the men that sit on the wall? that they may eate their owne doung, and drinke their owne pisse with you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Rabshakeh stood, and cryed with a loude voyce in the Iewes language, and sayd, Heare the wordes of the great King, of the King of Asshur.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Thus saith the King, Let not Hezekiah deceiue you: for he shall not be able to deliuer you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Neither let Hezekiah make you to trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord will surely deliuer vs: this citie shall not be giuen ouer into the hand of the King of Asshur.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus sayth the King of Asshur, Make appointment with me, and come out to me, that euery man may eate of his owne vine, and euery man of his owne fig tree, and drinke euery man the water of his owne well,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Till I come and bring you to a land like your owne land, euen a land of wheate, and wine, a land of bread and vineyardes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Least Hezekiah deceiue you, saying, The Lord wil deliuer vs. Hath any of the gods of the nations deliuered his land out of the hand of the King of Asshur?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Where is the god of Hamath, and of Arpad? where is the god of Sepharuaim? or howe haue they deliuered Samaria out of mine hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Who is hee among all the gods of these lands, that hath deliuered their countrey out of mine hand, that the Lord should deliuer Ierusalem out of mine hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then they kept silence, and answered him not a worde: for the Kings commandement was, saying, Answere him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then came Eliakim the sonne of Hilkiah the steward of the house, and Shebna the chanceller, and Ioah the sonne of Asaph the recorder, vnto Hezekiah with rent clothes, and tolde him the wordes of Rabshakeh.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="37">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when the King Hezekiah heard it, he rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth and came into the House of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he sent Eliakim the stewarde of the house, aud Shebna the chanceller, with the Elders of the Priestes, clothed in sackcloth vnto Isaiah the Prophet, the sonne of Amoz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they sayd vnto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of tribulation and of rebuke and blasphemie: for the children are come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring foorth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If so be the Lord thy God hath heard the wordes of Rabshakeh, whom the King of Asshur his master hath sent to raile on the liuing God, and to reproch him with wordes which the Lord thy God hath heard, then lift thou vp thy prayer for the remnant that are left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So the seruants of the King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Isaiah sayde vnto them, Thus say vnto your master, Thus saith the Lord, Be not afrayd of the wordes that thou hast heard, wherewith the seruants of the king of Asshur haue blasphemed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Beholde, I wil send a blast vpon him, and he shall heare a noyse, and returne to his owne land, and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his owne land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Rabshakeh returned, and found the King of Asshur fighting against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He heard also men say of Tirhakah, King of Ethiopia, Beholde, he is come out to fight against thee: and when he heard it, he sent other messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus shall ye speake to Hezekiah King of Iudah, saying, Let not thy God deceiue thee, in whom thou trustest, saying, Ierusalem shall not be giuen into the hand of the King of Asshur.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Beholde, thou hast heard what the Kings of Asshur haue done to all lands in destroying them, and shalt thou be deliuered?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Haue the gods of the nations deliuered them, which my fathers haue destroyed? as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden, which were at Telassar?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Where is the King of Hamath, and the King of Arpad, and the King of the citie of Sepharuaim, Hena and Iuah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So Hezekiah receiued the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went vp into the House of the Lord, and Hezekiah spread it before the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Hezekiah prayed vnto the Lord, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">O Lord of hostes, God of Israel, which dwellest betweene the Cherubims, thou art very God alone ouer all the kingdomes of the earth: thou hast made the heauen and the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Encline thine eare, O Lord, and heare: open thine eyes, O Lord, and see, and heare all the wordes of Saneherib, who hath sent to blaspheme the liuing God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Trueth it is, O Lord, that the Kings of Asshur haue destroyed all lands, and their countrey,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And haue cast their gods in ye fire: for they were no gods, but the worke of mans hands, euen wood or stone: therefore they destroyed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Nowe therefore, O Lord our God, saue thou vs out of his hand, that all the kingdomes of the earth may knowe, that thou onely art the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Isaiah the sonne of Amoz sent vnto Hezekiah, saying, Thus sayth the Lord God of Israel, Because thou hast prayed vnto me, concerning Saneherib king of Asshur,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">This is the worde that the Lord hath spoken against him, the virgine, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorne: the daughter of Ierusalem, hath shaken her head at thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Whome hast thou railed on and blasphemed? and against whome hast thou exalted thy voyce, and lifted vp thine eyes on hie? euen against the holy one of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">By thy seruants hast thou railed on the Lord, and sayd, By the multitude of my charets I am come vp to the top of the mountaines to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut downe the hie cedars thereof, and the faire firre trees thereof, and I will goe vp to the heightes of his top and to the forest of his fruitfull places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I haue digged and drunke the waters, and with the plant of my feete haue I dryed all the riuers closed in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Hast thou not heard howe I haue of olde time made it, and haue formed it long ago? and should I now bring it, that it should be destroyed, and layde on ruinous heapes, as cities defensed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Whose inhabitants haue small power, and are afrayd and confounded: they are like the grasse of the field and greene herbe, or grasse on the house tops, or corne blassed afore it be growen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But I know thy dwelling, and thy going out, and thy comming in, and thy fury against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Because thou ragest against me, and thy tumult is come vnto mine eares, therefore will I put mine hooke in thy nostrels, and my bridle in thy lips, and wil bring thee backe againe the same way thou camest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And this shalbe a signe vnto thee, O Hezekiah, Thou shalt eate this yeere such as groweth of it selfe: and the second yeere, such things as growe without sowing: and in the third yeere, sowe ye and reape, and plant vineyards, and eate the fruite thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Iudah, shall againe take roote downward and beare fruite vpward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For out of Ierusalem shall goe a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeale of the Lord of hostes shall doe this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore thus sayth the Lord, concerning the King of Asshur, He shall not enter into this citie, nor shoote an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a mount against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">By the same way that he came, he shall returne, and not come into this citie, saith the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For I will defend this citie to saue it, for mine owne sake, and for my seruant Dauids sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then the Angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the campe of Asshur an hundreth, fourescore, and fiue thousand: so when they arose early in the morning, beholde, they were all dead corpses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So Saneherib king of Asshur departed, and went away and returned and dwelt at Nineueh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And as he was in the temple worshipping of Nisroch his god, Adramelech and Sharezer his sonnes slewe him with the sword, and they escaped into the land of Ararat: and Esarhaddon his sonne reigned in his steade.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="38">
      <VERS vnumber="1">About that time was Hezekiah sicke vnto the death, and the Prophet Isaiah sonne of Amoz came vnto him, and sayd vnto him, Thus sayth the Lord, Put thine house in an order, for thou shalt dye, and not liue.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Then came the worde of the Lord vnto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Sonne of man, speake vnto the Elders of Israel, and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Are ye come to enquire of me? as I liue, sayth the Lord God, when I am asked, I wil not answer you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Wilt thou iudge them, sonne of man? wilt thou iudge them? cause them to vnderstand the abominations of their fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, In the day when I chose Israel, and lift vp mine hand vnto the seede of the house of Iaakob, and made my selfe knowen vnto them in the land of Egypt, when I lift vp mine hand vnto them, and sayd, I am the Lord your God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In the day that I lift vp mine hand vnto them to bring them forth of the land of Egypt, into a land that I had prouided for them, flowing with milke and hony which is pleasant among all lands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then sayd I vnto them, Let euery man cast away the abominations of his eyes, and defile not your selues with the idols of Egypt: for I am the Lord your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But they rebelled against me, and would not heare me: for none cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idoles of Egypt: then I thought to powre out mine indignation vpon them, and to accomplish my wrath against them in the mids of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But I had respect to my Name, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whome they were, and in whose sight I made my selfe knowen vnto them in bringing them forth of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Nowe I caried them out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wildernes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I gaue them my statutes, and declared my iudgements vnto them, which if a man doe, he shall liue in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Moreouer I gaue them also my Sabbaths to be a signe betweene me and them, that they might knowe that I am the Lord, that sanctifie them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wildernes: they walked not in my statutes, and they cast away my iudgements, which if a man doe, he shall liue in them, and my Sabbaths haue they greatly polluted: then I thought to powre out mine indignation vpon them in the wildernes to consume them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But I had respect to my Name, that it shoulde not bee polluted before the heathen in whose sight I brought them out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yet neuerthelesse, I lift vp mine hande vnto them in the wildernes that I would not bring them into the lande, which I had giuen them, flowing with milke and hony, which was pleasant aboue all landes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Because they cast away my iudgments, and walked not in my statutes, but haue polluted my Sabbaths: for their heart went after their idoles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Neuerthelesse, mine eye spared them, that I would not destroye them, neither would I consume them in the wildernes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But I said vnto their children in the wildernes, Walke ye not in the ordinances of your fathers, neither obserue their maners, nor defile your selues with their idoles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I am the Lord your God: walke in my statutes, and keepe my iudgements and doe them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And sanctifie my Sabbaths, and they shall bee a signe betweene mee and you, that ye may knowe that I am the Lord your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Notwithstanding the children rebelled against mee: they walked not in my statutes, nor kept my iudgements to doe them, which if a man doe, hee shall liue in them, but they polluted my Sabbaths: then I thought to powre out mine indignation vpon them, and to accomplish my wrath against them in the wildernes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Neuerthelesse I withdrew mine hand and had respect to my Name that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them foorth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Yet I lift vp mine hande vnto them in the wildernes, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countreys,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Because they had not executed my iudgements, but had cast away my statutes and had polluted my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers idoles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Wherefore I gaue them also statutes that were not good, and iudgements, wherein they should not liue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And I polluted them in their owne giftes in that they caused to passe by the fire all that first openeth ye wombe, that I might destroy them, to the ende, that they might know that I am ye Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore, sonne of man, speake vnto the house of Israel, and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Yet in this your fathers haue blasphemed me, though they had before grieuously transgressed against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted vp mine hand to giue it to them, then they saw euery hie hill, and all the thicke trees, and they offred there their sacrifices, and there they presented their offering of prouocation: there also they made their sweete sauour, and powred out there their drinke offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then I saide vnto them, What is the hie place whereunto ye goe? And the name thereof was called Bamah vnto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Wherefore, say vnto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, Are ye not polluted after the maner of your fathers? and commit ye not whoredome after their abominations?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For when you offer your giftes, and make your sonnes to passe through the fire, you pollute your selues with all your idoles vnto this day: shall I answere you when I am asked, O house of Israel? As I liue, saith the Lord God, I wil not answere you when I am asked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Neither shall that be done that commeth into your minde: for ye say, We wil be as the heathen, and as the families of the countreys, and serue wood, and stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">As I liue, saith the Lord God, I will surely rule you with a mightie hand, and with a stretched out arme, and in my wrath powred out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And will bring you from the people, and will gather you out of the countreys, wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arme, and in my wrath powred out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And I will bring you into the wildernes of the people, and there wil I pleade with you face to face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wildernes of the lande of Egypt, so will I pleade with you, saith the Lord God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And I wil cause you to passe vnder the rod, and wil bring you into the bond of the couenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And I wil chuse out from among you the rebels, and them that transgresse against mee: I will bring them out of the land where they dwel, and they shall not enter into the lande of Israel, and you shall knowe that I am the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord God, Goe you, and serue euery one his idole, seeing that ye will not obey me, and pollute mine holy Name no more with your giftes and with your idoles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For in mine holy mountaine, euen in the hie mountaine of Israel, saith the Lord God, there shall all the house of Israel, and all in the lande, serue me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offrings and the first fruites of your oblations, with all your holy things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">I will accept your sweete sauour, when I bring you from the people, and gather you out of the countreys, wherein ye haue bene scattered, that I may be sanctified in you before ye heathen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And ye shall knowe, that I am the Lord, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the land, for the which I lifted vp mine hande to giue it to your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And there shall ye remember your wayes, and all your workes, wherein ye haue bene defiled, and ye shall iudge your selues worthy to be cut off, for all your euils, that ye haue committed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And ye shall knowe, that I am the Lord, when I haue respect vnto you for my Names sake, and not after your wicked wayes, nor according to your corrupt workes, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Moreouer, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Sonne of man, set thy face toward the way of Teman, and drop thy word toward the South, and prophecie towarde the forest of the fielde of the South,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And say to the forest of the South, Heare the worde of the Lord: thus saith the Lord God, Beholde, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall deuoure all the greene wood in thee, and all the drie wood: the continuall flame shall not bee quenched, and euery face from the South to the North shall be burnt therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And all flesh shall see, that I the Lord haue kindled it, and it shall not bee quenched. Then saide I, Ah Lord God, they say of me, Doeth not he speake parables?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of ye Lord came to me againe, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Seeing then that I will cut off from thee both the righteous and wicked, therefore shall my sworde goe out of his sheath against all flesh from the South to the North,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That all flesh may knowe that I the Lord haue drawen my sworde out of his sheath, and it shall not returne any more.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The worde of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Sonne of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they committed fornication in Egypt, they committed fornication in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teates of their virginitie.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sonnes and daughters: thus were their names. Samaria is Aholah, and Ierusalem Aholibah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine, and she was set on fire with her louers, to wit, with the Assyrians her neighbours,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Which were clothed with blewe silke, both captaines and princes: they were all pleasant yong men, and horsemen riding vpon horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Thus she committed her whoredome with them, euen with all them that were the chosen men of Asshur, and with all on whome she doted, and defiled her selfe with all their idoles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Neither left she her fornications, learned of the Egyptians: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginitie, and powred their whoredome vpon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore I deliuered her into the hands of her louers, euen into the hands of the Assyrians, vpon whome she doted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">These discouered her shame: they tooke away her sonnes and her daughters, and slewe her with the sworde, and she had an euill name among women: for they had executed iudgement vpon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when her sister Aholibah sawe this, she marred her selfe with inordinate loue, more then she, and with her fornications more then her sister with her fornications.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She doted vpon the Assyrians her neighbours, both captaines and princes clothed with diuers sutes, horsemen ryding vpon horses: they were all pleasant yong men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I sawe that she was defiled, and that they were both after one sort,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And that she encreased her fornications: for when she sawe men painted vpon the wall, the images of the Caldeans painted with vermelon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And girded with girdles vpon their loynes, and with dyed attyre vpon their heads (looking all like princes after the maner of the Babylonians in Caldea, the land of their natiuitie)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Assoone, I say, as she sawe them, she doted vpon them, and sent messengers vnto them into Caldea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Nowe when the Babylonians came to her into the bed of loue, they defiled her with their fornication, and she was polluted with them, and her lust departed from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So she discouered her fornication, and disclosed her shame: then mine heart forsooke her, like as mine heart had forsaken her sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet she encreased her whoredome more, and called to remembrance ye dayes of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For she doted vpon their seruants whose members are as the members of asses, and whose yssue is like the yssue of horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Thou calledst to remembrance the wickednes of thy youth, when thy teates were bruised by ye Egyptians: therefore ye paps of thy youth are thus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore, O Aholibah, thus sayeth the Lord God, Beholde, I will raise vp thy louers against thee, from whome thine heart is departed, and I will bring them against thee on euery side,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">To wit, the Babylonians, and all the Caldeans, Peked, and Shoah, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: they were all pleasant yong men, captaines and princes: all they were valiant and renoumed, riding vpon horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Euen these shall come against thee with charets, waggons, and wheeles, and with a multitude of people, which shall set against thee, buckler and shield, and helmet round about: and I will leaue the punishment vnto them, and they shall iudge thee according to their iudgements.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And I wil lay mine indignation vpon thee, and they shall deale cruelly with thee: they shall cut off thy nose and thine eares, and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall cary away thy sonnes and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be deuoured by the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fayre iewels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Thus wil I make thy wickednes to cease from thee and thy fornication out of the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift vp thine eyes vnto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I wil deliuer thee into the hand of them, whome thou hatest: euen into the hands of them from whome thine heart is departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And they shall handle thee despitefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leaue thee naked and bare, and the shame of thy fornications shalbe discouered, both thy wickednes, and thy whoredome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I wil doe these things vnto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idoles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister: therefore wil I giue her cup into thine hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Thus saith ye Lord God, Thou shalt drinke of thy sisters cup, deepe and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorne and had in derision, because it containeth much.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">But I will put hookes in thy chawes, and I will cause the fish of thy riuers to sticke vnto thy scales, and I will drawe thee out of the middes of thy riuers, and all the fishe of thy riuers shall sticke vnto thy scales.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I will leaue thee in the wildernes, both thee and al the fish of thy riuers: thou shalt fal vpon ye open field: thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: for I haue giue thee for meat to the beasts of the field, and to the foules of heauen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And al the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord, because they haue ben a staffe of reede to the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When they tooke holde of thee with their hand, thou diddest breake, and rent all their shoulder: and when they leaned vpon thee, thou brakest and madest all their loynes to stand vpright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore thus sayeth the Lord God, Beholde, I will bring a sworde vpon thee, and destroy man and beast out of thee,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Sonne of man, speake vnto Pharaoh King of Egypt, and to his multitude, Whom art thou like in thy greatnesse?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Beholde, Asshur was like a cedar in Lebanon with faire branches, and with thicke shadowing boughes, and shot vp very hye, and his toppe was among the thicke boughes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The waters nourished him, and the deepe exalted him on hie with her riuers running round about his plants, and sent out her litle riuers vnto all the trees of the fielde.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore his height was exalted aboue all the trees of the fielde, and his boughes were multiplied, and his branches were long, because of the multitude of the waters, which the deepe sent out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">All the foules of the heauen made their nestes in his boughes, and vnder his branches did all the beastes of the fielde bring foorth their yong, and vnder his shadowe dwelt all mightie nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Thus was he faire in his greatnesse, and in the length of his branches: for his roote was neere great waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The cedars in the garden of God coulde not hide him: no firre tree was like his branches, and the chessenut trees were not like his boughes: all the trees in the garden of God were not like vnto him in his beautie.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I made him faire by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, enuied him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore thus sayeth the Lord God, Because he is lift vp on high, and hath shot vp his toppe among the thicke boughes, and his heart is lift vp in his height,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And the strangers haue destroyed him, euen the terrible nations, and they haue left him vpon the mountaines, and in all the valleis his branches are fallen, and his boughes are broken by all the riuers of the land: and all the people of the earth are departed from his shadowe, and haue forsaken him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Vpon his ruine shall all the foules of the heauen remaine, and all the beastes of the fielde shall be vpon his branches,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So that none of all the trees by the waters shalbe exalted by their height, neither shall shoote vp their toppe among the thicke boughes, neither shall their leaues stand vp in their height, which drinke so much water: for they are all deliuered vnto death in the nether partes of the earth in the middes of the children of men among them that goe downe to the pit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Thus saith the Lord God, In the day when he went downe to hell, I caused them to mourne, and I couered the deepe for him, and I did restreine the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: I caused Lebanon to mourne for him, and all the trees of the fielde fainted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him downe to hell with them that descend into the pit, and all the excellent trees of Eden, and the best of Lebanon: euen all that are nourished with waters, shall be comforted in the nether partes of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They also went downe to hell with him vnto them that be slaine with the sworde, and his arme, and they that dwelt vnder his shadowe in the middes of the heathen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">To whom art thou thus like in glorie and in greatnesse among the trees of Eden? yet thou shalt be cast downe with the trees of Eden vnto the nether partes of the earth: thou shalt sleepe in the middes of the vncircumcised, with them that be slaine by the sworde: this is Pharaoh and all his multitude, sayth the Lord God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Again, the woorde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Sonne of man, speake to the children of thy people, and say vnto them, When I bring the sworde vpon a lande, if the people of the lande take a man from among them, and make him their watchman,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If when hee seeth the sworde come vpon ye land, he blow the trumpet, and warne the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then hee that heareth the sounde of the trumpet, and will not bee warned, if the sworde come, and take him away, his blood shall be vpon his owne head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For he heard the sound of the trumpet, and woulde not bee admonished: therefore his blood shall be vpon him: but he that receiueth warning, shall saue his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if the watchman see the sworde come, and blowe not the trumpet, and the people be not warned: if the sworde come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away for his iniquitie, but his blood will I require at the watchmans hande.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore thou sonne of man, saye vnto the children of thy people, The righteousnesse of the righteous shall not deliuer him in the day of his transgression, nor the wickednesse of the wicked shall cause him to fall therein, in the day that he returneth from his wickednesse, neither shall the righteous liue for his righteousnesse in the day that he sinneth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When I shall say vnto the righteous, that he shall surely liue, if he trust to his owne righteousnes, and commit iniquitie, all his righteousnes shall be no more remembred, but for his iniquitie that he hath committed, he shall die for the same.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">For they come vnto thee, as the people vseth to come: and my people sit before thee, and heare thy wordes, but they will not doe them: for with their mouthes they make iestes, and their heart goeth after their couetousnesse.</VERS>
