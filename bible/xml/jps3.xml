    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THE PROVERBS of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To know wisdom and instruction; to comprehend the words of understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">To receive the discipline of wisdom, justice, and right, and equity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">To give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning, and the man of understanding may attain unto wise counsels;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">To understand a proverb, and a figure; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; but the foolish despise wisdom and discipline.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If they say: 'Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us lurk for the innocent without cause;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Let us swallow them up alive as the grave, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse'--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">My son, walk not thou in the way with them, restrain thy foot from their path;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For in vain the net is spread in the eyes of any bird;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And these lie in wait for their own blood, they lurk for their own lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; it taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wisdom crieth aloud in the streets, she uttereth her voice in the broad places;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She calleth at the head of the noisy streets, at the entrances of the gates, in the city, she uttereth her words:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">'How long, ye thoughtless, will ye love thoughtlessness? And how long will scorners delight them in scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Turn you at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man attended,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I also, in your calamity, will laugh, I will mock when your dread cometh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When your dread cometh as a storm, and your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; when trouble and distress come upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then will they call me, but I will not answer, they will seek me earnestly, but they shall not find me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the waywardness of the thoughtless shall slay them, and the confidence of fools shall destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, and shall be quiet without fear of evil.'</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and lay up my commandments with thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So that thou make thine ear attend unto wisdom, and thy heart incline to discernment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yea, if thou call for understanding, and lift up thy voice for discernment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If thou seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the LORD giveth wisdom, out of His mouth cometh knowledge and discernment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright, He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That He may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of His godly ones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, and equity, yea, every good path.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Discretion shall watch over thee, discernment shall guard thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the men that speak froward things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of evil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Who are crooked in their ways, and perverse in their paths;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the alien woman that maketh smooth her words;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">That forsaketh the lord of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For her house sinketh down unto death, and her paths unto the shades;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">None that go unto her return, neither do they attain unto the paths of life;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the whole-hearted shall remain in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the faithless shall be plucked up out of it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, forget not my teaching; but let thy heart keep my commandments;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they add to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let not kindness and truth forsake thee; bind them about thy neck, write them upon the table of thy heart;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So shalt thou find grace and good favour in the sight of God and man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Trust in the LORD with all thy heart, and lean not upon thine own understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct thy paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the LORD, and depart from evil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy vats shall overflow with new wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD, neither spurn thou His correction;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For whom the LORD loveth He correcteth, even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that obtaineth understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that holdest her fast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">By His knowledge the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">My son, let not them depart from thine eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, and thou shalt not dash thy foot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid; yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Be not afraid of sudden terror, neither of the destruction of the wicked, when it cometh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For the LORD will be thy confidence, and will keep thy foot from being caught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Withhold not good from him to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Say not unto thy neighbour: 'Go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give'; when thou hast it by thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Envy thou not the man of violence, and choose none of his ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the perverse is an abomination to the LORD; but His counsel is with the upright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked; but He blesseth the habitation of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">If it concerneth the scorners, He scorneth them, but unto the humble He giveth grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The wise shall inherit honour; but as for the fools, they carry away shame.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I give you good doctrine; forsake ye not my teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he taught me, and said unto me: 'Let thy heart hold fast my words, keep my commandments, and live;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Get wisdom, get understanding; forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee; love her, and she will keep thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The beginning of wisdom is: Get wisdom; yea, with all thy getting get understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Extol her, and she will exalt thee; she will bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace; a crown of glory will she bestow on thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of uprightness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When thou goest, thy step shall not be straitened; and if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Take fast hold of instruction, let her not go; keep her, for she is thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Enter not into the path of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Avoid it, pass not by it; turn from it, and pass on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For they sleep not, except they have done evil; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The way of the wicked is as darkness; they know not at what they stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Above all that thou guardest keep thy heart; for out of it are the issues of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Make plain the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; remove thy foot from evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, attend unto my wisdom; incline thine ear to my understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That thou mayest preserve discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on the nether-world;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Lest she should walk the even path of life, her ways wander, but she knoweth it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore, O ye children, hearken unto me, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Lest thou give thy vigour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours be in the house of an alien;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And thou moan, when thine end cometh, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And say: 'How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither have I hearkened to the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I was well nigh in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let thy springs be dispersed abroad, and courses of water in the streets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Let thy fountain be blessed; and have joy of the wife of thy youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">A lovely hind and a graceful doe, let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; with her love be thou ravished always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Why then wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of an alien?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and He maketh even all his paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">His own iniquities shall ensnare the wicked, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He shall die for lack of instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall reel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbour, if thou hast struck thy hands for a stranger--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thou art snared by the words of thy mouth, thou art caught by the words of thy mouth--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbour; go, humble thyself, and urge thy neighbour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Deliver thyself as a gazelle from the hand  of the hunter  , and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Provideth her bread in the summer, and gatherest her food in the harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">'Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep'--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So shall thy poverty come as a runner, and thy want as an armed man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A base person, a man of iniquity, is he that walketh with a froward mouth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">That winketh with his eyes, that scrapeth with his feet, that pointeth with his fingers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth evil continually; he soweth discord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; on a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There are six things which the LORD hateth, yea, seven which are an abomination unto Him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">A heart that deviseth wicked thoughts, feet that are swift in running to evil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">A false witness that breatheth out lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My son, keep the commandment of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Bind them continually upon thy heart, tie them about thy neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When thou walkest, it shall lead thee, when thou liest down, it shall watch over thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">To keep thee from the evil woman, from the smoothness of the alien tongue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; neither let her captivate thee with her eyelids.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf of bread, but the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not go unpunished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But if he be found, he must restore sevenfold, he must give all the substance of his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He that committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; he doeth it that would destroy his own soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Wounds and dishonour shall he get, and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For jealousy is the rage of a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Keep my commandments and live, and my teaching as the apple of thine eye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Say unto wisdom: 'Thou art my sister', and call understanding thy kinswoman;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the alien woman that maketh smooth her words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I beheld among the thoughtless ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Passing through the street near her corner, and he went the way to her house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">She is riotous and rebellious, her feet abide not in her house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, and lieth in wait at every corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face she said unto him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">'Sacrifices of peace-offerings were due from me; this day have I paid my vows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore came I forth to meet thee, to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I have decked my couch with coverlets, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us solace ourselves with loves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For my husband is not at home, he is gone a long journey;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He hath taken the bag of money with him; he will come home at the full moon.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield, with the blandishment of her lips she enticeth him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He goeth after her straightway, as an ox that goeth to the slaughter, or as one in fetters to the correction of the fool;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Till an arrow strike through his liver; as a bird hasteneth to the snare--and knoweth not that it is at the cost of his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now therefore, O ye children, hearken unto me, and attend to the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let not thy heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For she hath cast down many wounded; yea, a mighty host are all her slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Her house is the way to the nether-world, going down to the chambers of death.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Doth not wisdom call, and understanding put forth her voice?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet, she standeth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">'Unto you, O men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">O ye thoughtless, understand prudence, and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Hear, for I will speak excellent things, and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For my mouth shall utter truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All the words of my mouth are in righteousness, there is nothing perverse or crooked in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Receive my instruction, and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For wisdom is better than rubies, and all things desirable are not to be compared unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of devices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">All things toil to weariness; man cannot utter it, the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That which hath been is that which shall be, and that which hath been done is that which shall be done; and there is nothing new under the sun.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">I Koheleth have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven; it is a sore task that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I spoke with my own heart, saying: 'Lo, I have gotten great wisdom, more also than all that were before me over Jerusalem'; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly--I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For in much wisdom is much vexation; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I said in my heart: 'Come now, I will try thee with mirth, and enjoy pleasure'; and, behold, this also was vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I said of laughter: 'It is mad'; and of mirth: 'What doth it accomplish?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I searched in my heart how to pamper my flesh with wine, and, my heart conducting itself with wisdom, how yet to lay hold on folly, till I might see which it was best for the sons of men that they should do under the heaven the few days of their life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the wood springing up with trees;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I acquired men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I gathered me also silver and gold, and treasure such as kings and the provinces have as their own; I got me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, women very many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom stood me in stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy, for my heart had joy of all my labour; and this was my portion from all my labour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness and folly; for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The wise man, his eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness. And I also perceived that one event happeneth to them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then said I in my heart: 'As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?' Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will long ago have been forgotten. And how must the wise man die even as the fool!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I hated all my labour wherein I laboured under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labour wherein I had laboured under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For there is a man whose labour is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skill; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For what hath a man of all his labour, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboureth under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For all his days are pains, and his occupation vexation; yea, even in the night his heart taketh not rest. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy pleasure for his labour. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For who will eat, or who will enjoy, if not I?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For to the man that is good in His sight He giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner He giveth the task, to gather and to heap up, that he may leave to him that is good in the sight of God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all return to dust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying: 'Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say: Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I remember him, saith the LORD; though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jeremiah said: 'The word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Behold, Hanamel, the son of Shallum thine uncle, shall come unto thee, saying: Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Hanamel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me: 'Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself.' Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle's son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle  's son  , and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I charged Baruch before them, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">'Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase, both that which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon; and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah: 'Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee: Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not reported.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls; and he went out the way of the Arabah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he gave judgment upon him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, that were carried away captive unto Babylon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasa king of Israel; the same Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled with them that were slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, that dwelt at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">'Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherefore My fury and Mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">in that ye provoke Me with the works of your hands, offering unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to sojourn; that ye may be cut off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Have ye forgotten the wicked deeds of your fathers, and the wicked deeds of the kings of Judah, and the wicked deeds of their wives, and your own wicked deeds, and the wicked deeds of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Then all the men who knew that their wives offered unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to offer unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But since we let off to offer to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And is it we that offer to the queen of heaven, and pour out drink-offerings unto her? did we make her cakes in her image, and pour out drink-offerings unto her, without our husbands?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people that had given him that answer, saying:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Because ye have offered, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not hearkened to the voice of the LORD, nor walked in His law, nor in His statutes, nor in His testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire flashing up, so that a brightness was round about it; and out of the midst thereof as the colour of electrum, out of the midst of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and as for the faces and wings of them four,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus were their faces; and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they went every one straight forward; whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like coals of fire, burning like the appearance of torches; it flashed up and down among the living creatures; and there was brightness to the fire, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel at the bottom hard by the living creatures, at the four faces thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl; and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they went, they went toward their four sides; they turned not when they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As for their rings, they were high and they were dreadful; and they four had their rings full of eyes round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the living creatures went, the wheels went hard by them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the bottom, the wheels were lifted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Whithersoever the spirit was to go, as the spirit was to go thither, so they went; and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When those went, these went, and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of a firmament, like the colour of the terrible ice, stretched forth over their heads above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And under the firmament were their wings conformable the one to the other; this one of them had two which covered, and that one of them had two which covered, their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host; when they stood, they let down their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For, when there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads, as they stood, they let down their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And I saw as the colour of electrum, as the appearance of fire round about enclosing it, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And He said unto me: 'Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with My words unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For thou art not sent to a people of an unintelligible speech and of a slow tongue, but to the house of Israel;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead; fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">'Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and say: Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem: Thine origin and thy nativity is of the land of the Canaanite; the Amorite was thy father, and thy mother was a Hittite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water for cleansing; thou was not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">No eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field in the loathsomeness of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when I passed by thee, and saw thee wallowing in thy blood, I said unto thee: In thy blood, live; yea, I said unto thee: In thy blood, live;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I cause thee to increase, even as the growth of the field. And thou didst increase and grow up, and thou camest to excellent beauty: thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair was grown; yet thou wast naked and bare.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, and, behold, thy time was the time of love, I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness; yea, I swore unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest Mine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then washed I thee with water; yea, I cleansed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I clothed thee also with richly woven work, and shod thee with sealskin, and I wound fine linen about thy head, and covered thee with silk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I put a ring upon thy nose, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and richly woven work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou didst wax exceeding beautiful, and thou wast meet for royal estate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect, through My splendour which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But thou didst trust in thy beauty and play the harlot because of thy renown, and didst pour out thy harlotries on every one that passed by; his it was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And thou didst take of thy garments, and didst make for thee high places decked with divers colours, and didst play the harlot upon them; the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Thou didst also take thy fair jewels of My gold and of My silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of men, and didst play the harlot with them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and thou didst take thy richly woven garments and cover them, and didst set Mine oil and Mine incense before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savour, and thus it was; saith the Lord GOD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto Me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Were thy harlotries a small matter,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">that thou hast slain My children, and delivered them up, in setting them apart unto them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And in all thine abominations and thy harlotries thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast wallowing in thy blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass after all thy wickedness--woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord GOD--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">that thou hast built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee a lofty place in every street.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thou hast built thy lofty place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty an abomination, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy harlotries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Thou hast also played the harlot with the Egyptians, thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy harlotry, to provoke Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Behold, therefore I have stretched out My hand over thee, and have diminished thine allowance, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, that are ashamed of thy lewd way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, without having enough; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet thou wast not satisfied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Thou hast moreover multiplied thy harlotry with the land of traffic, even with Chaldea; and yet thou didst not have enough herewith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of a wanton harlot;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thy lofty place in every street; and hast not been as a harlot that enhanceth her hire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Thou wife that committest adultery, that takest strangers instead of thy husband--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">to all harlots gifts are given; but thou hast given thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hast bribed them to come unto thee from every side in thy harlotries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the contrary is in thee from other women, in that thou didst solicit to harlotry, and wast not solicited; and in that thou givest hire, and no hire is given unto thee, thus thou art contrary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Thus saith the Lord GOD: Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness uncovered through thy harlotries with thy lovers; and because of all the idols of thy abominations, and for the blood of thy children, that thou didst give unto them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">therefore behold, I will gather all thy lovers, unto whom thou hast been pleasant, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them against thee from every side, and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of fury and jealousy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and break down thy lofty places; and they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take thy fair jewels; and they shall leave thee naked and bare.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They shall also bring up an assembly against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt also give no hire any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So will I satisfy My fury upon thee, and My jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted Me in all these things; lo, therefore I also will bring thy way upon thy head, saith the Lord GOD; or hast thou not committed this lewdness above all thine abominations?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying: As the mother, so her daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Thou art thy mother's daughter, that loatheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children; your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And thine elder sister is Samaria, that dwelleth at thy left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Yet hast thou not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but in a very little while thou didst deal more corruptly than they in all thy ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fulness of bread, and careless ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And they were haughty, and committed abomination before Me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Neither hath Samaria committed even half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Thou also, bear thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters; through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than thou; yea, be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And I will turn their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">before thy wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the taunt of the daughters of Aram, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that have thee in disdain round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">For thus saith the Lord GOD: I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Nevertheless I will remember My covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder sisters and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not because of thy covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And I will establish My covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame; when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">'Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and say: Thus saith the Lord GOD: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof, and carried it into a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters, he set it as a slip.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose tendrils might turn toward him, and the roots thereof be under him; so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers; and, behold, this vine did bend its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a stately vine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Say thou: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither, yea, wither in all its sprouting leaves? neither shall great power or much people be at hand when it is plucked up by the roots thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? Shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? In the beds where it grew it shall wither.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">'Say now to the rebellious house: Know ye not what these things mean? tell them: Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and brought them to him to Babylon;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him, and brought him under an oath, and the mighty of the land he took away;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">that his might be a lowly kingdom, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company succour him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many souls;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">seeing he hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: As I live, surely Mine oath that he hath despised, and My covenant that he hath broken, I will even bring it upon his own head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I will spread My net upon him, and he shall be taken in My snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his treachery that he hath committed against Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And all his mighty men in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind; and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Thus saith the Lord GOD: Moreover I will take, even I, of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it upon a high mountain and eminent;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a stately cedar; and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing, in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish; I the LORD have spoken and have done it.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">'What mean ye, that ye use this proverb in the land of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold, all souls are Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine; the soul that sinneth, it shall die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a woman in her impurity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and hath not wronged any, but hath restored his pledge for a debt, hath taken nought by robbery, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">he that hath not given forth upon interest, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true justice between man and man,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth to a brother any of these things,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">whereas he himself had not done any of these things, for he hath even eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">hath wronged the poor and needy, hath taken by robbery, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase; shall he then live? he shall not live--he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely be put to death, his blood shall be upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins, which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">that hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">neither hath wronged any, hath not taken aught to pledge, neither hath taken by robbery, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">that hath withdrawn his hand from the poor, that hath not received interest nor increase, hath executed Mine ordinances, hath walked in My statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, committed robbery on his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he dieth for his iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet say ye: Why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father with him? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all My statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The soul that sinneth, it shall die; the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father with him, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son with him; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all My statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">None of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him; for his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">in that day I lifted up My hand unto them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had sought out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the beauty of all lands;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">But I wrought for My name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among whom they were, in whose sight I made Myself known unto them, so as to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">IN THE third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god, and the vessels he brought into the treasure-house of his god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz his chief officer, that he should bring in certain of the children of Israel, and of the seed royal, and of the nobles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">youths in whom was no blemish, but fair to look on, and skilful in all wisdom, and skilful in knowledge, and discerning in thought, and such as had ability to stand in the king's palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the chief of the officers gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the chief of the officers that he might not defile himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And God granted Daniel mercy and compassion in the sight of the chief of the officers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the chief of the officers said unto Daniel: 'I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces sad in comparison with the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with the king.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said Daniel to the steward, whom the chief of the officers had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">'Try thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And the king spoke with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore stood they before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Aramaic: 'O king, live for ever! tell thy servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans: 'The thing is certain with me; if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if ye declare the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour; only declare unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They answered the second time and said: 'Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The king answered and said: 'I know of a truth that ye would gain time, inasmuch as ye see the thing is certain with me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">that, if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; and ye have agreed together to speak before me lying and corrupt words, till the time be changed; only tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can declare unto me the interpretation thereof.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said: 'There is not a man upon the earth that can declare the king's matter; forasmuch as no great and powerful king hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and discretion to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">he answered and said to Arioch the king's captain: 'Wherefore is the decree so peremptory from the king?' Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, that he might declare unto the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that they might ask mercy of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Daniel spoke and said: Blessed be the name of God from everlasting even unto everlasting; for wisdom and might are His;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And He changeth the times and the seasons; He removeth kings, and setteth up kings; He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He revealeth the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I thank Thee, and praise Thee, O Thou God of my fathers, who hath given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of Thee; for Thou hast made known unto us the king's matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: 'Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will declare unto the king the interpretation.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him: 'I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king spoke and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar: 'Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Daniel answered before the king, and said: 'The secret which the king hath asked can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor astrologers, declare unto the king;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and He hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them; and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Thou, O king, king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed; then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Daniel spoke and said: I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven broke forth upon the great sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings; I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon two feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was said thus unto it: 'Arise, devour much flesh.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the sides of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was as white snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke, I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the Ancient of days, and he was brought near before Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As for me Daniel, my spirit was pained in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head affrighted me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">'These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell; even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose appearance was greater than that of its fellows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High; and the time came, and the saints possessed the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Thus he said: 'The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise; and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the judgment shall sit, and his dominions shall be taken away, to be consumed and to be destroy unto the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Here is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much affrighted me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the castle, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the stream Ulai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the stream a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the stream, and ran at him in the fury of his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly; and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up the appearance of four horns toward the four winds of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauteous land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and from him the continual burnt-offering was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt-offering through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it wrought, and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spoke: 'How long shall be the vision concerning the continual burnt-offering, and the transgression that causes appalment, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled under foot?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said unto me: 'Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be victorious.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of Ulai, who called, and said: 'Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was terrified, and fell upon my face; but he said unto me: 'Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said: 'Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The ram which thou sawest having the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have completed their transgression, there shall stand up a king of fierce countenance, and understanding stratagems.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do; and he shall destroy them that are mighty and the people of the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And through his cunning he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in time of security shall he destroy many; he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true; but thou, shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was appalled at the vision, but understood it not.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in the first year of his reign I Daniel meditated in the books, over the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish for the desolations of Jerusalem seventy years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made confession, and said: 'O Lord, the great and awful God, who keepest covenant and mercy with them that love Thee and keep Thy commandments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">we have sinned, and have dealt iniquitously, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, and have turned aside from Thy commandments and from Thine ordinances;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">neither have we hearkened unto Thy servants the prophets, that spoke in Thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">O LORD, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against Thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">To the Lord our God belong compassions and forgivenesses; for we have rebelled against Him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">neither have we hearkened to the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in His laws, which He set before us by His servants the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yea, all Israel have transgressed Thy law, and have turned aside, so as not to hearken to Thy voice; and so there hath been poured out upon us the curse and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And He hath confirmed His word, which He spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; so that under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us; yet have we not entreated the favour of the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in Thy truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And so the LORD hath watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for the LORD our God is righteous in all His works which He hath done, and we have not hearkened to His voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought Thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten Thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">O Lord, according to all Thy righteousness, let Thine anger and Thy fury, I pray Thee, be turned away from Thy city Jerusalem, Thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now therefore, O our God, hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause Thy face to shine upon Thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">O my God, incline Thine ear, and hear; open Thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city upon which Thy name is called; for we do not present our supplications before Thee because of our righteousness, but because of Thy great compassions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">O Lord, hear, O Lord, forgive, O Lord, attend and do, defer not; for Thine own sake, O my God, because Thy name is called upon Thy city and Thy people.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And he made me to understand, and talked with me, and said: 'O Daniel, I am now come forth to make thee skilful of understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">At the beginning of thy supplications a word went forth, and I am come to declare it; for thou art greatly beloved; therefore look into the word, and understand the vision.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the word was true, even a great warfare; and he gave heed to the word, and had understanding of the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In those days I Daniel was mourning three whole weeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Tigris,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I Daniel alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; howbeit a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So that I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me tottering upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said unto me: 'O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, give heed unto the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for now am I sent unto thee'; and when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said he unto me: 'Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard; and I am come because of thy words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I was left over there beside the kings of Persia.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">IN THE second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">'Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying: This people say: The time is not come, the time that the LORD'S house should be built.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">'Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your cieled houses, while this house lieth waste?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Ye have sown much, and brought in little, ye eat, but ye have not enough, ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink, ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages for a bag with holes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Go up to the hill-country, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of My house that lieth waste, while ye run every man for his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore over you the heaven hath kept back, so that there is no dew, and the earth hath kept back her produce.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, hearkened unto the voice of the LORD their God, and unto the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him; and the people did fear before the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then spoke Haggai the LORD'S messenger in the LORD'S message unto the people, saying: 'I am with you, saith the LORD.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">in the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">'Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? and how do ye see it now? is not such a one as nothing in your eyes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work; for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt have I established, and My spirit abideth among you; fear ye not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For thus saith the LORD of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and I will shake all nations, and the choicest things of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, saith the LORD of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, saith the LORD of hosts; and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">'Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Ask now the priests for instruction, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If one bear hallowed flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it be holy?' And the priests answered and said: 'No.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then said Haggai: 'If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean?' And the priests answered and said: 'It shall be unclean.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then answered Haggai, and said: 'So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And now, I pray you, consider from this day and forward--before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw out fifty press-measures, there were but twenty;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands; yet ye turned not to Me, saith the LORD--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">consider, I pray you, from this day and forward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD'S temple was laid, consider it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">is the seed yet in the barn? yea, the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree hath not brought forth--from this day will I bless you.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the word of the LORD came the second time unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">'Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying: I will shake the heavens and the earth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.'</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">IN THE eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Return unto Me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying: Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings; but they did not hear, nor attend unto Me, saith the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? so that they turned and said: Like as the LORD of hosts purposed to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath He dealt with us.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I saw in the night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said I: 'O my lord, what are these?' And the angel that spoke with me said unto me: 'I will show thee what these are.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said: 'These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said: 'We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the angel of the LORD spoke and said: 'O LORD of hosts, how long wilt Thou not have compassion on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which Thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the LORD answered the angel that spoke with me with good words, even comforting words--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">so the angel that spoke with me said unto me: 'Proclaim thou, saying: Thus saith the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped for evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore thus saith the LORD: I return to Jerusalem with compassions: My house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Again, proclaim, saying: Thus saith the LORD of hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And the LORD showed me four craftsmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then said I: 'What come these to do?' And he spoke, saying: 'These--the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head--these then are come to frighten them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.'</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then said I: 'Whither goest thou?' And he said unto me: 'To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And, behold, the angel that spoke with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and said unto him: 'Run, speak to this young man, saying: 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Ho, ho, flee then from the land of the north, saith the LORD; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Ho, Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For thus saith the LORD of hosts who sent me after glory unto the nations which spoiled you: 'Surely, he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the LORD said unto Satan: 'The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan, yea, the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee; is not this man a brand plucked out of the fire?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he answered and spoke unto those that stood before him, saying: 'Take the filthy garments from off him.' And unto him he said: 'Behold, I cause thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with robes.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I said: 'Let them set a fair mitre upon his head.' So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of the LORD stood by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the angel of the LORD forewarned Joshua, saying:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said unto me: 'What seest thou?' And I said: 'I have seen, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes, yea, seven, to the lamps, which are upon the top thereof;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a flying roll.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said he unto me: 'This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole land; for every one that stealeth shall be swept away on the one side like it; and every one that sweareth shall be swept away on the other side like it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the measure between the earth and the heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said I to the angel that spoke with me: 'Whither do these bear the measure?'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled bay horses.</VERS>
