    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">IN THE beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God said: 'Let there be light.' And there was light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And God said: 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And God said: 'Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.' And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters called He Seas; and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God said: 'Let the earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit-tree bearing fruit after its kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth.' And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed after its kind, and tree bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after its kind; and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And God said: 'Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.' And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And God said: 'Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let fowl fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after its kind, and every winged fowl after its kind; and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And God blessed them, saying: 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And God said: 'Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind.' And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And God said: 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And God blessed them; and God said unto them: 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And God said: 'Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed--to you it shall be for food;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is a living soul,  I have given  every green herb for food.' And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it He rested from all His work which God in creating had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">No shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the LORD God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the name of the third river is Tigris;    that is it which goeth toward the east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the LORD God commanded the man, saying: 'Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the LORD God said: 'It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man would call every living creature, that was to be the name thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the place with flesh instead thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from the man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the man said: 'This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman,    because she was taken out of Man.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman: 'Yea, hath God said: Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the woman said unto the serpent: 'Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the serpent said unto the woman: 'Ye shall not surely die;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves girdles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden toward the cool of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the LORD God called unto the man, and said unto him: 'Where art thou?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said: 'I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And He said: 'Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the man said: 'The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the LORD God said unto the woman: 'What is this thou hast done?' And the woman said: 'The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the LORD God said unto the serpent: 'Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou from among all cattle, and from among all beasts of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; they shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise their heel.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Unto the woman He said: 'I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And unto Adam He said: 'Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying: Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the man called his wife's name Eve;    because she was the mother of all living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the LORD God said: 'Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way to the tree of life.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived and bore Cain, and said: 'I have gotten    a man with the help of the LORD.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And again she bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the LORD said unto Cain: 'Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee is its desire, but thou mayest rule over it.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Cain spoke unto Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the LORD said unto Cain: 'Where is Abel thy brother?' And he said: 'I know not; am I my brother's keeper?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And He said: 'What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Cain said unto the LORD: 'My punishment is greater than I can bear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land; and from Thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the LORD said unto him: 'Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.' And the LORD set a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod,    on the east of Eden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch; and he builded a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael; and Mehujael    begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lamech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Lamech took unto him two wives; the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech; for I have slain a man for wounding me, and a young man for bruising me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name Seth:    'for God hath    appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh; then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made He him;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">then ye shall let your children know, saying: Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up from before us, until we were passed over,</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, that were by the sea, heard how that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until they were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">At that time the LORD said unto Joshua: 'Make thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Joshua made him knives of flint, and circumcised the children of Israel at Gibeath-ha-araloth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, had not been circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD; unto whom the LORD swore that He would not let them see the land which the LORD swore unto their fathers that He would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And He raised up their children in their stead; them did Joshua circumcise; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised by the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, when all the nation were circumcised, every one of them, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the LORD said unto Joshua: 'This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.' Wherefore the name of that place was called Gilgal,    unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn, in the selfsame day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him: 'Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said: 'Nay, but I am captain of the host of the LORD; I am now come.' And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed down, and said unto him: 'What saith my lord unto his servant?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the captain of the LORD'S host said unto Joshua: 'Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy.' And Joshua did so.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.--</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And seven priests shall bear seven rams' horns before the ark; and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it shall be, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the horn, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them: 'Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said unto the people: 'Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed body pass on before the ark of the LORD.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it was so, that when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven rams' horns before the LORD passed on, and blew with the horns; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the armed men went before the priests that blew the horns, and the rearward went after the ark,  the priests  blowing with the horns continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Joshua commanded the people, saying: 'Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So he caused the ark of the LORD to compass the city, going about it once; and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the seven priests bearing the seven rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the horns; and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of the LORD,  the priests   blowing with the horns continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp; so they did six days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times; only on that day they compassed the city seven times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the horns, that Joshua said unto the people: 'Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to the LORD; only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">So the people shouted, and  the priests  blew with the horns. And it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the horn, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land: 'Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye swore unto her.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had, all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Rahab the harlot, and her father's household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel, unto this day; because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Joshua charged the people with an oath at that time, saying: 'Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city, even Jericho; with the loss of his first-born shall he lay the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.'</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But the children of Israel committed a trespass concerning the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing; and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spoke unto them, saying: 'Go up and spy out the land.' And the men went up and spied out Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him: 'Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for they are but few.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men; and they fled before the men of Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Joshua said: 'Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast Thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For when the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land hear of it, they will compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt Thou do for Thy great name?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the LORD said unto Joshua: 'Get thee up; wherefore, now, art thou fallen upon thy face?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed My covenant which I commanded them; yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing; and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have even put it among their own stuff.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies, they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed; I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Up, sanctify the people, and say: Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow; for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: There is a curse in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the morning therefore ye shall draw near by your tribes; and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come near by families; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come near by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come near man by man.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">When I saw among the spoil a goodly Shinar    mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel; and they laid them down before the LORD.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">And Joshua said: 'Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day.' And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they raised over him a great heap of stones, unto this day; and the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called The valley of Achor,    unto this day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valour, and sent them forth by night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he commanded them, saying: 'Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city; and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say: They flee before us, as at the first; so we will flee before them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of the LORD shall ye do; see, I have commanded you.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua lodged that night among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And all the people, even the men of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai--now there was a valley between him and Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So the people set themselves in array, even all the host that was on the north of the city, their rear lying in wait on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the vale.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hastened and rose up early and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, in front of the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hastened and set the city on fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned back, and slew the men of Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the other came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, even in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">'Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying: 'Slack not thy hands from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the LORD said unto Joshua: 'Fear them not; for I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand against thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; for he went up from Gilgal all the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon; and they chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died; they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel: 'Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man; for the LORD fought for Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities; for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace; none whetted his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then said Joshua: 'Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him: 'Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings.'

      <VERS vnumber="25">And Joshua said unto them: 'Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage; for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees; and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Gideon saw that he was the angel of the LORD; and Gideon said: 'Alas, O Lord GOD! forasmuch as I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the LORD said unto him: 'Peace be unto thee; fear not; thou shalt not die.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it 'Adonai-shalom';    unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him: 'Take thy father's bullock, and the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had spoken unto him; and it came to pass, because he feared his father's household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the men of the city said unto Joash: 'Bring out thy son, that he may die; because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And Joash said unto all that stood against him: 'Will ye contend for Baal? or will ye save him? he that will contend for him, shall be put to death before morning; if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one hath broken down his altar.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Therefore on that day he was called Jerubbaal,    saying: 'Let Baal contend against him, because he hath broken down his altar.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">And Gideon said unto God: 'Let not Thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, I pray Thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.'</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside En-harod; and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by Gibeath-moreh, in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the LORD said unto Gideon: 'The people that are with thee are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against Me, saying: mine own hand hath saved me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now therefore make proclamation in the ears of the people, saying: Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead.' And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the LORD said unto Gideon: 'The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there; and it shall be, that of whom I say to thee: This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee: This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he brought down the people unto the water; and the LORD said unto Gideon: 'Everyone that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the LORD said unto Gideon: 'By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the people go every man unto his place.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So they took the victuals of the people in their hand, and their horns; and he sent all the men of Israel every man unto his tent, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him: 'Arise, get thee down upon the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down upon the camp.' Then went he down with Purah his servant unto the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man telling a dream unto his follow, and saying: 'Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and smote it that it fell, and turned it upside down, that the tent lay flat.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And his fellow answered and said: 'This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand God hath delivered Midian, and all the host.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said: 'Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them horns, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said unto them: 'Look on me, and do likewise; and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When I blow the horn, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the horns also on every side of all the camp, and say: For the LORD and for Gideon!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch; and they blew the horns, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the three companies blew the horns, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the horns in their right hands wherewith to blow; and they cried: 'The sword for the LORD and for Gideon!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they blew the three hundred horns, and the LORD set every man's sword a against his fellow, even throughout all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying: 'Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.' So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb at the Rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the Winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the men of Ephraim said unto him: 'Why hast thou served us thus, that thou didst not call us when thou wentest to fight with Midian?' And they did chide with him sharply.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">God hath delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?' Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said unto the men of Succoth: 'Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the host of the children of the east; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him; and he wrote down for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said: 'Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying: Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he broke down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna: 'Where are the men whom ye slew at Tabor?' And they answered: 'As thou art, so were they; of one form with the children of a king.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Zebah and Zalmunna said: 'Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength.' And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels' necks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon: 'Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also; for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Midian.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And Gideon said unto them: 'I would make a request of you, that ye would give me every man the ear-rings of his spoil.'--For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they answered: 'We will willingly give them.' And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were amazed; for they saw that evil was come upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and they that came out of the city destroyed them in the midst of the men of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">They inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and overtook them at their resting-place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon; and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and followed hard after them unto Gidom, and smote of them two thousand men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem in Judah. And they came into the field of Moab, and continued there.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Then she fell on her face, and bowed down to the ground, and said unto him: 'Why have I found favour in thy sight, that thou shouldest take cognizance of me, seeing I am a foreigner?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Boaz answered and said unto her: 'It hath fully been told me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The LORD recompense thy work, and be thy reward complete from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then she said: 'Let me find favour in thy sight, my LORD; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Boaz said unto her at meal-time: 'Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.' And she sat beside the reapers; and they reached her parched corn, and she did eat and was satisfied, and left thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying: 'Let her glean even among the sheaves, and put her not to shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And also pull out some for her of purpose from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was satisfied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And her mother-in-law said unto her: 'Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.' And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said: 'The man's name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law: 'Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off His kindness to the living and to the dead.' And Naomi said unto her: 'The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there; and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom he said: 'Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.' And he turned aside, and sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said: 'Sit ye down here.' And they sat down.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said: 'We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; and do thou worthily in Ephrath, and be famous in Beth-lehem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">NOW THERE was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there priests unto the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass upon a day, when Elkanah sacrificed, that he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but the LORD had shut up her womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And her rival vexed her sore, to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she vexed her; therefore she wept, and would not eat.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">and she was in bitterness of soul--and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And she vowed a vow, and said: 'O LORD of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thy handmaid, but wilt give unto Thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman: for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation have I spoken hitherto.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he had a son, whose name was Saul, young and goodly, and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son: 'Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found them not; then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not; and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him: 'Come and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and become anxious concerning us.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said unto him: 'Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man that is held in honour; all that he saith cometh surely to pass; now let us go thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then said Saul to his servant: 'But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God; what have we?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the servant answered Saul again, and said: 'Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver, that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.'--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said: 'Come and let us go to the seer'; for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer.--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said Saul to his servant: 'Well said; come, let us go.' So they went unto the city where the man of God was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them: 'Is the seer here?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they answered them, and said: 'He is; behold, he is before thee; make haste now, for he is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As soon as ye are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get you up; for at this time ye shall find him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they went up to the city; and as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now the LORD had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">'To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over My people Israel, and he shall save My people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon My people, because their cry is come unto Me.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD spoke unto him: 'Behold the man of whom I said unto thee: This same shall have authority over My people.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Samuel answered Saul, and said: 'I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day; and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Saul answered and said: 'Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, who were about thirty persons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Samuel said unto the cook: 'Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee: Set it by thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And  Samuel  said: 'Behold that which hath been reserved! set it before thee and eat; because unto the appointed time hath it been kept for thee, for I said: I have invited the people.' So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he spoke with Saul upon the housetop.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they arose early; and it came to pass about the break of day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying: 'Up, that I may send thee away.' And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul: 'Bid the servant pass on before us--and he passed on--but stand thou still at this time, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said: 'Is it not that the LORD hath anointed thee to be prince over His inheritance?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the terebinth of Tabor, and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they will salute thee, and give thee two cakes of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines; and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And one of the same place answered and said: 'And who is their father?' Therefore it became a proverb: 'Is Saul also among the prophets?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant: 'Whither went ye?' And he said: 'To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeath-benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went hither and thither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then said Saul unto the people that were with him: 'Number now, and see who is gone from us.' And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Saul said unto Ahijah: 'Bring hither the ark of God.' For the ark of God was there at that time with the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said unto the priest: 'Withdraw thy hand.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle; and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as beforetime, and that went up with them into the camp round about; even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Likewise all the men of Israel that had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So the LORD saved Israel that day; and the battle passed on as far as Beth-aven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the men of Israel were distressed that day; but Saul adjured the people, saying: 'Cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies.' So none of the people tasted food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the people were come unto the forest, behold a flow of honey; but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath; and he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then answered one of the people, and said: 'Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying: Cursed be the man that eateth food this day; and the people are faint.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then said Jonathan: 'My father hath troubled the land; see, I pray you, how mine eyes are brightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? had there not been then a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmas to Aijalon; and the people were very faint.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then they told Saul, saying: 'Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood.' And he said: 'Ye have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone unto me this day.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Saul said: 'Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them: Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood.' And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Saul built an altar unto the LORD; the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Saul said: 'Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.' And they said: 'Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee.' Then said the priest: 'Let us draw near hither unto God.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Saul asked counsel of God: 'Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt Thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?' But He answered him not that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Saul said: 'Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of the people; and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For, as the LORD liveth, who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.' But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then said he unto all Israel: 'Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.' And the people said unto Saul: 'Do what seemeth good unto thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Therefore Saul said unto the LORD, the God of Israel: 'Declare the right.' And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot; but the people escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Saul said: 'Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.' And Jonathan was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then Saul said to Jonathan: 'Tell me what thou hast done.' And Jonathan told him, and said: 'I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; here am I: I will die.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And Saul said: 'God do so and more also; thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And the people said unto Saul: 'Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it; as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day.' So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; and whithersoever he turned himself, he put them to the worse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchi-shua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz; and the name of the captain of his host was Abner,    the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Samuel said unto Saul: 'The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over His people, over Israel; now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Saul said unto the Kenites: 'Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.' So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is in front of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, even the young of the second birth, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them; but every thing that was of no account and feeble, that they destroyed utterly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">'It repenteth Me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following Me, and hath not performed My commandments.' And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying: 'Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he is setting him up a monument, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him: 'Blessed be thou of the LORD; I have performed the commandment of the LORD.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And Saul said unto Samuel: 'Yea, I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Samuel said: 'Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in hearkening to the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, He hath also rejected thee from being king.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Saul said unto Samuel: 'I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words; because I feared the people, and hearkened to their voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Samuel said unto Saul: 'I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Samuel said unto him: 'The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said: 'Comest thou peaceably?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said: 'Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.' And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, when they were come, that he beheld Eliab, and said: 'Surely the LORD'S anointed is before Him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the LORD said unto Samuel: 'Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him; for it is not as man seeth: for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren; and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD terrified him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Saul's servants said unto him: 'Behold now, an evil spirit from God terrifieth thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said Jonathan unto David: 'What doth thy soul desire, that I should do it for thee?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David said unto Jonathan: 'Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, when I should sit with the king to eat; so let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If thy father miss me at all, then say: David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If he say thus: It is well; thy servant shall have peace; but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee; but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jonathan said: 'Far be it from thee; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said David to Jonathan: 'Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jonathan said unto David: 'Come and let us go out into the field.' And they went out both of them into the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jonathan said unto David: 'The LORD, the God of Israel--when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow, or the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The LORD do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace; and the LORD be with thee, as He hath been with my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David: 'The LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jonathan said unto him: 'To-morrow is the new moon; and thou wilt be missed, thy seat will be empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And in the third day thou shalt hide thyself well, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself in the day of work, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I will shoot three arrows to the side-ward, as though I shot at a mark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And, behold, I will send the lad: Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad: Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as the LORD liveth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And as touching the matter which I and thou have spoken of, behold, the LORD is between me and thee for ever.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to the meal to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side; but David's place was empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day; for he thought: 'Something hath befallen him, he is unclean; surely he is not clean.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was the second day, that David's place was empty; and Saul said unto Jonathan his son: 'Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to the meal, neither yesterday, nor to-day?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Jonathan answered Saul: 'David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and he said: Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me; and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king's table.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him: 'Thou son of perverse rebellion, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother's nakedness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he deserveth to die.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him: 'Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put David to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, and because his father had put him to shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he said unto his lad: 'Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.' And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said: 'Is not the arrow beyond thee?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Jonathan cried after the lad: 'Make speed, hasten, stay not.' And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But the lad knew not any thing; only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him: 'Go, carry them to the city.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed down three times; and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Jonathan said to David: 'Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying: The LORD shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, for ever.'  And he arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said unto him: 'Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David said unto Ahimelech the priest: 'The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me: Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee; and the young men have I appointed to such and such a place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now therefore what is under thy hand? five loaves of bread? give them in my hand, or whatsoever there is present.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And David answered the priest, and said unto him: 'Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then to-day, when there shall be holy bread in their vessels?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.--</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David knew that Saul devised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest: 'Bring hither the ephod.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said David: 'O LORD, the God of Israel, Thy servant hath surely heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as Thy servant hath heard?' O LORD, the God of Israel, I beseech Thee, tell Thy servant.' And the LORD said: 'He will come down.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then said David: 'Will the men of Keilah deliver up me and my men into the hand of Saul?' And the LORD said: 'They will deliver thee up.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbore to go forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life; and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said unto him: 'Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they two made a covenant before the LORD; and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying: 'Doth not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king's hand.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Saul said: 'Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have had compassion on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Go, I pray you, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there; for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hideth himself, and come ye back to me with the certainty, and I will go with you; and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul; but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of Jeshimon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David; wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying: 'Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines; therefore they called that place Sela- hammahlekoth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And David went up from thence, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying: 'Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the men of David said unto him: 'Behold the day in which the LORD hath said unto thee: Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto thee.' Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said unto his men: 'The LORD forbid it me, that I should do this thing unto my lord, the LORD'S anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is the LORD'S anointed.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying: 'My lord the king.' And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and prostrated himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David said to Saul: 'Wherefore hearkenest thou to men's words, saying: Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to-day into my hand in the cave; and some bade me kill thee; but mine eye spared thee; and I said: I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is the LORD'S anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though thou layest wait for my soul to take it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee; but my hand shall not be upon thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">The LORD therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said: 'Is this thy voice, my son David?' And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said to David: 'Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee evil.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And David swore unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men got them up unto the stronghold.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful form; but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David sent ten young men, and David said unto the young men: 'Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and thus ye shall say: All hail! and peace be both unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And now I have heard that thou hast shearers; thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee; wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes; for we come on a good day; give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thy hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Nabal answered David's servants, and said: 'Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a- days that break away every man from his master;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men of whom I know not whence they are?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So David's young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And David said unto his men: 'Gird ye on every man his sword.' And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword; and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying: 'Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he flew upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house; for he is such a base fellow, that one cannot speak to him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And she said unto her young men: 'Go on before me; behold, I come after you.' But she told not her husband Nabal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down towards her; and she met them.--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now David had said: 'Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him; and he hath returned me evil for good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">God do so unto the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light so much as one male.'--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when Abigail saw David, she made haste, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed down to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And she fell at his feet, and said: 'Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity; and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this base fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he: Nabal    is his name, and churlishness is with him; but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from finding redress for thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid; for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD; and evil is not found in thee all thy days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And though man be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that He hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee prince over Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">that this shall be no stumbling-block unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath found redress for himself. And when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And David said to Abigail:    'Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed be thou, that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from finding redress for myself with mine own hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For in very deed, as the LORD, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou hadst made haste and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one male.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So David received of her hand that which she had brought him; and he said unto her: 'Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken; wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, so that he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said: 'Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back His servant from evil; and the evil-doing of Nabal hath the LORD returned upon his own head.' And David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke unto her, saying: 'David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And she arose, and bowed down with her face to the earth, and said: 'Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Abigail hastened, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying: 'Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host; and Saul lay within the barricade, and the people pitched round about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying: 'Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?' And Abishai said: 'I will go down with thee.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So David and Abishai came to the people by night; and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the barricade, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then said Abishai to David: 'God hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day; now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David said to Abishai: 'Destroy him not; for who can put forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed, and be guiltless?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And David said: 'As the LORD liveth, nay, but the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle, and be swept away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The LORD forbid it me, that I should put forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed; but now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water and let us go.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's head; and they got them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying: 'Answerest thou not, Abner?' Then Abner answered and said: 'Who art thou that criest to the king?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And David said to Abner: 'Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye deserve to die, because ye have not kept watch over your lord, the LORD'S anointed. And now, see, where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Saul knew David's voice, and said: 'Is this thy voice, my son David?' And David said: 'It is my voice, my lord, O king.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said: 'Wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be the LORD that hath stirred thee up against me, let Him accept an offering; but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of the LORD, saying: Go, serve other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the LORD; for the king of Israel is come out to seek a single flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then said Saul: 'I have sinned; return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine eyes this day; behold, I have played the fool and erred exceedingly.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And David answered and said: 'Behold the king's spear! let then one of the young men come over and fetch it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the LORD will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; forasmuch as the LORD delivered thee into my hand to-day, and I would not put forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed.</VERS>

And Saul answered: 'I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams; therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Samuel said: 'Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine adversary?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the LORD hath wrought for Himself; as He spoke by me; and the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the LORD, and didst not execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moreover the LORD will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me; the LORD will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore affrighted, and said unto him: 'Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spokest unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he refused, and said: 'I will not eat.' But his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she made haste, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="29">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek; and the Israelites pitched by the fountain which is in Jezreel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said the princes of the Philistines: 'What do these Hebrews here?' And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines: 'Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away unto me unto this day?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him: 'Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us; for wherewith should this fellow reconcile himself unto his lord? should it not be with the heads of these men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying: Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Achish called David, and said unto him: 'As the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day; nevertheless the lords favour thee not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David said unto Achish: 'But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Achish answered and said to David: 'I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God; notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said: He shall not go up with us to the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and as soon as ye are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="30">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and had taken captive the women and all that were therein, both small and great; they slew not any, but carried them off, and went their way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters; but David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech: 'I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod.' And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David inquired of the LORD, saying: 'Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them?' And He answered him: 'Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake them, and shalt without fail recover all.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they gave him water to drink;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins; and when he had eaten, his spirit came back to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And David said unto him: 'To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou?' And he said: 'I am a young Egyptian, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And David said to him: 'Wilt thou bring me down to this troop?' And he said: 'Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and feasting, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day; and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them; David brought back all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said: 'This is David's spoil.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him; and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said: 'Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then said David: 'Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And who will hearken unto you in this matter? for as is the share of him that goeth down to the battle, so shall be the share of him that tarrieth by the baggage; they shall share alike.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying: 'Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD';</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">to them that were in Beth-el, and to them that were in Ramoth of the South, and to them that were in Jattir;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and to them that were in Aroer, and to them that were in Siphmoth, and to them that were in Eshtemoa;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and to them that were in Racal, and to them that were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them that were in the cities of the Kenites;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and to them that were in Hormah, and to them that were in Bor-ashan, and to them that were in Athach;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and to them that were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="31">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the battle went sore against Saul, an the archers overtook him; and he was in great anguish by reason of the archers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said Saul to his armour-bearer: 'Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and make a mock of me.' But his armour-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armour-bearer, and all his men, that same day together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they put his armour in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</VERS>
